They consisted \nof ophthalmologists, a paediatrician, an obstetrician & gynaecologist, a public \nhealth physician, a family medicine specialist, an optometrist, an assistant \nmedical officer and a nursing sister. There was active involvement of the Review \nCommittee during the process of development of these guidelines.\nLiterature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: Guidelines \nInternational Network (G-I-N); Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD); \nPubMed; Ovid Medline, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, \nEBM Reviews - Health Technology Assessment, Journals full text via OVID search \nengine (refer to Appendix 1 for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists \nof all retrieved articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Experts in the \nfield were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches were conducted \nbetween September 2009 and January 2011. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can \nbe obtained upon request from the CPG Seretariat. \nReference was also made to other guidelines on Diabetic Retinopathy such as \nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern Diabetic \nRetinopathy (2008) and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) \nAustralia Guidelines for the Management of Diabetic Retinopathy (2008). These \nCPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and \nEvaluation (AGREE) prior to them being used as references.\nThe clinical questions were developed under three major subtopics and members \nof the Development Group were assigned individual questions within these \nsubtopics (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The group members met \na total of 16 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature \nretrieved was appraised by at least two members and presented in the form \nof evidence tables and discussed during Development Group meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the \nDevelopment Group and Review Committee. Where evidence was insufficient, \nthe recommendations were made by consensus of both groups. These CPG are \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical \ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.",

Globally there \nis a rising trend in the prevalence of DM due to many factors such as aging, \nurbanisation and increasing prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity. The \nInternational Diabetes Federation (IDF) predicts that the prevalence of DM in \nSouth East Asia will increase by two folds by the year 2025.1, level III The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) has estimated that in the year 2030, Malaysia would have a \ntotal of 2.48 million people with DM.2, level III In Malaysia, the first National Health \nand Morbidity Survey I (NHMS I) conducted in 1986 reported a DM prevalence \nof 6.3%. This had risen to 8.3% in the NHMS II 1996 report. In the latest NHMS \nIII 2006 report, the overall prevalence of DM was 11.6% and 14.9% in those \naged above 18 and 30 years respectively. NHMS I and II involved subjects aged \nabove 30 years while NHMS III was conducted among subjects above 18 years of  \nage.3, level III \nDM is a complex disease with end organ complications. However, good control \nof DM will prevent the onset or retard progression of the various complications \nincluding diabetic retinopathy (DR). In Malaysia, diabetic eye disease is the \ncommonest cause of visual loss among adults of working age. Prevalence of \nDR is closely linked to the duration of DM. At diagnosis, less than 5% will have \nretinopathy while the prevalence rises to 40 - 50% after 10 years. Almost all \npatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and more than 60% patients with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have some degree of retinopathy after 20 years \nof the disease.2, level III Screening and early treatment can prevent substantial visual \nloss in many cases. Late presentation continues to be a major challenge of \nprevention and alleviation of blindness. \nDM prevalence in Malaysia has dramatically risen to almost twice in the \nmagnitude over the last decade. In view of this, efforts to control this chronic \ndisease and early detection of complications such as DR should be intensified. \nThis is important as DR is asymptomatic in its early stage when it is most easily \namenable to treatment. \nTherefore, a DR screening programme must be comprehensive, covering all \nindividuals with DM in Malaysia.",

Based \non ethnicity, Indians have the highest prevalence followed by Malays and  \nChinese.3, level III Among those with DM for more than 15 years, approximately 2% \nbecame blind and 10% developed severe visual handicap.1, level III \nIt has been recommended that all DM patients should have at least a yearly \neye examination.6, level III However, the NHMS III 2006 reported that only 45% of \npatients with known DM ever had an eye examination.3, level III\n2.1.2 Children and Adolescents \nT1DM accounts for over 90% of childhood and adolescent diabetes in most \nwestern countries.7, level III The incidence of T1DM is on the increasing trend \nworldwide. The average annual increase is 4% in Asia, 3.2% in Europe and 5.3 % \nin North America.8, level III In the Asian population, T2DM occurs at a much greater \nprevalence ranging between 50% and 90%.9, level III",

ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY\nA variety of screening modalities are available in detecting and classifying DR. \nOphthalmoscopy is the most commonly used technique to screen for DR. \nHowever, non-mydriatic digital fundus photography is now being widely used. \nThere is a wide variation in the sensitivities and specificities of different screening \nmodalities performed by different screeners. \n5.1 Screening Tools \nThe instruments that can be used for screening are: \n• \nDirect ophthalmoscope\n• \nPAN-ophthalmoscope \n• \nBinocular indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO)\n• \nSlit lamp biomicroscope\n• \nMydriatic fundus camera\n• \nNon-mydriatic fundus camera \n5.1.1 Sensitivity and Specificity of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Tools\nThe UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that DR \nscreening modalities should have a sensitivity of at least 80%, a specificity of at \nleast 95% and a technical failure rate of no greater than 5%.28\nTable 2 describes the diagnostic accuracy of different screening tools. Non-\nmydriatic fundus camera has high sensitivity and specificity. It eliminates the \nneed for pupillary dilatation, promoting compliance, efficiency and safety. The \nfindings by Aptel F et al showed that at least one field photo assessment was \nsufficient to detect DR. However, the Training Module for DR Screening in Malaysia \nrecommends two fields photo assessment.29, level III",
