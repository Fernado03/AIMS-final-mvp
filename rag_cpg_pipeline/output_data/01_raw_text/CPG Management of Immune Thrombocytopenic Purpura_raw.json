For paediatric AND pregnancy articles the previous\nsearch terms were combined with ‘child’ and ‘children’ and pregnancy\nrespectively. The search excluded secondary causes of ITP e.g. ‘drug\ninduced thrombocytopenia’; ‘secondary immune thrombocytopenia’.\n“Related articles were selected and out of these, relevant articles were\nchosen and graded using the modified version of those used by the Catalonia\nAgency for Health Technology Assessment (CAHTA) Spain.\nThis guideline was also adapted from other international guidelines on\nManagement of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura which include\nGuidelines for the Investigation and Management of Idiopathic\nThrombocytopenic Purpura in Adults, Children and in Pregnancy by British\nSociety for Haematology and Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: A\npractice guideline by American Society of Haematology. This guideline is\nalso based on the findings of a systematic review of current medical\nliterature, taking into consideration local practices. The draft guideline was\nposted on both the Ministry of Health Malaysia and Academy of Medicine,\nMalaysia websites for comment and feedback. This guideline has also been\npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines and the Health Technology Assessment and Clinical Practice\nGuidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and approval.\nA systematic approach to the treatment modalities was suggested depending\non the conditions associated with ITP. This is summarised as an algorithm\nof management of ITP in adults, children and pregnancy.\ni",

It\nis an autoimmune disorder characterised by persistent thrombocytopenia\n(peripheral platelet count of less than 150 x109/L) due to autoantibody binding\nto platelet antigen(s) causing their premature destruction by the reticulo-\nendothelial system, in particular the spleen.\nIn childhood, the peak age is 2-4 years, girls and boys are equally affected,\nand in most children the disease is self-limiting with spontaneous recovery\noccurring in several weeks to several months. In adults, ITP is most common\namong young women and the disease is more insidious in its onset and\nchronic in its course 1 Level 9. The true incidence of ITP is still unknown. In\nchildren, the overall incidence of ITP is 4 – 5.3 per 100,000 2  Level 8 ; 3  Level 6. It\nhas been reported that the incidence of chronic adult ITP is around 5.8-6.6\nnew cases per 100,000 population per year in the USA 4  Level 9.\n2.\nITP IN ADULTS\n2.1\nClinical Features\nIn adults, ITP typically has an insidious onset, with no prodromal illness.\nSymptoms and signs are highly variable, ranging from the common\nasymptomatic patient with mild bruising or mucosal bleeding to frank\nhaemorrhage from any site, the most serious of which is intracranial.\nThe most common manifestation in ITP is mucocutaneous bleeding with\npurpura, epistaxis, gingival bleeding and menorrhagia. Overall, bleeding\nsymptoms are uncommon unless the ITP is severe (platelet count < 30x109/\nl) 1 Level 9. The degree of bleeding is largely dependent on the platelet count\nand patients with platelet counts below 10x109/l (and usually below 5x109/l)\nare at greatest risk of bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage.\n2.2\nDiagnosis\nThere is no gold standard diagnostic test to confirm ITP. The diagnosis of\nITP remains clinical and is based principally on the exclusion of other causes\nof thrombocytopenia by the history, physical examination, full blood count,\nperipheral blood film and autoimmune screen.\na.\nClinical\nITP can be defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with no clinically apparent\nassociated conditions or other causes of thrombocytopenia (e.g. HIV\n1",

Pseudo-thrombocytopenia\ndue to EDTA-dependent platelet agglutination is a cause of spuriously low\nplatelet count. This condition occurs in about 0.1% of adults, and is easily\nconfirmed by the finding of a normal platelet count using a sample taken in\ncitrate or heparin rather than EDTA anticoagulant 8 Level 9.\nAn autoimmune screen should be carried out to exclude other autoimmune\ndiseases which may be associated with thrombocytopenia, e.g. systemic\nlupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome. HIV antibody testing\nshould also be done in patients with risk factors for HIV infection 5 Level 9.\nIf the history, physical examination, blood count and peripheral blood film\nexamination are compatible with a diagnosis of ITP and do not include\natypical findings, additional investigations such as bone marrow examination\nand assays for platelet antibodies are not indicated 5  Level 9.\nRecommendations: Indications  for Bone Marrow Examination\n-\nover 60 years of age\n-\nprior to splenectomy\n-\npresence of  atypical features\n-\npoor response to first line treatment (eg. prednisolone) 5 Level 9\n(Grade C)\n-\nrelapsed ITP following complete remission 9 Level 8\n(Grade C)\nAssays for anti-platelet antibodies such as direct platelet\nimmunofluorescence test (PIFT) and assays for antibodies to specific\nplatelet membrane glycoproteins (GP) IIb/IIIa and Ib/IX are not sensitive or\nspecific enough to be recommended as routine tests in the diagnosis of\nITP 10 Level 8 ; 11 Level 8.\nHowever, these tests may be useful in distinguishing between immune and\nnon-immune thrombocytopenia in complex cases such as combination of\nbone marrow failure associated with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia,\n3",

The clinical onset is usually acute, with a spectrum of\nbleeding severity ranging from superficial (petechiae, purpura) to life-\nthreatening. Hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy is absent. The\nmajority will give a history of a viral infection in the preceding 2-4 weeks.\n75% of patients remit spontaneously with 70% achieving platelet count of\nmore than 50 x109/L by the fourth week of illness 67 Level 9.\nThe diagnosis can be made clinically based principally on the history,\nphysical examination (no stigmata of malignant disease or congenital\nthrombocytopenia), full blood count (isolated thrombocytopenia), and\nexamination of the peripheral blood smear (exclude abnormal cells).\nBone marrow examination is seldom required. Less than 4% of 127 children\nhad a different diagnosis from ITP following bone marrow examination 68\nLevel 8.   It is only indicated if the patient is not responding to therapy or before\nstarting steroids (to avoid partially treating an undiagnosed acute leukaemia)\n26  Level 9.\nThe need for other investigations depends on clinical indications :  ANF\nand DNA antibodies in those progressing into chronic ITP, CMV serology in\nthose under 1 year of age, immunoglobulin levels in those with recurrent\ninfections and HIV screening for those at risk e.g. parents with HIV infection,\nintravenous drug users. Coagulation profile is needed for those with\nsuspected non-accidental injury, inherited bleeding disorders or\nmeningococcal infection.\nRecommendations : Diagnosis of ITP in Children\nFull blood count with differential and a peripheral blood film\nexamination are the only two recommended laboratory investigations\nin a child with typical clinical features of ITP\n(Grade C)\nBone marrow examination is only indicated in patients not responding\nto therapy or before starting steroids.
