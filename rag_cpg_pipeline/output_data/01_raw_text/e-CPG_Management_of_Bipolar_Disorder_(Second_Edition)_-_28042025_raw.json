When \nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of \nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done \non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A \nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review \nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

There was \nactive involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during \nthe process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and others \ne.g. Pubmed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). \nThe inclusion criteria includes everyone at risk and with bipolar disorder \n(BD) regardless of study design. The first search was limited to \nliterature published in the last eight years (2014 until 2022) on humans \nand in English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature \nand guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. \nExperts in the field were also contacted for studies related to the issues \naddressed. All initial searches were conducted from 2 August 2022 \nto 17 August 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31 December 2023 to be included. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines on BD as listed below:\ni.\t Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) \nand International Society for Bipolar Disoder (ISBD) - Guidelines for \nthe Management of Patients with Bipolar Disorder (2018)\nii.\t Ministry of Health, Malaysia - Clinical Practice Guidelines on \nManagement of Bipolar Disorder (2014)\niii.\t National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - Guideline \non the Assessment and Management of Bipolar Disorder in Adults, \nChildren and Young People in Primary and Secondary Care (2014)\niv.\t Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists \n(RANZCP) - The 2020 RANZCP Clinical Practice Guidelines for \nMood Disorders (2020)\nA total of 18 main clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions.

            "text": "1\nManagement of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\n1.\t\nINTRODUCTION\nBipolar disorder (BD) is a potentially life-long disabling condition \npresenting commonly as either bipolar I disorder (BD I) or bipolar II \ndisorder (BD II). BD I is characterised by episodes of mania (abnormally \nelevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with severe \nfunctional impairment or psychotic symptoms for seven days or more). \nOn the other hand, BD II is characterised by episodes of hypomania \n(abnormally elevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with \ndecreased or increased function for four days or more) and depressive \nepisodes.\nBD is a severe mental disorder. Based on World Health Organisation \n(WHO) statistics in 2019, its global prevalence was estimated to be \naround 40 million.1 In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, the \nprevalence of BD showed an increasing trend from 24.8 million in 1990 \nto 39.5 million in 2019.2 Its prevalence in Malaysia, however, is not \nwell-established. BD is associated with reduced functioning, cognitive \nimpairment and decreased quality of life (QoL). It is also one of the \nleading causes of disability in young people and increased mortality, \nespecially by suicide.3\nDiagnosis of BD may be difficult given the complexity of its clinical \npresentation which may overlap with other psychiatric disorders and \nchange over time. Moreover, managing BD is limited by the lack of \nresources including expertise and medications. Poor adherence \nremains a major issue that needs to be tackled in its management.\nThe first edition of the CPG Management of BD in Adults was published \nin 2014. Since then, there have been advances in the management \nof BD which include wider medication choices and new treatment \nmodalities that incorporate technological advancement.\nThis revised edition provides updates on the evidence and related \nrecommendations on the current management of BD, keeping in mind \nthe acceptability of the treatment and availability of resources. It also \naddresses the management of children and adolescents, and looks \ninto evidence on psychospirituality as well as complementary and \nalternative medicine. Previous topics on psychosocial interventions, \nsuicide prevention and management in pregnant and lactating women \nare further expanded.\nThis CPG is aimed to be used at primary, secondary, and tertiary health \ncare settings. It is also useful for those involved in psychiatric training. It \nis hoped that this CPG will be of benefit to healthcare professionals and \nhelp improve the management of patients with BD.",

There is ample evidence on the effectiveness of treatment in \nacute mood episodes and the prevention of relapses in the maintenance \nphase.\nMedications with mood-stabilising properties include lithium, antiepileptic \nagents (e.g. valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), haloperidol and \nAAPs. Choice of medications is based on the effectiveness, safety, \navailability and affordability of the medication, concomitant medications, \nresponse to previous medication, family history of medication response, \npatient preference as well as medical and psychiatric co-morbidities. \nRefer to Appendix 5 on Recommended Adult Medication Dosages \nand Adverse Effects For Bipolar Disorder.\n•\t Response to treatment is defined as a ≥50% reduction of total score \nin standardised rating scales.\n•\t Remission is an outcome of effectiveness measured by varying cut-\noff points in standardised scales used in clinical trials.\n4.1.1.\t\t\nManic episode\nThe manic episode in BD poses its challenges with patients potentially \nhaving agitation, impulsivity, risky behaviour, aggression and reduced \ninsight.
