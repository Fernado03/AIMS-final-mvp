They consisted of paediatric endocrinologists, \npaediatricians, adult endocrinologists, a geriatrician, a family medicine \nspecialist, public health physicians and a pharmacist. There was \nactive involvement of the Review Committee during the process of \ndevelopment of these guidelines.\nLiterature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: \nPUBMED/MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews \n(CDSR), International Health Technology Assessment websites, Journal \nfull text via OVID search engine, Database of Abstracts of Reviews \nof Effectiveness and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Refer to \nAppendix 1 for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists of all \nretrieved articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Experts \nin the ﬁeld were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches \nwere conducted between 20 January 2009 and 11 August 2010. This \ndate period should be considered the starting point for searching of new \nevidence for future updates to these guidelines.\nReference was also made to other guidelines on Growth Hormone e.g. \nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Medical guidelines \nFor Clinical Practice for Growth Hormone Use in Adults and Children-\n2003 update; American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists \nMedical Guidelines for Clinical Practice for Growth Hormone Use in \nGrowth Hormone Deﬁcient Adults and Transition Patients Children-\n2009 update; Guidelines for the Availability of Human Growth Hormone \n(hGH)  as a Pharmaceutical Beneﬁt, Department of Health and Ageing, \nAustralia, July 2008; Consensus Statement on the Management of \nthe GH-Treated Adolescent in the Transition to Adult Care, Society \nof European Jornal of Endocrinology, 2005; Update of Guidelines \nfor The Use of Growth Hormone in Children: The Lawson Wilkins \nPediatric Endocrinology Society Drug and Therapeutics Committee, \nThe Journal of Pediatrics, October 2003; Consensus guidelines for the \nDiagnosis and Treatment of Growth Hormone Deﬁciency in Childhood \nand Adolescence: Summary Statement of the GH Research Society, \nEuropean Journal of Endocrinology 2005; and Consensus Guidelines \nfor the Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Growth Hormone \nDeﬁciency: Summary Statement of the Growth Hormone Research \nSociety Workshop on Adult Growth Hormone Deﬁciency 1998.

(Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical \nQuestions). The group members met a total of 26 times throughout the \ndevelopment of these guidelines.  All literature retrieved was appraised \nby at least two members and presented in the form of evidence \ntables and discussed during development group meetings. Later, all \nstatements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by \nboth the development group and review committee. Where evidence \nwas insufﬁcient, the recommendations were made by consensus of \nthe development group and review committee. These CPG are based \nmainly on the ﬁndings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical \ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe articles were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive \nServices Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of \nrecommendation in these guidelines was modiﬁed from grades of \nrecommendation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network \n(SIGN).\nThe draft guideline was posted on the MOH Malaysia ofﬁcial website \nfor comment and feedback. These guidelines had also been presented \nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG \nCouncil, MOH, Malaysia for review and approval.\nOBJECTIVES\nGENERAL OBJECTIVE\nTo provide an evidence-based guidance on the use of growth hormone \n(GH) in children, transition period and adults\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\nü  To improve early recognition of GH deﬁciency \nü  To recognise suitable candidates for GH therapy \nü  To understand the pitfalls in diagnosis of GH deﬁciency\nü  To identify the risks and beneﬁts of GH therapy\nü  To provide guidance for treatment and monitoring treatment effect \nand side effects of GH therapy\nü  To re-evaluate GH treated children during transition period and \nidentify candidates who should continue GH therapy into adulthood\nCLINICAL QUESTIONS \nRefer to Appendix 2",

INTRODUCTION\nGrowth hormone (GH) has been used in clinical practice since 1950s. \nThe initial source of GH was human cadaver pituitary extract. The \nsupply was scarce and the scope of GH usage then was limited only to \nchildren with proven GH deﬁciency. In 1985, pituitary-derived GH was \nbanned because of its association with Creutzfeld Jacob disease. This \ntriggered an acceleration in the biosynthesis of GH via recombinant \nDNA technology.  Today there is an abundant supply of biosynthetic GH \ncommercially.  The use of GH has also expanded markedly beyond GH \ndeﬁciency to conditions without GH deﬁciency where data regarding its \nefﬁcacy and safety in these conditions are still lacking.\nIn Malaysia, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been \ncommercially available since 1985. However, despite its increased \navailability, many GH deﬁcient (GHD) children are still deprived of rhGH \ntherapy due to its high cost and concerns regarding its long-term safety. \nOn the contrary, the broadening of scope of GH therapy also has its \ndrawbacks including its increasing use and abuse of GH in a broad \nvariety of growth disorders without evidence of GH deﬁciency.  \nrhGH therapy should not be taken lightly in view of its high cost, the \nneed of prolonged therapy with close follow up by practicing clinicians \nfamiliar with rhGH therapy, potential adverse effects and the negative \npsychological impact from unsuccessful therapy.\nIn a 25 kg child, at low dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day, the cost of rhGH \napproximates RM950 per month (RM11,400 per year). The cost \nescalates as rhGH dose requirement increases and the child grows \nin stature reaching a hefty sum of more than RM2,000 per month. \nThe duration of rhGH therapy could range from four to ten years for \noptimisation of linear growth to lifelong for severe childhood-onset or \nadult-onset GH deﬁciency. \n \nIn adults, the indications for GH therapy are well deﬁned but the \nenthusiasm for rhGH use has also far exceeded medical evidence. Unlike \nthat in children, the lack of linear growth in adults renders response to \nrhGH therapy more difﬁcult to measure. These CPG speciﬁcally aim \nto evaluate the scientiﬁc and clinical evidence of appropriate rhGH \nuse and abuse in order to put these “indications” into their respective \nscientiﬁc contexts.",

Causes \nof developmental abnormalities include genetic defects affecting the \nGH gene, Pit-1 gene or POU1F1 gene that regulate development \nof pituitary cells secreting GH, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), \nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyrotropin. Diseases of the \nhypothalamus and pituitary may result from acquired causes such as \npituitary tumours, craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, \ninfection of the central nervous system, traumatic head injury and whole \nbody or cranial irradiation.\nThe most common presentation of GH deﬁciency in children is stunted \ngrowth. In view of a wide spectrum of causes of stunted growth in \nchildren, evaluation for GH deﬁciency in a short child should not be \ninitiated until other causes of growth failure such as hypothyroidism, \nchronic systemic diseases, syndromic disorders including Turner \nsyndrome (TS) and skeletal disorders have been considered and \nappropriately excluded. In neonates and infants, signs and symptoms \nof GH deﬁciency differ from older children. While deviation from linear \ngrowth is the primary presentation in older children, metabolic effects of \nGHD are the primary presentation in neonates and infants. \n1.2 \nWHO SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR GH DEFICIENCY?\nThe consensus guidelines (GH Research Group, 2000) recognised \nthe key facts in history and physical examination that may indicate \nGH deﬁciency in the neonates. These include neonatal history of \npersistent hypoglycaemia, prolonged neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, \nmicrophallus, traumatic delivery or presence of craniofacial midline\nabnormalities.1, Level III; 2, Level II, 3, level II; Positive history of intracranial \ntumour,4, level II-3 cranial surgery, head injury  either from complications \nat birth or from trauma,5, Level I; 6, level II-3 central nervous system infection, \ncranial irradiation7, Level III should also alert the clinician of the diagnosis \nof GH deﬁciency in a short and slowly growing child.",

Height measurements may be imprecise due to errors \nrelated to operator and/or measuring tool. Errors can also occur in the \ncalculation of HV due to seasonal variation in growth and short time \ninterval between measurements. To minimise errors in HV, serial height \nmeasurements should be performed by a trained personnel, using an \nappropriate tool and a longer time interval between measurements \n(which should not be less than three months). \nHowever, Voss LD et al. showed no correlation between HV in two \nconsecutive years in short normal children and GHD children which \nindicated severe imprecision of HV.11, level II-2 Hintz also showed \nno signiﬁcant difference in height standard deviation score (SDS) \nand HV between GHD and idiopathic short stature (ISS).12, Level II-2\nUsing a HV less than 25th percentile to diagnose GH deﬁciency has a \nhigh sensitivity (82%) but poor speciﬁcity (43%).13, Level II-3 Hence using \nauxology alone is inadequate for the diagnosis of GHD. Auxology must \nbe interpreted in combination with other parameters.\n2.1.2 Biochemical Tests\nGH stimulation tests play a critical role in diagnosis of GH deﬁciency. \nThe most frequently used tests include the insulin tolerance test (ITT) \nand glucagon stimulation test (GST). Other stimulation tests using \npharmacologic agents such as arginine, growth hormone-releasing \nhormone (GHRH) with or without arginine, levodopa and clonidine \nhave been used.14, Level II-2 In local setting, only ITT, GST and arginine \nstimulation test (AST) are used due to unavailability of other agents. \nPeak plasma GH level of <10 mcg/L during GH stimulation tests using \npharmacologic agents has been used as the biochemical criteria for the \ndiagnosis of GH deﬁciency.9, Level III; 8, Level II; Cut-off value of <10 mcg/L is \narbitrarily used to deﬁne GH deﬁciency.  A minimum of two stimulation \ntests indicating GH deﬁciency are required for biochemical conﬁrmation \nof the diagnosis because of the high frequency of negative results for a \nsingle test.15, Level II-3\nInsulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin growth factor binding \nprotein-3 (IGFBP-3) are helpful parameters for diagnosis of GH \ndeﬁciency.

Sex-steroid priming prior to GH stimulation tests reduces the \npercentage of false positive for GH deﬁciency.17, Level 1; 18, Level II-3 Hence \nsex-steroid priming may play a role in reducing the number of false \npositive results in the peripubertal children. Children with MPHD should \nreceive adequate adrenal and thyroid hormone replacement before \nbiochemical evaluation of GH deﬁciency.\nGH Testing in the neonate: GH level should be measured in the event \nof neonatal hypoglycemia in the absence of a metabolic disorder. A \nrandom GH measurement in a polyclonal radioimmunoassay of <20 \nmcg/L would suggest GH deﬁciency in the newborn. An IGFBP-\n3 measurement is of value for the diagnosis of GHD infant.9, Level III  \nITT is regarded as the gold standard for the evaluation of pituitary \ngrowth hormone reserve. In ITT, insulin is administered intravenously \nto produce a nadir in the plasma glucose level of ≤ 2.2 mmol/L. This \nis a potentially hazardous procedure and must be done only by an \nexperienced endocrinologist in a tertiary centre.\nPitfalls in biochemical tests: GH in circulation consists of a wide \nvariety of molecular isoforms. As a consequence, assays involving \npolyclonal antisera give higher results than those based on monoclonal \nassays. Discrepancy between results obtained from two different \nassays depends on factors related to the assay (antibody speciﬁcity \nand assay design) and also factors related to individual sample (relative \nabundance of isoforms present). Therefore it is impossible to compare \nresults from different immunoassays from different laboratories.19, Level III\nGH stimulation tests lack precision, accuracy and have poor \nreliability.20, Level III; 15, Level II-3 The lack of reliability of these tests \nmight be improved by performing the same test more than\nonce.15, Level II-3 Factors like puberty, genetic target height SDS, \nheight SDS, weight SDS, bone age and the pharmacologic agents \nused can affect peak plasma GH level.15, Level II-3 Spontaneous GH \nsecretion is more speciﬁc than pharmacologic testing.

(Grade C) \n5.3 \nDIAGNOSIS \nThe diagnosis of GH deﬁciency in adults should ideally be based on \ncorrect identiﬁcation of clinical features in individuals at risk of GH \ndeﬁciency and biochemical conﬁrmation. The diagnosis of GHD is \nconﬁrmed by performing stimulation tests. Commonly used tests are \nITT, glucagon stimulation test, arginine with/without growth hormone \nreleasing hormone (GHRH) (ARG plus GHRH) test. Comparison of \nthese different diagnostic tests has shown that the ITT and ARG plus \nGHRH tests were better to differentiate between GHD patient from \nnormal persons.175, level III In the KIMS global database of adult GHD, \nthese two stimulation tests were the most commonly used.169, level II-3 \nHowever, GHRH is not available in Malaysia.\nThe cut off value to diagnose GH deﬁciency in adults is GH level that \nis less than 5.1 mcg/l. This value will provide 96% sensitivity and \n92% speciﬁcity. The GH assay used for this particular cut off is an \nimmunochemiluminometric assay.175, level III  If a patient has three or four \npituitary hormone deﬁciencies in addition to a low IGF-1 level (below -2 \nSD), in the absence of conditions that lower IGF-1, the probability of GH \ndeﬁciency being documented on stimulation testing is more than 90% \nand thus stimulation test is necessary to make the diagnosis.142, level II-3 \nIn most circumstances, the biochemical diagnosis of GH deﬁciency in \nan adult would require only one stimulation test.176, level III\nITT is contraindicated in patients with electrocardiographic evidence \nor history of ischaemic heart disease or in patients with seizure \ndisorders.166, Level III Since ITT can cause seizures,177, level III it might be \nprudent to avoid it in patients with a history of previous stroke as well.

The review \nfound that although exogenous GH was associated with an increase \nin lean body mass (mean of 2.1 kg, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.9), there was no \nsigniﬁcant improvement in actual strength and exercise capacity. In \nfact, two out of three studies that measured exercising lactate levels \nshowed signiﬁcantly higher exercising lactate levels in rhGH-treated \nsubjects suggesting that GH therapy may worsen exercise capacity. \nrhGH treated subjects were more frequently experiencing adverse \nevents such as soft tissue oedema and fatigue compared to those not \ntreated with GH.216, level I\nRecommendation\nrhGH therapy should not be used to enhance athletic performance. \n(Grade A)\n6.6  INFERTILITY\nThere are no studies that have looked at the use of rhGH alone in \ninfertile women with normal pituitary function. Most evidence has looked \nat rhGH as an adjunct to other treatments for infertility.\nA Cochrane systematic review of nine RCT by Harper K et al in 2003 \nspeciﬁcally looked at the use of rhGH therapy to improve outcomes of \nin-vitro fertilisation (IVF) in women. This review found no evidence that",

Five of \nthe six studies using rhGH therapy showed no signiﬁcant improvement \nin measures of fertility (such as serum oestradiol, duration of follicular \nphase, number of oocytes and pregnancy rate).

(Grade B)\n6.7  OBESITY\nIt is known that the endogenous secretion of GH in obese individuals \nis decreased although the exact physiological role of GH in obesity is \nunclear. \nA recent meta-analysis of 24 RCTs looked at the efﬁcacy and safety \nof rhGH therapy in simple adult obesity (i.e. not associated with \ndistinct clinical syndromes). Treatment with very high dosages of rhGH \ntherapy led to very small improvement in waist-hip ratio and fat mass in \nsubjects treated with rhGH therapy compared to placebo. There were \nno signiﬁcant differences in body weight, BMI, subcutaneous fat area, \nresting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient and blood pressure. \nHowever, there were signiﬁcant increase in adverse events associated \nwith rhGH therapy including arthralgia, paraesthesias and oedema. The \nbeneﬁcial effects appear to be quantitatively small and would not justify \na clinically relevant role for rhGH therapy in obesity.219, level I\nRecommendation\nrhGH therapy should not be used in the treatment of simple adult \nobesity.
