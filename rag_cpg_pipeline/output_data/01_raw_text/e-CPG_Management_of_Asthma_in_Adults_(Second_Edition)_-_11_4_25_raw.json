The quality of body of evidence and related effect \nsize are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG DG.\n•\t Recommendations are formulated based on certainty of \nevidence and the wording used denotes the strength of \nrecommendations.

Otherwise, weak recommendations use the \nword “may” in proposing an action to be made.\n•\t In the CPG, a yellow box           highlights important message(s) in \nthe management while a blue box            contains evidence-based \nrecommendation(s) for the particular condition.",

Spirometry is the preferred tool to demonstrate airway \nobstruction variability or reversibility.\nGeneral Principles\n•\t The assessment of asthma control should be performed before \nconsidering stepping up or down the treatment. \nPatient Education\n•\t Regular medical reviews in asthma patients are preferred over \nself-adjustment of medications aided by asthma action plan.\nStable Asthma\n•\t Assessment of asthma should include:  \n\t\n\t evaluating current asthma symptoms control using validated \ntools \n\t\n\t identifying future exacerbation risk factors and co-morbidities\n\t\n\t checking adherence, inhaler techniques and other treatment \nrelated issues\n•\t In the treatment of asthma:\n\t\n\t inhaled short-acting β2-agonists (SABA) should not be used as \nmonotherapy\n\t\n\t inhaled SABA may be used as reliever therapy with regular \ninhaled corticosteroids (ICS)\n•\t All asthma patients should be on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-\ncontaining therapy.\n•\t Asthma patients who smoke or vape should be strongly encouraged \nto quit at every clinic visit.",

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review \nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines \nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans, \npublication from year “2017 to Current” and English language. In \naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were \nsearched, and experts in the field contacted to identify relevant studies. \nAll searches were conducted from 17 January 2023 to 5 March 2023. \nLiterature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of \nthe CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published \nbefore 31 July 2024 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search \nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on Asthma which included:\n•\t Global Initiative for Asthma – Global Strategy for Asthma \nManagement and Prevention (2024)\n•\t Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR)] \n– GEMA 5.3. Spanish Guideline on the Management of Asthma \n(2023)\n•\t British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines \nNetwork – British Guideline on the Management of Asthma (2019)\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of 21 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG \nmembers met 23 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the two groups. This CPG was developed \nlargely based on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.",

Recognising and addressing this diagnostic challenge is \na key focus of this CPG, which aims to improve asthma care through \nevidence-based recommendations. \nAsthma continues to pose significant public health challenges, affecting \nmillions globally and thousands in Malaysia. Despite advances in \ndisease understanding and treatment, asthma remains frequently \nmisdiagnosed or poorly managed, resulting in avoidable suffering, \nhospitalisations and even deaths.\nThe inaugural CPG for asthma in adults, introduced in 2017, was a \nlandmark achievement in standardising asthma care. It set a strong \nfoundation for evidence-based practice and improved patient outcomes. \nSince then, the rapidly evolving landscape of asthma management - \nincluding the advent of biologics for severe asthma e.g. omalizumab, \nbenralizumab and dupilumab - has necessitated a comprehensive \nupdate. With two additional biologics currently in the pipeline, i.e. \ntezepelumab and mepolizumab, this updated CPG aims to provide \nclinicians with the latest evidence-based resource to deliver the highest \nstandard of care for asthma patients.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for innovative \nand adaptable healthcare solutions. Recognising this, the MoH is \nactively exploring the development of online inhaler technique tutorials, \nwith plans for their release in the near future. These resources, once \navailable, will complement the appendix of inhalers provided in this \nupdated CPG. Together, they aim to enhance inhaler technique, \nempower patients and improve treatment adherence for better asthma \nmanagement.\nFor those with severe asthma, the availability of cutting-edge biologic \ntherapies has transformed the management paradigm. The CPG \nDevelopment Group takes pride in the locally developed algorithm for \nselecting biologics in severe asthma management. Designed by the \ngroup, this tool is comprehensive and user-friendly, providing a practical \nresource for clinicians. \nTailored to the Malaysian context, this CPG acknowledges the \nchallenges of local healthcare system, cultural nuances and prevalent",

            "text": "4\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\n3.\t\nDIAGNOSIS\nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease with distinct inflammatory patterns. \nIn Type 2 (T2)-high asthma, inflammation is driven by T2 cytokines \n[interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13], leading to eosinophilic inflammation, \nelevated IgE and increased fractionated exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) \nlevels. This phenotype is typically responsive to inhaled corticosteroids \n(ICS) and biologics targeting T2 pathways. In contrast, neutrophilic \nasthma is associated with low or absent T2 inflammation and may \ninvolve IL-17 and other non-T2 cytokines, with neutrophilic inflammation \nand steroid resistance often observed.\n•\t There is no gold standard test in diagnosing asthma. The diagnosis \nis based on a combination of clinical history, physical examination \nfindings and lung function test with evidence of variable and \nreversible airway obstruction.\nA thorough history taking to identify asthma symptoms is important \nfor accurate diagnosis. Physical examination may appear normal \nparticularly when the patient is not experiencing an asthma exacerbation. \nPhysical examination is important to rule out other conditions with \nsimilar symptoms. Typical clinical signs of asthma include tachypnoea, \nrhonchi, prolonged expiratory phase and decreased breath sounds. \nSpirometry should be used to diagnose asthma whenever possible. \nForced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity \n(FVC) are parameters obtained from spirometry. These parameters are \nused to show evidence of obstructive lung disease and reversibility \n(refer to Table 3).  When spirometry is not available, peak expiratory \nflow meter may be used instead. These tests should be performed \nbefore treatment, at 3 – 6 months after treatment and periodically (1 \n– 2-yearly) to establish patient’s personal best FEV1 and monitor for \nlung function decline. A low FEV1 indicates underlying untreated airway \ninflammation and is a risk factor for future exacerbation.2\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) can be measured using both peak \nflow meter and spirometry machine. Peak flow meter is used primarily \nfor home monitoring. Whereas, spirometry is performed in a clinical \nsetting under supervision of a healthcare provider. Whenever possible, \nPEFR should be recorded before treatment is initiated. It should be \nmonitored at 1-hour post treatment and at regular intervals until a clear \nresponse has occurred or a plateau is reached.2\nIf a patient has already started on treatment, the response to the \ntreatment (bronchodilator or corticosteroids) may aid in the diagnosis \nbut lack of response may not exclude asthma.",

They need to be advised to do PEF reading three \ntimes and record the highest reading in a given table. \nDiurnal PEF variability is calculated from twice daily readings as below:\n                                Day’s highest – Day’s lowest\t\nx 100\n                          (Mean of day’s highest and lowest)\t\nThen the average of each day is calculated over 1 to 2 weeks.\nExample: \nTotal diurnal PEF Variability \t = (11.3 + 23.0 + 25.7 + 22.2 + 23.0 \t\n\t\n\t + 19.6 + 18.5) = 143.3%\nMean Diurnal PEF Variability\t = 143.3 % ÷ 7 days\n                              \t\n= 20.47 %\nDiurnal PEF Variability is significant if the reading is >20% in adults",
