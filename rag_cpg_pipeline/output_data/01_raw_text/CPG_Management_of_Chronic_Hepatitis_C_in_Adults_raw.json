There was active involvement \nof a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nA literature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of \nSystemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International \nNetwork (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The \nsearch was limited to literature published in the last ten years, on \nhumans, adults and in English. In addition, the reference lists of all \nretrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify \nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify \nfurther studies. All searches were conducted from 3 January 2018 \nto 9 January 2019. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31 July 2019 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were made to other guidelines on hepatitis C e.g.\n•\t Guidelines for The Care and Treatment of Persons Diagnosed with \nChronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection (World Health Organization, \n2018)\n•\t EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C (European \nAssociation for the Study of the Liver, 2016 and 2018)\n•\t Hepatitis \nC \nGuidance \n2018 \nUpdate: \nAASLD-IDSA \nRecommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis \nC Virus Infection (American Association for the Study of Liver \nDiseases and Infectious Diseases Society of America, 2018) \nA total of 11 main clinical questions were developed under five different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin five sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 18 times throughout the development of \nthese guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least \ntwo DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, \npresented in evidence tables and further discussed in DG meetings. \nAll statements and recommendations subsequently formulated were \nagreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, \nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC.",

The prevalence rate of people \nliving with HCV infection among those aged 15 - 64 years is 2.5%.2; 3\nMany of the estimated 380,000 people living with hepatitis C remain \nundiagnosed.4 Screening and access to care of HCV is crucial to \nreduce the transmission and address the increasing disease burden \nin the country.2 With the initiatives by the Ministry of Health (MoH) \nMalaysia, in-line with World Health Organization (WHO)’s strategy \ntowards elimination of hepatitis C by 2030, screening and treatment of \nhepatitis C has expanded tremendously. At present, MoH is focussing \non screening the high risk populations in particular people who inject \ndrugs (PWID). The landscape of treatment for hepatitis C has evolved \nwith the accessibility of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) which are \ngenerally effective, well tolerated and given for 12 - 24 weeks.\nLocally, the common genotypes found are genotype 3 (61.9%) and 1 \n(35.9%) which may give variation in treatment regime.5 People who \nare HCV-infected are at risk of developing advanced liver disease, \ncontributing to the continuous rise in HCV-related morbidity and \nmortality. Approximately 60 - 70% of chronically infected person will \neventually develop chronic liver disease of which 5 - 20% will have \ncirrhosis of the liver and 1 - 5% will die of cirrhosis or hepatocellular \ncarcinoma (HCC).2 \nThe primary goal of HCV treatment is to cure the infection i.e. to achieve \na sustained virological response (SVR). In view of high disease burden \nand variation in practice, an evidence-based CPG is required to guide \nhealthcare providers locally in the management of hepatitis C.",

Failure to identify them prevents linkage to \ncare and successful control of HCV. Therefore, screening of hepatitis \nC is an important step towards improving detection and ultimately \ntreatment and cure of infected individuals.\n• Hepatitis C screening is recommended for the following target \npopulations that have increased risk of HCV infection or exposure:6, 7\n\t current or past intravenous drug users\n\t healthcare providers, emergency medical and public safety \nworkers after needle sticks, sharps or mucosal exposures to HCV-\ninfected blood\n\t recipients of blood/blood products/clotting factor concentrates/\norgan transplant before 1994\n\t unexplained chronic liver disease and/or chronic hepatitis \nincluding elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels\n\t people who have exchanged sex for money, goods or favours \n\t men who have sex with men who have additional risk factors \nincluding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, \nreport of traumatic sexual practice (e.g. fisting), diagnosis of \nlymphogranuloma venereum or syphilis, previous resolved or \ntreated hepatitis C infection, engaging in ‘chemsex’ \n\t people with HIV infection\n\t current and past prisoners (incarceration)\n\t people on long-term haemodialysis (HD)\n\t children born to HCV-infected women\n\t intranasal illicit drug users - non-injecting drug users\nIn intermediate to high HCV-prevalence (>2%) countries, programmes \nwith pre-screening selection based on HCV risk profile or migrant \nstatus and programmes in psychiatric clinics are associated with high \nHCV prevalence.8, level III In contrast, programmes targeting healthcare \nworkers (Asian population involved in liver transplantation) and pregnant \nwomen (obstetric/antenatal clinics in United Kingdom, US and Brazil) \nhave low HCV prevalence.9, level I\nIncrease in screening uptake for hepatitis C in primary care can be \nachieved through targeted case finding, support and training of primary \ncare practitioners, alternative HCV testing methods and provision \nof outreach testing.

However, it is less sensitive than HCV \nRNA assay (lower limit of detection equivalent to approximately 500 to \n3,000 HCV RNA IU/mL).14 \nUsing a threshold of quantifiable HCV RNA (≥15 IU/mL), HCVcAg \ndemonstrates consistently high specificity (98 - 100%) at all time-points \nbut a wide range of sensitivity (31 - 100%). Among baseline samples, \nthere is a strong correlation between HCVcAg levels and HCV RNA \nlevels (rs 0.767 - 0.89, p ≤0.0001).15 - 16, level III  \nWHO has suggested that HCVcAg is too limited to recommend for its \nuse as a substitute for HCV RNA as assessment of test of cure, known \nas SVR.17 However, EASL allows this as an alternative if the latter is not \navailable and/or not affordable to be done at SVR 24.14  \n• \nHCV molecular \nHCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect the \npresence of the virus, determine if the infection is active and if the \nindividual would benefit from antiviral treatment. This assay detects the \npresence of viral RNA through targeting a specific segment of the virus. \nThe use of quantitative or qualitative molecular test for detection of HCV \nRNA is recommended as the preferred strategy to diagnose viraemic \ninfection following a reactive HCV antibody serological test. The new \ngeneration of quantitative and qualitative assays have the same lower \ndetection limit (around 15 IU/mL).

RBV \nadministration should be stopped if the level drops below 8.5 g/dL.14\nA 10-fold increase in ALT activity at any time during DAAs treatment \nshould prompt its discontinuation. An increase in ALT <10-fold that \nis accompanied by any clinical symptoms (e.g. weakness, nausea, \nvomiting, jaundice) or biochemical derangements (increased bilirubin, \nalkaline phosphatase or INR) should also prompt discontinuation \nof treatment. Asymptomatic increases in ALT <10-fold should be \nclosely monitored with repeat ALT testing at 2-week intervals. If the \nlevels remain persistently elevated, consideration should be given to \ndiscontinuation of treatment.28\nHIV/HCV \nco-infection, \nHBV/HCV \nco-infection, \ncirrhosis, \nrenal \nimpairment, presence of potential DDIs and ill-health patients may also \nnecessitate more frequent monitoring.11 Increment of indirect bilirubin \nshould be monitored in patients receiving OrPD. Renal function should \nbe checked monthly in patients with reduced eGFR receiving SOF.14\nHCV RNA should be tested at 12 weeks post-treatment to assess the \neffectiveness of the DAAs.",
