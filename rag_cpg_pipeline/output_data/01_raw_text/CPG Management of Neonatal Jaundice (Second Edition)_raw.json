There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nThe previous CPG entitled Management of Jaundice in Healthy Term \nNewborns 2003 was used as the basis for the development of the \npresent guidelines. A literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N); Medline \nvia Ovid, Pubmed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews \n(CDSR) (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The \ninclusion criteria are all literature on neonatal jaundice occurring less \nthan two weeks, regardless of study design. The search was limited \nto literature published in the last ten years, humans and in English. In \naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were \nsearched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were \nalso contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted \nfrom 29 May 2013 to 23 June 2014. Literature searches were repeated \nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process \nallowing any relevant papers published before 31 August 2014 to be \nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other CPG on neonatal jaundice developed \nby National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children’s Health \n(2010)/National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) \n(2010) and American Academy of Pediatrics (2004 and 2009). The \nCPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and \nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.\nA total of 14 clinical questions were developed under different sections. \nMembers of the DG were assigned individual questions within these \nsections. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions) The DG \nmembers met 18 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nThe literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion \nwere resolved consensually. These guidelines were based largely on",

All babies have a \ntransient rise in serum bilirubin but only about 75% are visibly jaundiced. \nJaundice is clinically detectable when the serum bilirubin levels are >85 \nμmol/L (5 mg/dl). NNJ is more common among Asian babies and varies \nwith races. There are also other risk factors that may be associated \nwith severe jaundice including prematurity, G6PD deficiency and ABO \nincompatibility. Due to improving survival rates of preterm babies, and \nbetter identification of risk factors over the years, there is a need to \naddress the management of jaundice in this group of babies. \nHyperbilirubinaemia is either unconjugated or conjugated. Without \ntreatment, high levels of unconjugated bilirubin may lead to acute and \nchronic bilirubin encephalopathy. This may cause to neurodevelopmental \nproblems including athetoid cerebral palsy, hearing loss and visual \nimpairment.\nThe CPG on the Management of Jaundice in Healthy Term Newborns \nwas developed in 2003 as a guide to clinical practice, based on the \nbest available evidence at that time. Since then, novel techniques in \nthe assessment of NNJ, different modalities of treatment and newer \nconcepts of prevention have been introduced. Based on recent evidence, \nthis CPG aims to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision-making \nand to provide a standard framework for the management of NNJ in \nthe country.",

Post-mortem \nicteric (yellow) staining of the basal ganglia, specifically the globus \npallidus is the hallmark of this condition.14\nBilirubin-Induced Neurologic Dysfunction (BIND)\nBIND is a wider spectrum of disorders that not only includes classic \nkernicterus and ABE, but also less severe forms of neuropathy, \nincluding auditory neuropathy, fine and gross motor incoordination, gait \nabnormalities, fine tremors, exaggerated extrapyramidal reflexes and \nbehavioural problems.14\n           \nKernicterus is a rare condition due to severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. \nIt is associated with a high mortality, and survivors usually suffer \nsequelae such as athetoid cerebral palsy, intellectual disability and \nhigh frequency hearing loss. Preventing and treating severe neonatal \nhyperbilirubinaemia is crucial to prevent kernicterus. \nIn North America and Europe, the estimated incidence of kernicterus \nranges from 0.4 to 2.7 cases per 100,000 live births among term and \nlate preterm babies.15, level III In a Danish study, the incidence of acute \nadvanced and chronic bilirubin encephalopathy among babies more than \n35 weeks was 0.6 per 100 000 live births (95% CI 0.1 to 1.7).16, level III\nRisk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity are isoimmune hemolytic \ndisease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, sepsis, acidosis and albumin \n<3.0mg/dL.6 The risk may be increased by a prolonged exposure to \na certain TSB level.

This aims to \nprevent long-term morbidity and mortality.\n16.1 \tFacilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG \ninclude:-\n1.\t wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies \nand softcopies)\n2.\t regular continuous medical education on NNJ to healthcare \nproviders\n3.\t reporting of cases with severe NNJ [TSB ≥20 mg/dL (342 µmol/L)]\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG are:-\n1.\t poor assessment of NNJ and limited knowledge on its management \n2.\t insufficient resources in the management of NNJ\n3.\t variation in treatment practice and preferences \n16.2 \tPotential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong a commitment to:- \n1.\t ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare providers \nvia printed and electronic copies.\n2.\t strengthen training (with adequate funding) of healthcare providers \nby regular seminars or workshops to ensure information is up-to-\ndate\n3.\t ensure availability of equipment for measuring bilirubin levels and \nmanaging NNJ in both health clinics and hospitals\n4.\t ensure empowerment of caregivers via education materials\n5.\t improve the current reporting system to include bilirubin \nencephalopathy and other related parameters\nTo assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following is proposed \nas clinical audit indicator for quality management:-\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of \nthe CPG by MoH. They are such a Quick Reference and a Training \nModule.\nIncidence of \nsevere \nNNJ*\n=\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n                     X  10,000\nTotal number of live births in the same period\nNumber of babies with severe NNJ* in a month\n*Severe NNJ is defined as TSB ≥20 mg/dL or ≥342 µmol/L",
