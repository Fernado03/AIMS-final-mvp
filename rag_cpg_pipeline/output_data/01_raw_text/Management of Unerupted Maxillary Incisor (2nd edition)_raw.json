The Review Committee was \nactively involved in the development process of these guidelines.\nThe previous edition of the CPG on Management of Unerupted Maxillary \nIncisor (August 2006) was used as the basis for the development of \nthis CPG. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. \nIn addition to the general text and photographic updates, new and \nupdated information has been included in the management such as the \nuse of Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), updates in surgical \nand restorative components, key messages and recommendations. \nIn addition, clinical audit indicators have also been identified for the \npurpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.\nAs part of the reviewing process, new evidences were retrieved \nfrom publications from year 2006 to June 2015. Literature search \nwas carried out using the following electronic databases: PUBMED/\nMEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); ISI \nWeb of Knowledge; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and full \ntext journal articles via OVID search engine.  The reference lists of \nall relevant articles retrieved were also searched to identify further \nstudies. Free text terms or MeSH terms were used either singly or in \ncombination to retrieve the articles (Appendix 1). Only literature in \nEnglish was retrieved.\n \nThere were 14 clinical questions assigned to members of the \ndevelopment group. The group members met a total of seven times \nthroughout the development of this CPG. Literature retrieved were \nappraised by at least two members and presented in the form of \nevidence table and discussed during group meetings. All statements \nand recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the \ndevelopment group and review committee. This CPG is based largely \non scientific evidences and adapted according to local practices. \nHowever, where there was a lack of evidence, recommendations were \nbased on consensus of group members.
