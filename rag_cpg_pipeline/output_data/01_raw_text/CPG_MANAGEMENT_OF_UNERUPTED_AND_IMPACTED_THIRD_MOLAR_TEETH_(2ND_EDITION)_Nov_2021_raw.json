They are intended as a guide for the best clinical practice \nin the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molar teeth presently. However, it must be \nnoted that adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in \nindividual patient care, as every health care provider is responsible for the management of his/her \nunique patient based on the clinical presentation and management options available locally.\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in November 2021 and will be reviewed in 2026 or earlier if important \nnew evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, the head of the related specialty will \nbe informed about it. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will be done on the need \nfor a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. The systematic review methodology used by \nthe Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed in reviewing the \nguidelines. \nEvery care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of publication. \nHowever, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this \ndocument, which is the definitive version at all times.",

The \nrecommendations were formulated taking into consideration the best available evidence and \nlocal practices. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. The scope has \nbeen expanded to include new and updated information. In addition, clinical audit indicators \nhave also been identified for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.\nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic databases: Medline, \nPubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and Embase while full text \njournal articles were retrieved from these databases. The literature search was limited to \nhuman study, English language and published articles from 2006 to September 2021. In \naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further \nidentify relevant studies. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-\noff date. An example of the search strategy used can be found in Appendix 1. Details of the \nsearch strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nThere were five (5) clinical questions which were assigned to members of the development \ngroup. The group members met a total of 22 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All retrieved articles were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme \n(CASP) checklist by at least two members, presented in the form of evidence tables and \ndiscussed during group meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were \nagreed upon by both the development group and reviewers. This CPG is based on the \nfindings of systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, observational studies and case \nreports, with local practices taken into consideration. However, when there was lack of \nevidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group members. Although ideally \npatients’ views and preferences need to be considered in the development of CPGs, in this \ninstance, it was not feasible.",

            "text": "1\nManagement of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth\n1.\t\nINTRODUCTION\nThird molars, also known as wisdom teeth, are generally the last teeth to erupt after the age \nof seventeen. The position of the teeth is posterior to the second molars, where space can be \nlimited for the eruption to take place. Impaction of third molars can be due to several factors, \nincluding lack of space, obstruction by adjacent structures or tooth and abnormal position \nduring tooth development. 1 Impacted third molars can be entirely or partially covered by \nbone and/or soft tissue. Wisdom teeth that are partially erupted in dental arches are usually \nvisible clinically, but have not achieved the normal functional position. \nThe average rate of third molar impaction worldwide was 24.4% in adults 17 years and above. \nThe prevalence of mandibular impaction (25.4%) was significantly higher than maxillary \nimpaction (14.2%). Adults with impacted wisdom teeth would commonly have one or two \nimpacted wisdom teeth rather than three or four impacted teeth. There was no significant \npredilection between genders on the occurrence of impacted third molars. In terms of angle \nof impaction, clinicians would more likely encounter mesio-angular impaction (41.2%), \nfollowed by vertical (25.6%), disto-angular (12.2%) and horizontal impaction (11.1%). 2\nThe introduction of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has led clinicians to consider \nits usage for three-dimensional assessment of third molars and its relationship with adjacent \nstructures, particularly inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). However, there is a need to address its \nclinical usefulness in these cases. \nSurgical removal of third molar is associated with the risk of IAN injury. In the last two \ndecades, a new surgical technique, coronectomy, has been introduced to reduce the risk \nof IAN injury. There has been much debate among clinicians with regards to this technique. \nIn view of new developments in the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molar, \nthis CPG is updated to include the aforementioned issues. Thus, evidence-based decision \nmaking in managing unerupted and impacted third molars is necessary to allow clinicians \nto identify and assess updated multifactorial aspects relevant to the management of this \nspecific dental condition.",
