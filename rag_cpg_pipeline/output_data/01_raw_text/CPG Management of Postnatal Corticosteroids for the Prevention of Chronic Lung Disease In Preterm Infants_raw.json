            "text": "Postnatal Corticosteroids for the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic\nLng Disease in Preterm Infants\n\nClinical trial evidence fo the effectiveness of corcosteridsin the prevention\n‘of CLD is strong andthe use ofthis treatment inthe clinical setting has become\npopular, Follow up studies have started to appear inthe literature and have\nsuggested that there may be a danger in this practice'*, Thiselinical pectice\n‘guideline attempts to provide some puidanc tothe practicing Paediatrician on\nthe interpretation of this evidence in the clinical setting.\n\n1, Terminology\n\n‘The term bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was frst used by Northway in\n1967 to describe a condition characterized by chronic respiratory failure in\n‘neonates treated with mechanical ventilation fora primary lung disease Today\n‘most neonates with chronic respiratory fulure are preterms with a bistory of\n{reatment by mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome. The\ndisease tends to be ess severe and does not follow the clinical and X-ray\nphases described by Northway.\n\n‘Theres no diagnostic marker forthe condition so although the onset ofthe\nconditions known o occu very early in postnatal if, the diagnosis made in\ninfants who remain oxygen dependent ain whom other conditions have been\n«excluded. BPD is commonly defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of|\nage. Some definitions also include X-ray evidence of BPD or history of\n‘mechanical ventilation in the fst week of life.\"” One ofthe weaknesses of\nthis definition isthatits very common for very preterm infants below 28 weeks\n‘estaion to require oxygen for more than 28 days and most of these are\n‘normal, Chronic lung disease (CLD) generally refers tinfans below 32 weeks\n‘who remain oxygen dependent at 36 weeks postmensral age. This definition\nhhasben found to bea more accurate predictor of long term outcome. Inthe\nclinical sting the terms are often used interchangeably. This guideline wsesthe\ntermCLD and refers either definition above: thatis oxygen dependeney at\n28 daysof life oF a 36 weeks postmenstrual age.\n\nwm",

            "text": "However defined, chronic lung disease is an important problem. Severe cases\n!have pulmonary hypertension and progress to cor pulmonale whichis usually\nfatal. The treatment of CLD is costly. Most infants require a prolonged hospital\nsay and some continue with home oxygen therapy after discharge. Infans with\nCLD require more frequent hospital admission and havea higher tsk of dying\nduring the first year of life. Poor growth and abnormal neurological\n{development are additional problems that these infants may fae.\n\n2. Incidence\n\n‘The incidence of CLD depends onthe definition. Inthe Malaysian Paediatric\nAssociation Very Low Bin Weight (VLBW) sty, 4% of 962 VLBW infants\n‘born in 20 Malaysian hospitals were oxygen dependant at 28 days and had\nX-ray evidence of BPD while 28% died and 689% were normal.” In\ndeveloped countries where the morality is lower BPD has reported in 11 10\n'57% of survivors\"! Survival of VLBW infants is rapidly improving in\nMalaysia and it is reasonable to assume that CLD will become more\n\n3. Corticosteroids\n\nInflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CLD. This progresses\nto lung destruction and abnormal repair, Corticosteroids have been Found to\nreduce the inflammatory response and decrease airways resistance.\n\n“There are 9 systematic reviews examining the evidence for systemic postnatal\ncorticosteroids, mainly dexamethasone, inthe prevention and treatment of chronic\nJung disease.” Inthe 3 most complete ofthese, more than 35 randomised\ncontrolled trials are reviewed >>> These used courses of therapy ranging from\n31042 days, A 12~ 14 day course seems tobe the most common.*** Early\npost natal steroids refers to coticosteroids begun within the ist 96 hours after\nbirth; moderately eatly, 7-14 days after birth; and delayed 3 or more weeks\nafter birth\n\nCorticosteroids have also been used in neonates for the prevention and\n{treatment of post-extubation stridor and extubation failure and may have some\n\ntenett™\na3)",
