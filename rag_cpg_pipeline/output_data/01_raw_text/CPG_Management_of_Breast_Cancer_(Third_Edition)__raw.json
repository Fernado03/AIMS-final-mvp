There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary \nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nThe CPG update was done based on the first edition of evidence-\nbased CPG on Management of Breast Cancer (Second Edition), issued \nin 2010. In the update, certain methodology was used e.g. GRADE \nprinciples while the scope on assessment and diagnosis, treatment and \nfamilial breast cancer was expanded. A chapter on fertility preservation \nwas also introduced. A literature search was carried out using the \nfollowing electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane \nDatabase of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines \nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published in the last \nfour years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of \nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify \nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify \nfurther studies. All searches were conducted from 23 November 2017 \nto 6 January 2018. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31 July 2019 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were made to other CPGs on Breast Cancer e.g.\n•\t Early and locally advanced breast cancer: diagnosis and \nmanagement [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \n(NICE), 2018]\n•\t Familial breast cancer: classification care and managing breast \ncancer and related risks in people with a family history of breast \ncancer (NICE, 2018)\n•\t Treatment of primary breast cancer (Scottish Intercollegiate \nGuideline Network, 2013)\n•\t Breast Cancer Version 1.2019 [National Comprehensive Cancer \nNetwork (NCCN), 2019]\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as references.\nA total of 33 clinical questions were developed under eight different \nsections (risk factors, screening, referral, assessment/diagnosis, \nstaging, treatment, survivorship programme and familial breast",

Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin eight sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 26 times throughout the development of \nthese guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least \ntwo DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, \npresented in evidence tables and further discussed in DG meetings. \nAll statements and recommendations subsequently formulated were \nagreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, \nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. \nThis CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-\nanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of \nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG strictly \nfollows the requirement of AGREE II. \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external \nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for \nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented \nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG and, the HTA and CPG \nCouncil MoH Malaysia for review and approval. Details on the CPG \ndevelopment methodology by MaHTAS can be obtained from Manual \non Development and Implementation of Evidence-based Clinical \nPractice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh.\ngov.my/moh/resources/CPG_MANUAL_MAHTAS.pdf?mid-634).",

For \nexample, NICE recommends unaffected women aged 35 years and \nolder and with no physical symptoms of breast cancer may be stratified \ninto four categories using BOADICEA risk assessment tool for the \npurpose of screening recommendations:5 \n•\t average risk (<17% lifetime risk)\n•\t moderate risk (>17% but <30% lifetime risk)\n•\t high risk (>30% lifetime risk but no known genetic variant)\n•\t high risk carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants\nWhilst the above tools are accurate for the population, they are less \nuseful for individual risk prediction.

It also \nfacilitates outcome monitoring and quality assessment.\nIt contains a lexicon for standardised terminology (descriptors) for \nmammography, breast US and MRI, as well as chapters on Report \nOrganisation and Guidance for use in daily practice.\nA.\t REPORT ORGANISATION\nA good reporting system should be concise and organised using the \nfollowing structure.\nTHE STANDARD REPORTING SYSTEM:\nA statement indicating that the current examination has been compared \nto previous examination(s) should be included (specify date[s]). If this is \nnot included, it should be assumed that no comparison has been made, \nalthough it is preferable to indicate that no comparison was made.\nBelow are the components of standard reporting system:\n1.\t Describe the indication for the study.\n2.\t Describe the breast composition.\n3. Describe any significant finding using standardised terminology.\n4.\t Compare to previous studies.\n5. Conclude to a final assessment category.\nUse BI-RADS categories 0 - 6 and the phrase associated with them.\nIf mammography and US are performed: overall assessment should \nbe based on the most abnormal of the two breasts, based on the \nhighest likelihood of malignancy.\n6.\t Give management recommendations.\n7.

Thus, healthcare providers must recognise and manage \nthe long-term sequelae of the constellation of therapeutic modalities. \nThere is limited evidence for multidisciplinary rehabilitation among \nthese populations. A systematic review concluded that multidisciplinary \nrehabilitation was not harmful and may improve functional ability and \nquality of life in the short-term.1\n•\t Breast cancer-related lymphoedema \nBreast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is a common consequence \nof breast cancer treatment. Patient should be counselled on ways to \nprevent or reduce risk of lymphedema. Weight loss for those who are \noverweight or obese may reduce this risk.2,3 Good evidence showed \nthat there was no increased risk of BRCL with exercise; thus patient \nshould not restrict or avoid physical activity.4 Patients should be \nroutinely examined for clinical symptoms or swelling suggestive of \nlymphoedema. They should be referred to therapists knowledgeable \nabout the diagnosis and treatment of it.\n•\t Physiotherapist plays an important role in the rehabilitation care of \nwomen with breast cancer as well as the care of the survivors.\n•\t Late onset cardiotoxicity\nOccurrence of late onset cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy \nis generally low except for anthracycline especially if dose given is \nabove the limit. If occur, it typically presents as reduced left ventricular \nfunction failure. In contrast, trastuzumab cardiotoxicity usually occur \nduring treatment and does not have risk of delayed cardiotoxicity.5\nIdentification of high-risk patients including patients with pre-existing \nheart problems, cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and treatments like \ntrastuzumab and anthracyclines,6 education of patients on healthy \nlifestyle modifications, aggressive management of underlying CV \nrisk factors, consideration of cardioprotective strategies and, routine \nsurveillance of left ventricular function before and after therapies \nare recommended to reduce breast cancer treatment-associated \ncardiotoxicities.7 Aerobic exercise is considered a promising non-\npharmacological strategy to prevent and/or treat chemotherapy-\ninduced cardiotoxicity.5",
