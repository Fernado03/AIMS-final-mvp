There was active involvement from \na multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nThis is the first edition of an evidence-based CPG on the Management \nof Geriatric Hip Fracture (GHF). Literature search was carried out \nusing the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and \nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed \n(refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The search was \nlimited to literature published on humans, in English and last 15 years. \nIn addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines \nwere searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field \nwere also contacted for studies related to the issues addressed. All \nsearches were conducted from 3 January 2022 to 28 February 2022. \nLiterature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of \nthe CPG development process, allowing any relevant papers published \nbefore 1 July 2023 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search \nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines on GHF as listed below:\n•\t American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons - Management of \nHip Fractures in Older Adults Evidence-Based Clinical Practice \nGuideline (2021)\n•\t National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - Hip fracture: \nManagement (2023) \nA total of five clinical questions were developed under four sections \n(diagnosis, risk factors, treatment and referral/follow-up). Members of \nthe DG were assigned individual questions within the sections (refer to \nAppendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 43 times \nthroughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved \nwere appraised by at least two DG members using Critical Appraisal \nSkill Programme checklist when applicable, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in DG meetings. All statements and \nrecommendations subsequently formulated were agreed upon by both \nthe DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely \non the findings of systematic reviews and clinical trials, with local \npractices taken into consideration.\niv",

            "text": "1\nCPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\n1.\t INTRODUCTION \nA hip fracture is a break in the proximal part of the femur bone and/\nor around the hip joint. In older adults, it usually occurs following low \nenergy trauma. The decline in bone mineral density and increase in \nfrequency of fall among the older adults  are the main reasons for the \nhigh incidence of hip fracture among them.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States of \nAmerica (CDC) states that more than 300,000 people >65 years old are \nhospitalised for hip fractures yearly. More than 95% of these fractures \nare caused by falls and women account for three-quarters of all cases.1\nBased on 2004 - 2006 figures, the residual lifetime risk of hip fracture \n≥50 years of age in Japan was estimated to be 5.6% for men and 20% \nfor women. The highest incidence of hip fractures from Asia had been \nreported from Singapore where the annual rates were 152 in men \nand 402 in women per 100,000 based on 1991 - 1998 data.2, level III In \nMalaysia, a comprehensive study on 56 public and private hospitals \nbetween 1996 to 1997 showed an overall incidence of hip fracture of \n90/100,000 population aged 50 years and above.3, level III  \nIn an annual report by National Orthopedic Registry Malaysia (NORM) \nHip Fracture 2009, analysis on patient above 50 years old with GHF \nrevealed the incidence being highest among those in 70 - 79 years old \nage group which accounted 41.4% of all cases. The incidence was also \nhigher in women than men with the ratio of 2:1. In terms of ethnicity, \nmajority of cases were Chinese (44.5%) followed by Malays (40%) and \nIndians (13.9%).4, level III \nHip fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. \nIndividuals with hip fractures utilise significant healthcare resources \nas their hospital treatments consume large number of inpatient bed-\ndays. Majority of them require surgical fixation and many on discharge \nneed some form of support for daily living.5 - 6, level III Despite constituting \nonly 14% of osteoporosis-related fractures, hip fractures account for \nnearly 75% of the economic burden related to osteoporotic fracture. \nThese fractures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, \nwith one-year mortality after the fracture approaching 30%.7 - 8, level II-2; 9, \nlevel III In a retrospective analysis of patients with hip fractures admitted \nto the Department of Orthopaedics in a Singapore tertiary hospital, \nthe mean cost of hospitalisation was SGD 13,313.81 per patient.10, level III\nIn general, the definitive management for geriatric hip fracture (GHF) \nis surgery. The type of surgery performed depends on type of fracture \nand patient’s pre-morbid functional status.11, level III Elderly patients with \nhip fractures have complex medical, surgical and rehabilitation needs,",

In 2010, only 5% \n(1.43 million) of the population were 65 years and over but by 2040 this \nwill increase to 14.5% (6.02 million).

This review also found \nthat there was no increased risk of death from taking calcium and \nvitamin D.94, level I \n•\t\nPrevention of fall \nCDC reports that >95% of GHF are caused by falls.1 Two guidelines \nrecommend opportunistic screening at least annually on older adults of \ntheir risk of falls during a medical encounter.95 - 96 Three key questions \nhave good sensitivity in screening risk of falls i.e.95\n\t Have you fallen in the past year? \n\t Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? \n\t Do you have worries about falling? \nAll older adults should be advised on falls prevention and physical \nactivity. Individuals at high risk of falls should be offered a comprehensive \nmultifactorial falls risk assessment.95 Refer to Assessment of Falls \nRisk Factors and Interventions to Reduce Identified Risk Factors \nand Algorithm on Risk Stratification, Assessment and Interventions for \nCommunity-Dwelling Older Adults in Appendix 6. \nFor further information on the management of osteoporosis and fall \nprevention, refer to CPG on Management of Osteoporosis (3rd Edition).96\nRecommendation 14\n•\t Geriatric population should be screened and assessed for falls risk. \n\t Education about falls prevention should be offered accordingly.",

FLS identifies patient following a hip fracture, investigates \nthe patient and initiates appropriate treatment to reduce risk of a \nsubsequent fracture. The delivery of the service should also incorporate \nthe integration of primary and secondary/tertiary care. \nA meta-analysis which included 16 RCTs looked into the clinical impact \nof FLS in predicting outcomes for older persons with osteoporotic-\nrelated fractures. The pooled results of the RCTs showed:97, level I \n\t a 23% increase in bone mineral density testing\n\t a 14% increase in initiation of osteoporosis treatment \nAlthough FLS had favourable outcomes in treatment adherence, \nreduced risk of re-fractures and reduced mortality but they were not \nsignificant: \n\t a 22% increase in treatment adherence \n\t a 5% reduction in absolute risk of re-fracture\n\t a 3% reduction in mortality \nMajority of the RCTs in the meta-analysis were considered of high \nquality. \nIn 2021, the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group had strongly \nrecommended a multidisciplinary, coordinator-based FLS as a model \nof care for fracture prevention on patients who have sustained fragility \nfractures.98 \n•\t Fracture Liaison Service has become an important component of \nmanagement in secondary fracture prevention.",

Various factors and \nresource implications should be considered for the success of the \nuptake in the CPG recommendations. \n8.1\t Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are: \ni)\t\navailability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and \nsoftcopies) \nii)\t conferences and updates on or include topics on management of \nGHF including those involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian \nOrthopaedic Association and Malaysian Society of Geriatric \nMedicine) \niii)\t public awareness campaigns on geriatric populations (e.g. \nInternational Day of Older Persons)   \nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include: \ni)\t\ndifferent levels of care and wide variation in practice due to \nexpertise, facilities and financial constraints \nii)\t limited awareness and knowledge in management of GHF among \nhealthcare providers\niii)\t lack of awareness of hip fracture injury and its management by the \npublic\niv)\t lack of resources in maintaining National Orthopaedic Registry \nMalaysia Hip Fracture\n8.2\t Potential Resource Implications \nThe resource implications in the management of GHF falls mainly on \nthe treatment part of the condition. The CPG recommends surgery to \nbe conducted within 48 hours of admission after physical consultation \nby orthopaedic team on medically stable GHF patients. However, this \nmay not be feasible in view of optimisation of patients, availability of \noperating theatre and arrangement to acquire the suitable implant. In \nthe unstable intertrochanteric fracture, CMN has been recommended \nbut cost is the hindering factor in obtaining it. Thus, patient may have to \nopt for less suitable implant which is DHS. \nIn line with the key recommendations in this CPG, the following is \nproposed as clinical audit indicator for quality management of GHF:",
