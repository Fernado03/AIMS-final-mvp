Specific attempts were made to use local data and publications\nto ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not necessarily lead to the best clinical\noutcome in individual patient care. Every healthcare provider is responsible for the management of\nhis/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation and management options available locally.\nREVIEW AND UPDATE OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline was issued in 2020 and will be reviewed in 2025 or earlier if important new evidence\nbecomes available. When they are due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be held on the need for a revision,\nincluding on the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed, and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.\nCPG Secretariat\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia",

            "text": "8\nRationale\nAcute ischaemic stroke continues to be a major cause of morbidity and is currently the third leading\ncause of mortality in Malaysia. With current advancement, timely intervention, and early reperfusion\neither via medical thrombolysis or endovascular treatment, the outcome of stroke has improved\nsignificantly. The biggest challenge in Malaysia is the limited availability, not only in terms of a\ndedicated stroke unit in a major hospital but also the availability of reperfusion therapy, particularly\nmechanical thrombectomy. Furthermore, the lack of community awareness on the importance of\ntimely hyperacute intervention for stroke in Malaysia is still prominent.\nThe 1st Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on the management of ischaemic stroke was published in\n2006 and the second edition was published in 2012. Since then, there was a rapid development in\nthe management of acute stroke, mainly with the improvement and advancement of reperfusion\ntherapy, encompassing both medical thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Furthermore, the\nimportance of timely intervention, especially in the emergency department, had significantly\nimproved the outcome in stroke patients. Therefore, this current CPG emphasizes the hyperacute\nmanagement and has introduced new chapters, for example, emergency medical services. With the\ngrowing numbers of elderly population in Malaysia, we have also included a new chapter on stroke in\nthe older person. This 3rd edition was developed to provide a clear and concise approach based on\ncurrent evidence with the focus being on the efforts to reduce time and improve pre-hospital care.\nWe have summarised and adapted relevant clinical trials data and published literatures to our local\npractice.\nThis CPG has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the Malaysia Stroke Council\n(MSC), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE). The committee\nmembers were multidisciplinary and comprised of neurologists, internal medicine physicians,\ngeriatricians, and emergency physicians from the government sector, private sector, and universities.\nThe external reviewers included were also consultants from multidisciplinary branches of medicine.\nPatient and stroke carer groups were, however, not included as external reviewers.\nObjectives\n\nThese guidelines are intended to provide awareness and education to reduce the morbidity and\nmortality associated with ischaemic stroke by:\n\nIdentifying symptoms and signs of stroke\n\nIdentifying the various types and causes of ischaemic stroke\n\nThese guidelines are intended to provide evidence in:\n\nReducing the total ischaemic time\n\nUpdating the management of ischaemic stroke with respect to:\n\nDiagnosis\n\nHyperacute management\n\nPost hyperacute care\n\nPrimary prevention\n\nSecondary prevention\nThese guidelines however do not cover:\n\nManagement of cerebral haemorrhage\n\nStroke rehabilitation\n\nStroke in the paediatric aged-group population\nRATIONALE, OBJECTIVES AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT",

            "text": "9\nProcess\nThe current CPG is the initiative of the Malaysia Stroke Council of the Malaysia Society of\nNeurosciences. A panel of committee members was appointed comprising of neurologists, internal\nmedicine physicians, geriatricians, and emergency physicians from the Ministry of Health,\nuniversities, and private sector. Authors from the second CPG were invited to contribute on new\nupdates that were discussed by the panel members. The discussion started from early 2018 till 2020\nbefore being finalised and sent to the appointed reviewers. The panel members met several times\nthroughout the development of the guidelines.\nA review of the current medical literature on ischaemic stroke since the publication of the last CPG\non 31st Jan 2012 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases – PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was conducted\nfrom the period of previous CPG publication until 31st July 2020. The relevant MeSH terms or free\ntext terms were used either singly or in combination as the search strategy (refer Appendix A).\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans, and published in the English\nlanguage. The relevant articles were carefully selected from the retrieved list. In addition, the\nreference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies. Local CPGs\nwere also studied. Experts in the relevant field were also contacted to obtain further information.\nInternational guidelines mainly from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association\n(AHA/ASA) and the European Academy of Neurology/European Stroke Organisation (EAN/ESO)\nwere used as the main references.\nAll literature retrieved were appraised and subsequently presented for discussion during the group\nmeetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively by members of\nexpert panels. Whereby the evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were agreed upon by\nconsensus of the panel members. The draft was then sent to local external reviewers for comments.\nThe level of recommendations and the grading of evidence used in this guideline was adapted from\nthe U.S/Canadian Preventative Services Task Force and the Guidelines for Clinical Practice\nGuideline, Ministry of Health Malaysia 2003.\nThe principles and layout follow the methodology stated in the Guidelines for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines booklet published by the Medical Development Division of the Ministry of Health Malaysia.\nThese guidelines have been presented to the Chairman of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA)\nand Clinical Practice Guidelines Council of the Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and approval.\nFormulation Of Recommendation\nIn formulating recommendations for the CPG, evidence from the literature i.e. systematic review,\nmeta-analysis, randomized controlled trial or cohort study were critically appraised using CASP\n(critical appraisal skills program) checklist. Subsequently, the quality of each retrieved evidence and\nits effect size were carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group.\nIn formulating the recommendations, the overall balances of the following aspects were considered\nin determining the strength of the recommendations:\n1. Overall quality of evidence\n2. Balance of benefits versus harms\n3. Values and preferences\n4. Resource implications\n5. Equity, feasibility, and acceptability",

At present medical\nthrombolysis is available at some government hospitals and private healthcare centres while\nmechanical thrombectomy is available likewise in limited centres. Stroke networks are being\nestablished in its early stages in some regions in Malaysia. We hope to have a nationwide stroke\nnetwork in near future.\nThis guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimise the available\nexisting resources for the timely management of patients with ischaemic stroke.\nFacilitators and Barriers:\nThe major barriers for the successful implementation of this CPG is the financial and\nresource implications of:\n\ntransporting\nthese\npatients\nto stroke\nready\nhospitals\nas\nsoon\nas\npossible\nusing\nwell-equipped ambulances and accompanied by trained pre-hospital care personnel or\nmedical officers\n\navailability of medical thrombolysis/mechanical thrombectomy centres providing 24/7\nservice\n\nMedical thrombolysis/mechanical thrombectomy - costs of medications and thrombectomy\ninstruments\nImplementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical governance.\nTo ensure successful implementation of this CPG, we suggest:\n\nIncreasing public awareness of ischaemic stroke in general and educating them on the\nimportance of seeking early medical attention when they developed symptoms suggestive\nof stroke.\n\nContinuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the importance of\ntimely reperfusion and appropriate management of patients with ischaemic stroke. This can\nbe done by roadshows, through the electronic media and in-house training sessions.\nProfessor Dr Hj Hamidon Bin Basri\nChairman",

Global\nstroke estimates study reported that, in 2013, there were approximately 25.7 million stroke survivors,\n6.5 million deaths, 113 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and 10.3 million new cases\nof stroke.1 The high burden of stroke was mainly observed in developing countries, and accounted\nfor 75.2% of all stroke-related deaths and 81% of associated DALYs lost.\nStatistics from the Department of Statistics, Malaysia showed that stroke emerged as one of the top\nfive leading causes of mortality since 2000. Data in 2017 showed that cerebrovascular diseases\ncontributed to 7.1% of all mortalities recorded in the Malaysian population (Table 1.1).\nTable 1.1: Leading Causes of Mortalities in Malaysia\n1.\nIschaemic Heart Disease\n13.9%\n2.\nPneumonia\n12.7%\n3.\nStroke\n7.1%\n4.\nTransport Accidents\n4.6%\n5.\nMalignant Cancer\n2.3%\n(Source: Department of Statistics Malaysia, 2017)\nIschaemic stroke accounted for 79.4% of all stroke cases, followed by haemorrhagic stroke (18.2%),\ntransient ischaemic attack (2%) and unclassified stroke (0.4%).2\nHypertension was the most common risk factor (72%), followed by diabetes mellitus (47%),\ndyslipidaemia (32%) and smoking (31%).3 Hypertension remains the most common medical risk\nfactor for stroke, whereas current smoking and physical inactivity are the most predominant\nlifestyle-related risk factors. In general, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and tobacco smoking tend to\nbe more prevalent among men, whereas hypercholesterolaemia, physical inactivity and obesity were\nmore prevalent among women.4\nThe mean age for ischaemic stroke in Malaysia was 62.8 years for the first stroke and 64.3 years for\nrecurrent cases.2 Malaysian women with a first-ever ischaemic stroke had a greater severity, higher\nnumber of risk factors and poorer functional outcomes, as compared to men. After post gender–age\nadjustment, the Malaysian population observed an increased incidence of stroke in women as\ncompared to men. However, there was no difference between genders in terms of access to\nthrombolysis treatment.5\n1.2 Conceptual Definitions\n1.2.1\nStroke\nStroke is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by rapidly developing clinical symptoms\nand/or signs of focal, and at times global, loss of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting more than\n24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of a vascular origin.\n1",

Subacute (1–3 weeks)\nV.\nChronic (more than 3 weeks)\n1.2.2\nTransient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)\nTIA originally had a time-based definition characterized by an acute loss of focal cerebral or\nmonocular functions with symptoms lasting less than 24 hours and which is thought to be due to\ninadequate cerebral and ocular blood supply as a result of arterial thrombosis or embolism.

The process begins in childhood as fatty streaks and\nprogresses over years with gradual build-up of fibrolipid plaque and infiltration of inflammatory cells.\nThrombosis occurs when this atherosclerotic plaque is disrupted resulting in platelet aggregation.\nAtherothrombosis leads to local arterial occlusion with intraluminal propagation of the thrombus\nproximally or distally or it can result in distal embolism. Intracranial large artery disease is the main\ncause of ischaemic stroke among South Asian patients.3\n2.1.2\nIntracranial Small Vessel Disease\nIntracranial small vessel disease is thought to be due to lipohyalinosis, microatheroma and fibrinoid\nnecrosis.4 The clinical syndrome caused by this phenomenon is lacunar infarction due to occlusion of\nsmall perforating arteries.

The most common causes are atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease.\nRare causes of embolism include air, fat, cholesterol, bacteria, and tumour tissues.9\n2.2 Other Causes\nOther causes include non-atherosclerotic abnormalities of the cerebral vasculature such as arterial\ndissection,\nfibromuscular\ndysplasia,\nvasculitis,\nMoyamoya\ndisease,\nhypercoagulable\nstates,\n2",

Due to\nthe nature of the illness and the dramatic manner in which the neurological deficit occurs, history is of\nutmost importance. Every effort must be made to obtain information from the patient, family members,\nfriends, and witnesses.\nThe diagnosis should provide answers to the following questions:\nI.\nWhat is the neurological deficit?\nII.\nWhere is the lesion(s)?\nIII.\nWhat is the lesion?\nIV. Why has the lesion occurred?\nV.\nWhat are the potential complications and prognosis?\n3.2 Symptoms and Signs\nThe symptoms and signs of stroke depend on the type, location, and the extent of the affected brain\ntissue. Stroke patients usually have a sudden or rapid onset of focal neurological symptoms, within\nminutes to an hour. Some patients may, however, have a stepwise or gradual worsening or waxing\nand waning of symptoms. A third of all strokes occur during sleep at night, therefore, the weakness is\nfirst recognized on waking up in the morning. Diagnosing stroke in the initial hours is very difficult,\nparticularly when the onset is uncertain, the features are atypical or evolving, the patient is unwell or\nagitated, or when access to imaging is delayed, or when brain imaging is normal.1\nA full neurological examination, including documenting the patient’s conscious level and tests of\nhigher mental function (such as the mini-mental state examination) is mandatory. Every positive and\nnegative finding should point to the site of lesion. These can be divided into 2 broad groups: a)\nclinical features that are caused by anterior circulation stroke (carotid artery); and b) those caused by\nposterior circulation stroke (vertebrobasilar system) (see Table 3.1).\nTable 3.1: Clinical Features of Stroke\nAnterior (carotid) artery circulation\nMiddle cerebral artery\n\nAphasia (dominant hemisphere)\n\nHemiparesis / hemiplegia\n\nHemisensory loss / disturbance\n\nHomonymous hemianopia\n\nParietal\nlobe\ndysfunction,\ne.g.\nastereognosis,\nagraphaesthesia,\nimpaired\ntwo-point\ndiscrimination, sensory and visual inattention, left-right dissociation and acalculia\nAnterior cerebral artery\n\nWeakness of lower limbs more than the upper limbs\n3",

Thereafter the risk falls to\nabout 4-5% per year and by 5 years, around 26.4-30% of patients will suffer a recurrent stroke.23-26\nUp to 40% of patients will have a recurrent event at 10 years.25\nThe risk is higher among individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, symptomatic atherosclerotic\ndisease, an active source of thrombosis, or who have discontinued their antiplatelet and\nantihypertensive therapies.27\n4",

Stroke\nis the third cause of mortality and the second leading cause of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY)\nin Malaysia.1 The incidence and prevalence rate for both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke in\nMalaysia had increased steadily from 2010 to 2014.2 Without effective interventions, stroke incidence\nwill continue to rise, thus increasing the healthcare burden.2\nData from the National Stroke Registry showed that first ever strokes contributed to about 79.2% of\nall stroke cases in Malaysia, while 20.8% were due to recurrent strokes.2 Therefore, primary\nprevention is the key to any national strategy to reduce the burden of stroke. Top modifiable risk\nfactors associated with first ever strokes among Malaysians were hypertension (69.9%), diabetes\nmellitus (41.4%), smoking (26.3%), hyperlipidaemia (24.4%), family history of stroke (5.8%),\nischaemic heart disease (IHD) and atrial fibrillation (3.4%). However, geographical and gender\ndifferences are observed.2 Hypertension and diabetes were significantly higher in women compared\nto men, while smoking and IHD were higher in men. Within Peninsular Malaysia, the East Coast had\nthe highest number of hypertensive patients, while the Southern regions had the highest number of\npatients with diabetes. East Malaysia reported the highest number of smokers.3\nThe INTERSTROKE study, which involved 32 countries including Malaysia, identified ten modifiable\nrisk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, waist-hip-ratio, poor diet, smoking, alcohol,\ncardiac cause, apo-lipoprotein levels and psychosocial factors) which accounted for 90% of\npopulation-adjustable risk (PAR) of stroke.4 The Global Burden of Diseases 2013 study identified\nthree clusters of modifiable risk factors associated with highest stroke burden in LMIC5:\nI.\nLifestyle risk factors – smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating (74.1%)\nII.\nMetabolic risk factors – high systolic BP, high cholesterol, high fasting blood glucose, low eGFR\nand high BMI (72%)\nIII.\nEnvironmental - air pollution and lead exposure (33.9%)\nThe National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2011 and 2015 highlighted an alarming trend in the\nprevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among Malaysians, with 63% of Malaysian adults (>18\nyears) having at least one CV risk factor (overweight/obesity, high blood pressure, high blood\nglucose and high blood cholesterol).6,7 Based on NHMS 2015, the prevalence for the three major CV\nrisk factors among Malaysian adults were7:\n\nHypertension (known and undiagnosed) – 30.3%\n\nDiabetes mellitus (known and undiagnosed) - 17.5%\n\nHypercholesterolaemia (known and undiagnosed) – 47.7%\n5",

Stroke risk factors can be\ncategorized into modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Non-modifiable risk factors include age,\nsex, and family history.\nAge: The cumulative effect of aging on the cardiovascular system and the progressive nature of\nstroke risk factors over a prolonged period of time substantially increase stroke risk. The risk of\nstroke doubles in each successive decade after 55 years of age.8,9\nSex: Stroke is more prevalent in men than women.8 Overall, men have higher age-specific stroke\nincidence rates compared to women.10 Exceptions are in the 35 to 44 year-olds and in those over 85\nyears of age, of whom women have slightly greater age-specific incidence than men.10\nCircumstances such as oral contraceptive use and pregnancy uniquely contributes to the risk of\nstroke in women.11-13\nFamily History: Both paternal and maternal history of stroke may be associated with an increased\nrisk. This may be mediated through genetic and shared environmental factors.14,15 Patients with a\nstrong family\nhistory of recurrent subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy should be\ninvestigated for CADASIL, Fabry’s disease or mitochondrial diseases.\n(New recommendation)\n5.2.2\nModifiable Risk Factors\nThe National Stroke Registry has identified the following as the top modifiable risk factors for the\nfirst-ever stroke among Malaysians2:\n\nHypertension\n\nDiabetes mellitus\n\nHypercholesterolaemia\n\nSmoking\n\nIHD\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n5.3 Risk Stratification and Monitoring\n5.3.1\nCardiovascular Risk Estimates\nFor primary prevention strategies to be effective, understanding risk estimates is crucial for both the\npopulation at large and healthcare providers. Individualized risk estimation scores that takes into\naccount both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, validated across multi populations such as\nthe Framingham Stroke Risk Score Calculator, ASCVD and QRISK2 is helpful to create awareness\nand stratifying individuals according to cardiovascular risk categories.16,17 The Revised FSRS is\nshown to be better than the conventional FRS as it adjusts for temporal trends in stroke risk factors\nand has better discriminatory index for detecting stroke in various populations.18 These risk\nestimations allow stratifying of individuals into risk categories for better preventive strategies.\nThe 2017 Malaysian Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Clinical Practice\nGuideline (CPG) has advocated the use of FRS to stratify individuals into low risk, intermediate, high\nand very high risk based on their 10-year risks of developing cardiovascular events.19",

This decision was made during the World Health Organization\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) Steering Committee Meeting in December\n2019 chaired by the Honourable Health Minister of Malaysia.\nThe treatment for smoking should be initiated by the treating doctor based on the assessment and\ntreatment of tobacco use disorder as in Table 1. Details on this can be found in the CPG on\nTreatment of Tobacco Use Disorder 2016, available at:\nhttps://www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/Penerbitan/CPG/Respiratory/CPG_TobacoDisorder.pdf\nTable 5.1: Assessment and treatment of tobacco use disorder\nASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT\n1.\nAsk and document smoking status for all patients.\n2.\nProvide brief advice on quit smoking at every visit to all smokers.\n3.\nAssess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence\nQuestionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using carbon monoxide (CO)\nbreath analyser (IF AVAILABLE).\n4.\nOffer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless contraindicated.\n5.\nIf selected, use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for at least eight to twelve weeks,\nwhereas varenicline should be used for at least twelve weeks.\n6.\nCombination therapy (e.g. two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g. bupropion with an NRT) is better than\nmonotherapy in smoking cessation treatment and may be most useful for those smokers at\nhighest risk of relapse.\n7.\nUse smoking cessation medications with caution in special populations (e.g. children and\nadolescents, pregnant, breastfeeding women, psychiatric and substance abuse disorder\npatients).\n8.\nArrange a minimum of six to eight face to face follow-up sessions for smoking cessation\ninterventions in six months through counselling support team (health education officer,\npharmacists or any officer trained for quit smoking services).\n5.4.4\nAlcohol\nAlcohol consumption has been identified as one of the risk factors for global stroke burden.33 Heavy\nalcohol drinking, of more than 4 units/day (1unit = 1glass wine = 1 pack of hard liquor), increases the\nrisk of stroke.\nRecommendation: Avoid heavy alcohol consumption or limit to < 1 drink per day.\n(New recommendation, Level II-2, Grade B)\n5.4.5\nPost-menopausal Hormone Replacement Therapy\nStroke rates rapidly rise in women once they become menopausal. The Nurses’ Health Study (6-year\nfollow-up of 59,337 postmenopausal women) showed only a weak association between stroke and\noestrogen replacement therapy. However, the Women’s Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin\nStudy (E+P Study) showed a 31% increase in the risk of stroke due to E+ P.34",

The predominant\npathogenic process for stroke associated with cardiac disease is embolism due to formation of\nintra-atrial and intra-ventricular thrombus.\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) whether chronic or paroxysmal, is the most common cause of cardioembolism\nand accounts for 50% of all cardiogenic emboli.

Of the 5 published randomized studies, only 2 were sufficiently powered\nto compare the outcomes between surgery and medical therapy. The absolute 5-year risk reduction\nfor patients with 70-99% carotid artery stenosis (by ultrasound) was 5.4% in the recent follow-up of\nthe ACST trial, which was consistent with the ACAS study from North America (5-year absolute risk\nreduction of 5.9%).99,100 This translates into a 1% annual stroke rate reduction. Patients who are\nasymptomatic and receiving appropriate medical therapy face an annual stroke rate of 2% without\nCEA. Surgical morbidity and mortality often exceed this beneficial risk reduction. In the ACST and\nACAS trials, surgery-related events were 3.1% and 2.3%, respectively.99,100 In an unselected patient\ngroup undergoing CEA in a centre without proper auditing of the surgeon or the centre’s operative\nrecords, the complications are likely to outweigh the benefits of CEA. Furthermore, asymptomatic\npatients should not be offered CEA if their 5-year probability of dying from unrelated causes is high.\nFinally, in the NASCET study, nearly 45% of all strokes occurring in patients with asymptomatic\nstenosis may be attributable to lacunar infarcts or cardioembolism.101\nRecommendation: Endarterectomy may be considered in patients with high-grade asymptomatic\ncarotid stenosis (70-99%) when performed by a surgeon with less than 3% morbidity/ mortality rate.\n(Level I, Grade A)\nCareful patient selection, guided by comorbid conditions, life expectancy, and patient preference,\nfollowed by a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of the procedure is required. It is\nimportant that asymptomatic patients receive appropriate medical treatment and be fully evaluated\nfor other treatable causes of stroke.\n5.8.2\nSecondary Prevention\nTwo large randomized trials (NASCET and ECST) have compared the outcomes of patients with\nrecent cerebrovascular symptoms treated conservatively or with carotid endarterectomy.102,103\nLong-term follow-up and a meta-analysis is available for these trials.104 Standardizing the same\nmeasurements and definitions yielded highly consistent results among the 3 trials. In general, CEA is\nhighly beneficial for patients with carotid stenosis (70-99%), producing a 16% absolute 5-year risk\nreduction (ARR). For patients with 50-69% stenosis, the 5-year ARR was 4.6%. No benefit was\nobserved for patients with milder degrees of stenosis. Subgroup analyses revealed that benefits in\nsurgery was the greatest in men, aged 75 years or older, and those randomized within 2 weeks of\ntheir stroke event. These studies excluded patients with medical co-morbidities, previous neck\nirradiation and recurrent stenosis following previous endarterectomy.",

This chapter will cover the general management of acute stroke that includes\nsupportive care and treatment of acute complications. This is important to improve the mortality rates\nand reduce the functional disability.\n8.1.1\nOxygen and Airway Support\nAdequate tissue oxygenation is imperative to prevent hypoxia and potential worsening of the\nneurological injury.1-5\n(Level II-3 to III)\nRecommendation: Patients with acute stroke should only receive supplemental oxygen if their\noxygen saturation is below 95% and be titrated to achieve above 95%.6-9\n(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade B)\n8.1.2\nObservation\nRecommendation: Regular observation is mandatory to recognise impaired pulmonary function\n(pulse oxymeter), circulatory function (pulse rate, blood pressure), NIHSS score, head chart, GCS,\nand complications from mass effect.1\n(Level III, Grade C)\n8.1.3\nMobilisation\nMost patients are first treated with bed rest, but mobilisation should begin as soon as the patient’s\ncondition is judged to be stable.10-13\nRecommendation: Mobilise early to prevent complications.\n(Level II-3, Grade C)\nAlthough two small RCTs showed that very early mobilisation (beginning within 24 hours) was\nfeasible in an acute setting, the AVERT trial showed that very early, more frequent and higher dose\nof mobilisation focused on out-of-bed activities in addition to usual care was worse in terms of\noutcomes than usual care alone. Very early mobilisation reduced the odds of favourable outcomes at\nthree months.14\nRecommendation: High-dose, very early mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke onset should not be\nrecommended.\n(New recommendation, Level l)\n8.1.4\nBlood Pressure\nIn patients with AIS, early treatment of hypertension is indicated when required by comorbid\nconditions\n(e.g.\nconcomitant\nacute\ncoronary\nevent,\nacute\nheart\nfailure,\naortic\ndissection,\npost-thrombolysis sICH, or preeclampsia/eclampsia).

It might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours\nafter the onset of stroke.15-20\nRecommendation: Lowering BP initially by 15% is probably safe. Very high blood pressure should\nbe reduced gradually.\n(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: Do not treat hypertension if systolic BP is <220mmHg or diastolic BP is\n<120mmHg.

This applies to both diabetics and non-diabetics.22,23\n(Level II-3, Grade C)\nThe International Diabetes Federation published a comprehensive guideline on managing older\npeople with type 2 diabetes which included a section on management of hyperglycaemia post-acute\nstroke.24\nAt present, the optimal level of blood glucose after a stroke is unclear. A systematic review of 11\nRCTs concluded that the administration of intravenous insulin to maintain tight glucose control within\na specific range (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide\nbenefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit, but\nsignificantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes.25\nRecommendation: After an acute stroke, treat hyperglycaemia to keep the blood glucose levels\nbetween 6.0-10.0 mmol/L and ensure that hypoglycaemia is avoided.24\n(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: Avoid very tight targets of glucose control (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours\nof acute ischaemic stroke.\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n8.1.6\nNutrition\nSustaining nutrition is important as malnutrition after stroke might interfere with recovery.26 Persons\nwith infarctions of the brain stem, multiple strokes, large hemispheric lesions, or depressed\nconsciousness are at the greatest risk for aspiration. Swallowing impairments are associated with an\nincreased mortality.\nThe FOOD RCT’s showed that supplemented diet was associated with an absolute reduction in risk\nof death of 0.7% and that early tube feeding (within 7 days of admission) was associated with an\nabsolute reduction in risk of death by 5.8% and a reduction in death or poor outcomes by 1.2%.27,28\nRecommendation: Enteral feeding should be started within 7 days of admission (oral or tube\nfeeding).\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)",

The concept of existence of an ischaemic penumbra is fundamental to the current approach\nin the treatment of ischaemic stroke. Although the core infarcted tissues might not be salvageable,\nadjacent dysfunctional tissue might be saved if the circulation is restored and metabolism is\nnormalized.\nReperfusion therapy is the single most important and beneficial treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.\nIt would be considered unethical if no attempt at reperfusion is made. Reperfusion therapy can be\nachieved via intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or/and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).\nIVT is indicated for patients with onset of symptoms within 4.5 hours of presentation, while EVT for\nlarge vessel occlusion (LVO) could be offered up to 24 hours using advanced imaging such as\nCT/MR perfusion scan. LVO include the ICA andM1 MCA occlusions. It is reasonable to include EVT\nfor ACA, PCA and basilar artery occlusions.1\n(Level I, Grade A)\nStroke treatment protocol and an organized stroke pathway is essential and should be established to\nachieve the recommended response time for IVT and EVT, in order to improve the clinical\noutcomes.1,2 Stroke organizations should incorporate the emergency department (ED) including their\npre-hospital care team, radiology department and stroke team.

As\nthe average age of getting a stroke in Malaysia is 63 years, a significant number of stroke survivors\nare in the older age group.\nOlder persons are heterogenous in nature and their physical and functional status can range from\nvery fit to very severely frail. An older person may also have cognitive function ranging from excellent\nto severe dementia. Older age alone should not be an exclusion criterion for stroke treatment without\nconsidering functional status and medical co-morbidities. This is providing that the older person fulfils\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria for the treatment.\nFrailty is defined as reduced physiological reserve causing a person to be more susceptible to insults.\nA useful scale in determining an older person’s fitness/frailty level is the Clinical Frailty Scale.1 A fit\nolder person’s treatment plan can have goals that approximate those of a younger person. However,\na hallmark of frailty is that the person has reduced tolerance to medical treatment and interventions.\nHence, frail older persons need to be assessed closely for side effects and adverse events from\ntreatment. Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for stroke treatment examine frailty as a factor\nassociated with outcomes. Therefore, the clinician needs to make individualised decisions for\ntreatment based on each older person’s characteristics.\nRecommendation: All older adults should be screened for frailty using a validated instrument\nsuitable for the specific setting or context with a tailored management plan thereafter.2\n(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\n12.2 Treatment of acute stroke\n12.2.1 Stroke Thrombolysis\nThe Cochrane review and meta-analysis shows that older patients benefit at least as much as those\nbelow the age of 80 years, so there is no upper age limit for stroke thrombolysis treatment,\nparticularly within the first 3 hours.3 Patients with mild and severe stroke and those with early signs of\ninfarction on initial brain imaging also benefit from treatment, as long as early radiological changes\nare consistent with the stated time of onset.\nRecommendation: An older person should receive and can benefit from intravenous thrombolysis.\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n12.2.2 Endovascular Thrombectomy\nA meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials with 1287 patients, on endovascular\nthrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel ischaemic stroke versus control, showed that there\nwas benefit across all age-groups in significantly reducing post-stroke dependency at 90 days,\nincluding in those aged 80 years and above.4\nRecommendation: An older person can benefit from endovascular thrombectomy for anterior\ncirculatory large vessel occlusion.\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n12",

A systematic review of 11\nRCTs concluded that administration of intravenous insulin to maintain tight glucose control within a\nspecific range (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide\nbenefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit, but\nsignificantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes.6\nRecommendation: After an acute stroke, treat hyperglycaemia to keep the blood glucose levels\nbetween 6.0-10.0 mmol/L (110-180 mg/dL) and ensure that hypoglycaemia is avoided.5\n(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: Avoid very tight targets of glucose control (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours\nof acute ischaemic stroke.\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n12.3 Management of risk factors for stroke prevention\n12.3.1 Hypertension\nOlder persons may develop orthostatic hypotension, have falls and syncope when prescribed with\nmultiple\nantihypertensive\nmedications.\nHome\nBP\nmonitoring\nmay\nsupplement\nclinic\nBP\nmeasurements for a more reflective picture of the overall BP control.\nOlder persons with high frailty levels, advanced cognitive impairment, or terminal illness, requires\naccurate prognostication, risk stratification and setting of treatment goals. These population groups\nare not represented in large RCTs and therefore have no demonstrated safety data for intensive BP\nlowering.7\nRecommendation: Older persons who have one or more of the following: frailty, multiple\ncomorbidities, cognitive impairment, require an individualised approach for blood pressure\nmanagement.\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n12.3.2 Diabetes Mellitus\nIn older people, therapeutic decisions on blood glucose control should be based on comprehensive\nassessment and individualized risk stratification of key risk factors.

A higher\npercentage of older persons have impaired renal function, low body weight and sarcopenia.\nPrescribing a DOAC without following the prescription guidelines results in a higher number of\nstrokes and adverse events.12\nFalls and dementia are not absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, the decision needs to be\nmade on an individualised basis. Falls prevention measures and carer education are important in\nthese circumstances.\nThe 2019 Beers criteria recommend that rivaroxaban and dabigatran are prescribed with caution in\nolder persons aged 75 years and above due to the higher risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.13\nThe OAC-FORTA (Oral Anticoagulant – Fit for the Aged) guidelines recommend apixaban as\nFORTA-A (highly beneficial) in older persons and the other DOACs and warfarin as FORTA-B\n(beneficial).11\nRecommendation: Older persons with atrial fibrillation can benefit from oral anticoagulant for stroke\nprevention with an individualised treatment plan taking medical co-morbidities, functional status, and\nsocial factors into consideration.\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n12.4 Medication management in the older person with stroke\nOlder persons, especially those who had a stroke and several stroke risk factors, are more likely to\nexperience polypharmacy (≥5 medications) with high pill burden, adverse events from medications,\ndrug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and the high cost of treatment.\nWhen prescribing for an older person, it is advisable to\n- simplify the medication regime\n- choose where possible, medications that require once a day administration\n- consider renal and liver function, and presence of anaemia\n- consider swallowing function\n- check the body weight\n- deprescribe or reduce dosages or number of medications by prioritising medical conditions,\nreviewing targets of treatment and side effects\n- check for potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions",

This chapter will cover the aetiology and risk factors in young adults with stroke, in\naddition to the diagnosis and management of specific causes of stroke in young adults.\n14.2\nYoung Stroke Aetiology\nThe causes of ischaemic stroke in young adults are diverse and vary by age, gender, and\ngeographic region.4 The causes may be classified according to the TOAST classification.\nNon-atherosclerotic arteriopathies such as arterial dissection as well as premature atherosclerosis\ndue to hypertension, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidaemia are collectively the most common\ncauses of ischaemic stroke in young individuals.3,5 But often, the cause of the stroke is unknown.6\nCryptogenic stroke is defined as stroke without any probable cause identified after adequate\ndiagnostic evaluation.7-10 Cryptogenic stroke has been reported in up to 40% of young stroke cases.4\nIn 2014, the clinical construct of “embolic stroke of undetermined source” (ESUS) was introduced to\nidentify patients with non-lacunar cryptogenic ischaemic strokes in whom embolism was the likely\nstroke mechanism. About 1/6 of stroke patients are labelled as ESUS and they are generally younger\npatients with milder stroke but are associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence.7,8 To date, there\nis no evidence to suggest the role of anticoagulants in the management of ESUS.\nTable 14.1: Aetiology of Young Stroke\nLarge artery atherosclerosis\n\nUncommon before the age of 40 but incidence increases with age\n\nClassic vascular risk factors are present\n\nManagement is similar with stroke in older populations\nCardiogenic embolism\n\nCardiac tumours commonly found in the left atrium and apex (atrial myxoma, papillary\nfibroelastoma)\n\nArrhythmia – atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, etc.\n\nCardiomyopathy\n\nInfection and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis\n\nRheumatic valvular heart disease9\n\nPatent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect (ASD), etc.\nSmall vessel disease\n\nGenetic: cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and\nleukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) -Notch 3 mutation11\n\nSporadic: classic vascular risk factors are present\n\nManagement is long-term antiplatelet therapy\n14",

Although yet to be\nproven effective, they may be considered for treatment in acute stroke (Table 16.1).\nTable 16.1: Stroke Therapy Modalities\nTherapy\nDescription\nNeuroAid\nThe medicine did not demonstrate any statistically significant benefit after 3\nmonths although some small studies showed that it could be effective in\nimproving functional independence and motor recovery, and is safe for\npatients with a primarily non-acute stable stroke.1-3\nCiticoline\nCiticoline is widely used after stroke but is not proven statistically to be\nbeneficial in the treatment of acute stroke.4,5\nCerebrolysin\nCerebrolysin is also not proven in the management of acute stroke.6-8\nEdaravone\nMeta-analysis of Edavarone showed some benefits in improving neurological\nimpairment in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage but was\nnot proven to reduce death and long-term disability in both types of stroke.9\nGingko\nThere was limited evidence on to support the use of gingko biloba in terms of\nimproving quality of life and other stroke events. As such, more studies are\nneeded before it can be recommended for routine use in improving\nneurological and cognitive function in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.10\nVitamin B\nBased on the Vitatops trial, Vitamin B supplements did not help in secondary\nstroke prevention but showed some benefit if the patient had concomitant\nhyperhomocysteinaemia.11,12\nFolic Acid\nFolic acid supplementation did not demonstrate a major effect in preventing\nstroke. However, potential mild benefits in primary stroke prevention,\nespecially when folate is combined with B vitamins and in male patients,\nrequires further investigation.13\nSelective\nSerotonin\nReuptake\nInhibitors\nFluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to\nimprove the functional outcomes. A study showed that even though the\ntreatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of\nbone fractures. Therefore, recent evidence does not support the routine use\nof fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to\npromote recovery of function.14\nAcupuncture\nAcupuncture, from multiple trials, did not show any significant benefit and\nefficacy in terms of functional recovery after stroke.15-17 A recent\nmeta-analysis concluded that the apparent reduction in dependency and\nimprovement in neurological recovery associated with the use of acupuncture\nin acute stroke are confounded by the use of open controls .However the\nadverse events associated with acupuncture were generally reported to be\nminor and usually did not result in stopping treatment.18\nTranscranial\nMagnetic\nStimulation (TMS)\nTMS has shown some promising results in improving the motor recovery after\nstroke. However, it may need more evidence before it can be used as a daily\nrehabilitation tool for r stroke.19-22\nTocovid\n(Tocotrienol)\nTocovid (tocotrienol) has only been proven in animal studies to be effective as\nneuroprotective treatment in stroke, but not in human studies.23-25 However,\none study showed that tocotrienol may attenuate the progression of white\nmatter lesion26.\nSelenium\nSelenium levels have been shown to be on the lower side during an acute\nstroke. However, there is still no evidence of benefit from Selenium\n16",
