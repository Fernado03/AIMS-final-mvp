This \nincludes benefits and side effects of treatment, proper instillation \ntechnique of eye drop and compliance to treatment.\nRecommendation 5\n•\t Laser iridotomy should be performed in primary angle closure \ndisease when indicated.\n•\t Peripheral iridoplasty may be considered for initial treatment in acute \nangle closure.\nRecommendation 6\n•\t Intraoperative Mitomycin C during trabeculectomy should be used in \nglaucoma patients at risk of surgical failure.\nRecommendation 7\n•\t Glaucoma patients with blindness or low vision should be referred \nfor vision rehabilitation which includes vocational, occupational and \nindependent living.\nii",

There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nThe CPG update was done based on the CPG Management of Primary \nOpen Angle Glaucoma, issued in 2008. In the update, the scope had \nbeen widened to include both primary open angle and angle closure \nglaucoma, and also selected conditions. A literature search was carried \nout using the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid \nand Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Embase, \nPubmed and Guidelines International Network (refer to Appendix 1 \nfor Example of Search Strategy). The search was limited to literature \npublished in the last ten years, on humans and in English. In addition, the \nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to \nfurther identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted \nto identify further studies. All searches were conducted from 23 March \n2015 to 29 July 2015. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31 January 2017 to be included. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on glaucoma such \nas Glaucoma: Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Open Angle \nGlaucoma and Ocular Hypertension (National Collaborating Centre for \nAcute Care, 2009), Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP (American \nAcademy of Ophthalmology, 2015), Terminology and Guidelines for \nGlaucoma 4th Edition (European Glaucoma Society, 2014) and Asia \nPacific Glaucoma Guidelines Third Edition (Asian Pacific Glaucoma \nSociety, 2016). The CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of \nGuidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being \nused as references.\nA total of 16 clinical questions were developed under different sections. \nMembers of the DG were assigned individual questions within these \nsections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG \nmembers met 25 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings.

Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely \non the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, \nwith local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of \nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows \nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external \nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for \nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented \nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and \nCPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

It \nis the second leading cause of blindness worldwide.1 Individuals \nwith glaucoma are often asymptomatic and present at a late stage. \nBlindness from glaucoma is preventable if treatment is instituted early. \nThe number of persons estimated to be blind as a result of primary \nglaucoma is 4.5 million, accounting for slightly more than 12% of all \nglobal blindness.2 In Malaysia, the 2014 National Eye Survey II showed \nan estimated prevalence of blindness in those aged 50 and above was \nat 1.2% [presenting visual acuity (VA) <3/60 in the better eye] of which \n6.6% was caused by glaucoma.3\nAs with any other chronic diseases, the management of glaucoma \nmay be a burden on the economy. The direct and indirect economic \nimpact of glaucoma on the population has been studied. The direct \ncost estimates for approximately two million citizens of United States of \nAmerica and 300,000 citizens of Australia with glaucoma are USD2.99 \nbillion4 and AUD144.2 million5 respectively. However, the true cost is \nprobably higher as about half of the patients with glaucoma are unaware \nthey have the disease.6 - 9 \nResource use and direct cost of glaucoma management increase \nwith worsening disease. The average direct cost of treatment ranges \nfrom USD623 per patient/year for glaucoma suspects or patients with \nearly stage disease to USD2511 per patient/year for patients with end-\nstage disease. Medication costs composed the largest proportion of \ntotal direct cost for all stages of disease (24 - 61%).10 A similar trend \nis seen in Europe where resource utilisation and direct medical costs \nof glaucoma management increase with worsening disease severity. \nThe direct cost of treatment is increased by an estimated €86 for each \nincremental step ranging from €455 per patient/year for stage 0 to €969 \nper patient/year for stage IV disease. Medication costs range from 42% \nto 56% of total direct cost for all stages of disease.11 \nIn East Asia, primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is an important \ncause of blindness. The cost of managing acute PACG in Singapore, \nwhich affects 12.2 per 100,000/year in those aged 30 and older is \nestimated annually to be USD261,742.12 \nThe first edition of the Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) published in \n2008 was confined to POAG. Many new developments have emerged \nwhich led to variation in clinical practice. Based on this, the CPG has \nbeen updated and the scope widened to include PACG and special \nconditions. It aims to guide healthcare providers on evidence-based \nmanagement of glaucoma in the Malaysian healthcare setting.",
