Clinical audit indicators have also been identified for the purpose of\nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes.\n\nEvidence was retrieved from publications from the 1972 onwards. Literature search\nwas carried out using the following electronic databases: PUBMED/MEDLINE;\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); Health Technology Assessment\n(HTA) and full text journal articles via OVID search engine. In addition, the\nreference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further\nstudies. The search process was conducted between May 2012 and May 2013,\nand only literatures in English were included,\n\nAll articles retrieved were appraised by at least two members and graded\naccording to the levels of evidence presented in the form of evidence tables and\ndiscussed during group meetings. The levels of evidence table were adopted from\nthe modified version of the United States (U.S) / Canadian Preventive Services Task\nForce, while the grading of recommendations was based on the modified version\nof the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). The CPG was based\non the findings of relevant published evidence.\n\nThe draft was reviewed by a team of internal / external reviewers and was\navailable on the websites of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia and Academy of\nMedicine, Malaysia for comments and feedback, Recommendations were\npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, and finally to the\nHealth Technology Assessment and CPG Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for\napproval.",

AETIOLOGY\n\nItis generally agreed that ameloblastoma arise from remnants of odontogenic\nepithelium that failed to regress during embryonic development. They may\narise from rests of dental lamina, epithelial rest cell of Malassez or enamel\nforming organ. If these cell rests are situated outside the bone in the soft\ntissues of gingival and edentulous alveolar mucosa, they may give rise to\nperipheral ameloblastoma. It is also agreed that solid multicystic ameloblastoma\nmay arise as a result of neoplastic changes in the lining or wall of a\nnon-neoplastic odontogenic cyst, in particular dentigerous and odontogenic\nkeratocysts, level M10 tve is\n\n3.
