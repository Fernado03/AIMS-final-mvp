Untreated, it is a \npotentially devastating disease. However, the past decade has seen remarkable \nimprovements in our understanding of the pathology associated with the \ncondition and the development of PAH-specific therapies with the ability to \nalter the natural history of the disease. Indeed, the diagnosis, assessment \nand treatment of PAH is a rapidly evolving area, with changes occurring in the \ndefinition of the disease, screening and diagnostic techniques, staging and \nfollow-up assessment, and a growing armamentarium of PAH-specific therapies. \nThese new advances provide a significant opportunity for practitioners to detect \nand treat patients with PAH in a timely and effective manner, thereby improving \noverall mortality, morbidity, and quality of life associated with this disease. Our \nintention is to provide clear and concise descriptions of the new pathological \nclassification and of the recent pathogenetic insights. The diagnostic process \nwill be discussed in order to propose a logical sequence of investigations for \naetiology identification, disease assessment and follow-up. Special emphasis \nwill be devoted to an evidence-based treatment algorithm that is unique to \nMalaysia, yet in-line with internationally accepted guidelines.\nDr Ashari Bin Yunus\nConsultant Respiratory Physician\nChairperson, Guidelines Development Group",

The group members met a total of 20 times throughout the \ndevelopment of the guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by \nat least two members and presented in the form of evidence tables and \ndiscussed during group meetings.

Introduction\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases that affect the \nsmall pulmonary arteries, and which form a subset of those with pulmonary \nhypertension (PHT). PAH can be idiopathic, heritable, or associated with a \nnumber of conditions, such as connective tissue disease (CTD); congenital \nheart disease (CHD); portal hypertension; HIV infection, and exposure to \ntoxins and drugs, including appetite suppressants. All of these conditions are \ncharacterised by sustained elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), \nincreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with progression to right-sided \nheart failure and ultimately death.1 Mortality rates in patients with PAH are \nhigh: historically, the median life expectancy of idiopathic PAH (IPAH) without \nspecific therapy is 2.8 years from diagnosis, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year \nsurvival rates of 68%, 48% and 34%, respectively.2 In addition, most patients \nwith PAH have a compromised quality of life (QoL) with limited physical activity \nand social function.3\nWith our rapidly evolving knowledge of PAH, a number of drug classes have \nbeen approved based on positive results from randomised clinical trials (RCTs), \nnamely prostanoids i.e. epoprostenol, iloprost, beraprost and treprostinil; \nphosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors(PDE-5) i.e. sildenafil and tadalafil; and \nendothelin (ET)-receptor antagonists (ERA) i.e. bosentan and ambrisentan. All \nof these drugs have the ability to significantly alter the natural course of the \ndisease. However, not all these PAH-specific therapies are available in Malaysia, \nwith patient’s access to these drugs limited by cost. \nThese guidelines aim to highlight the challenges of diagnosing and managing \nPAH within the context of the Malaysian health care system. From a local \nperspective, this information may be more clinically useful, and provide a more \naccurate clinical hierarchy to guide treatment selection based on the weight of \navailable evidence. It is hoped that these guidelines will provide a significant \nopportunity for practitioners to detect and treat patients with PAH in a timely \nand effective manner, thereby improving overall mortality, morbidity, and QoL.",

Clinical classification\nThe classification of PHT has undergone a series of changes since the first criteria \nwere proposed in 1973. Until recently, PHT was defined by a mean PAP (mPAP) \n>25 mmHg at rest or >30 mmHg with exercise. However, this classification was \nrecently updated at the 4th World Symposium on PHT, which took place in \nDana Point, California, in early 2008.4 PHT is now defined simply as a resting \nmPAP>25 mmHg, thereby eliminating the diagnostic criteria associated with \nexercise. The new Dana Point definition also suggests that a resting mPAP of 8 \nto 20 mmHg should be considered as normal.4\nPHT is classified into five categories based in part on aetiology: PAH, PHT owing \nto left heart disease, PHT associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia, PHT \nresulting from chronic thrombotic or embolic disease, and PHT with unclear \nmulti-factorial mechanisms (Table 1).4 The classification system aims to frame \nwhether PHT is a manifestation of an underlying disease and provides an \nunderstanding of the context in which PHT occurs. PAH, a sub-category of PHT \n(the two terms are not synonymous), is defined as a mPAP >25 mmHg at rest \nwith a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP, ≤15 mmHg) and \nexcluding pulmonary venous hypertension.4-7",

A modified version of the New York Heart Association \n(NYHA) functional class was adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) \nin 1998 to facilitate the evaluation of patients with PAH (Table 2).8 Functional \nclass assessments are an important prognostic tool for clinicians.2, 9, 10 However, \nthe WHO classification system is based almost entirely on symptoms, and it is \nworth noting that wide variations in clinicians’ assessment of PAH can occur.11\nTable 2: WHO classification of functional status in patients with PHT \nmodified from New York Heart Association classification\nClass I\nPatients with PHT but without resulting limitation of physical \nactivity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue \ndyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.\nClass II\nPatients with PHT resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. \nThey are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes \nundue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.\nClass III\nPatients with PHT resulting in marked limitation of physical \nactivity. They are comfortable at rest. Less-than-ordinary physical \nactivity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near \nsyncope.\nClass IV\nPatients with PHT with inability to carry out any physical activity \nwithout symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart \nfailure. Dyspnoea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. \nDiscomfort is increased by any physical activity.\n3. Pathogenesis\nUnder normal conditions, the pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure (mPAP \n12-16 mmHg), high-capacity circuit. Healthy individuals can accommodate up \nto a four-fold rise from the resting cardiac output with little increase in PAP, due \nto distensibility of the thin-walled pulmonary vasculature and to recruitment of \nvessels that are normally closed when at rest.12 The excess capacity is such that \napproximately 70% of the vascular bed must be lost before there is an increase \nin resting PAP.12\nMost forms of PAH share a common pathophysiology which includes \npulmonary vasoconstriction, remodeling of the pulmonary vessel wall",

One \nmechanism is believed to involve endothelial dysfunction, resulting in over \nexpression of ET-1.16 Endothelial dysfunction also reduces the synthesis of nitric \noxide and prostacyclin (PgI2), along with over-expression of vasconstrictors \nsuch as thromboxane A2 (TxA2).17, 18 These factors work in concert, impairing \nvasodilatory responses and exacerbating the dysfunctional vasoresponses \ncaused by elevated ET levels.15, 17-19 Other important pathways in the process \nof pulmonary vascular remodeling include changes in potassium channel \nexpression, activation of vascular elastases, and increased expression of \ninflammatory chemokines.20 Various growth and transcription factors have also \nbeen postulated to be involved. These including serotonin21, platelet-derived \ngrowth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin growth factor-1 \n(IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 \nalpha) and nuclear factor activating T lymphocytes (NFAT).22, 23\nGenetic factors play an important role in the development of PAH. Mutation \nof the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type II (BMPR2) gene has been \nidentified in approximately 70% of patients with familial PAH and 25% or less \nof individuals with IPAH without family history.24 However, the relationship of \nthis gene mutation to the broad range of associated causes of PAH remains \nunknown, and not all individuals carrying the BMPR2 mutation develop PAH. A \nsubject who possesses the mutation has a 10% to 20% lifetime risk of acquiring \nPAH, while an individual without the mutation has a lifetime risk of PAH no \ndifferent to the general population.25\nDespite the multitude of perturbations that have been demonstrated in clinical \nPAH as well as in animal models of PHT, it remains unclear which are ‘causes’ \nversus consequences of this disorder. Regardless, the end result includes \nincreased vasoconstriction, smooth muscle cell proliferation, decreased \nvasodilation, and fibrotic changes in medium- to small-sized pulmonary \narteries.13-15 Both vasoconstrictive and hypertrophic changes lead to increased \nPVR, increasing the workload of the right ventricle. Initially, the right ventricle \ncompensates to maintain adequate pulmonary flow, but as the increased \nworkload causes the right ventricle to dilate, and eventually fails. Symptoms \nsuch as dyspnoea and fatigue appear, initially on exertion. Eventually and often \nsuddenly, the right ventricle decompensates and right heart failure ensues.26 \nDeath occurs as a result of end-stage right heart failure or arrhythmia.27",

Epidemiology and natural history\nIn 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institute \nof Health (NIH) created a national registry of patients with PAH.28 From this \nstudy it was concluded that the incidence of primary PAH (now referred to \nas IPAH) was 1-2 cases per million population. In the following 25 years, our \nunderstanding of PAH has significantly improved and more recent estimates of \nPAH in the general community vary from 5 to 52 cases per million population.29, \n30 Furthermore, it is now recognised that IPAH may manifest in both genders \nand all ages. During childhood, the condition affects both genders equally.1 \nAfter puberty however, detection is more frequent in females (approximately \n2:1 ratio).31, 32\nFor secondary causes, PAH is associated with scleroderma in 4.9% to 38.6% of \npatients33-37, a condition which itself, has a point prevalence of between 30.8 \nand 286 cases per million population.27\nThe prevalence of PAH within Asian communities has not been specifically \naddressed. However, it is likely that more patients will come to the attention of \nclinicians as a result of awareness and greater access to medical care.\nThe natural history of IPAH has been well documented.2 Survival for patients \nwith PAH associated with the scleroderma spectrum of diseases appears to \nbe worse than for IPAH, and the untreated 2-year survival rate may be as low \nas 40%.38 With the advent of PAH-specific therapy, more recent registry data \nindicate that the one year mortality rates in patient with IPAH and connective \ntissue disease associated PAH (CTD-PAH) have dropped to approximately 12% \n- 15%.29, 39, 40\nPredictors of poor prognosis include advanced functional class (IV)2, 9, 10 and poor \nexercise capacity (<300m) as measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT).10, \n41, 42 Several investigators have demonstrated the important prognostic \nvalue of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics on survival, namely mPAP, mRAP \n(>20 mmHg) and CI (<2.0 L/min/m2).2, 9, 10 Significant right ventricular (RV) \ndysfunction43, 44 and elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)45 also \nappear to be independent predictors of survival.",

Screening\nThe availability of new therapies that have been shown to slow or prevent \nprogression of PAH has caused a growing interest among physicians to diagnose \nPAH at an early stage. High risk conditions are shown in Table 3. The American \nCollege of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Consensus Statement recommends periodic \nDoppler echocardiography as part of a screening programme in patients with \nscleroderma because of the relatively high detection rates in this cohort.25 \nPatients with more than one family member with PAH related to a mutation in \nthe BMPR2 might be considered for genetic testing, since a negative test would \nimply that there is no higher than normal risk of developing PAH.

Physical examination\nThe likelihood of PAH is increased when certain findings are present on physical \nexamination. Notable findings include, a left parasternal heave produced by \nthe impulse of the hypertrophied right ventricle, an accentuated pulmonary \ncomponent of the second heart sound (S2), pansystolic murmur of tricuspid \nregurgitation, diastolic murmur of pulmonary insufficiency, right ventricular \nS3, jugular vein distention, hepatomegaly, peripheral oedema, ascites and cool \nextremities.25, 48 However, the absence of these findings does not exclude PAH.\nPAH may also be associated with a variety of comorbid conditions. Therefore, \npast medical history and symptomatic evidence of a related illness should be \nconsidered. Potential exposure to toxic agents should be explored, including \nprevious use of appetite suppressants and chemotherapy agents (e.g., \nmitomycin-C, carmustine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and bleomycin). \nKnown exposure to HIV infection, and a history of pulmonary embolism or \ndeep vein thrombosis should also be considered.26 Orthopnea and paroxysmal \nnocturnal dyspnea suggest elevated pulmonary venous pressure and pulmonary \ncongestion due to left-sided cardiac disease. Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgias, \nor swollen hands and other symptoms of CTD in the setting of dyspnoea should \nraise the possibility of PAH related to CTD.

ECG\nECG changes associated with PAH include right ventricular hypertrophy and \nright axis deviation in 87% and 79% of patients, respectively.25, 48  The ECG lacks \nsufficient sensitivity to serve as an effective screening tool for PAH, and it is \nimportant to note that a normal ECG does not exclude the presence of severe \nPHT. \n6.2.2. CXR\nIn the majority of patients with mild PAH, a CXR is normal. In more advanced \ndisease, signs suggestive of PAH include enlarged main and hilar pulmonary \narterial shadows with concomitant attenuation of peripheral pulmonary \nvascular markings (‘pruning’). Right ventricular enlargement is often detected \nby impingement of the anteriorly situated right ventricle silhouette into the \nretrosternal clear space on the lateral CXR.25, 48\n6.2.3. Transthoracic Doppler Echocardiography\nDoppler echocardiography is the most useful non-invasive tool and should be \nemployed in patients with suspected PHT to assess pulmonary artery systolic \npressure (PASP), right ventricular enlargement (RVE), right atrial enlargement \n(RAE) and RV dysfunction.25, 48 An adequate Doppler signal from the \ntricuspid regurgitation jet is required to estimate PASP and can be obtained \nin approximately 75% of patients.5 PASP is equivalent to right ventricular \nsystolic pressure (RVSP) in the absence of pulmonary outflow obstruction. \nRVSP is estimated by measurement of the systolic regurgitant tricuspid flow \nvelocity v(m/s) and an estimate of RAP applied in the formula: RVSP = 4v2 + RAP \n(mmHg). The new DanaPoint guidelines recognise that PASPs are dependant \non age, gender and body mass index. In general, however, a tricuspid flow \nvelocity >2.8 m/s and a tricuspid insufficiency peak gradient ≥31 mmHg at \nrest are considered suggestive of PHT.50 It should be noted that, using this \ndefinition, a number of false positive diagnoses can be anticipated especially in \naged subjects and confirmation with RHC is required in symptomatic patients.\nTo exclude PHT due to left-heart disease, left ventricular systolic and diastolic \nfunction, and valve morphology and function should also be assessed. Finally, \nechocardiography with contrast should be used to identify or rule out PAH due \nto CHD (e.g., abnormal morphology; shunt).",

PHT clinical class identification\nOnce PHT is detected, identification of associated aetiology by major classes \n(Table 1)4 is required. This will be guided by clinical circumstances and may \ninclude pulmonary function tests (PFTs), ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) lung \nscanning, in addition to the Doppler echocardiography measures outlined \nabove. Additional tests, such as high resolution CT, spiral CT and pulmonary \nangiography may also be required. (Table 4)\n6.3.1. PFTs\nAlthough lung function abnormalities have been described in association with \nPAH they are generally mild and unlikely to be the primary cause of symptoms. \nPFTs are therefore used to exclude significant lung disease. The exception is \na marked impairment in DLCO associated with systemic sclerosis. The DLCO of \n20% of patients with limited systemic sclerosis is below normal; however, a \nDLCO of <55% of predicted increases the likelihood of the presence or future \ndevelopment of PAH.25, 48\n6.3.2.

In three studies, V/Q scanning showed \nsensitivity of 90% to 100% with a specificity of 94% to 100% for distinguishing \nbetween IPAH and CTEPH.

Blood tests, exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary \nhaemodynamics are commonly assessed.\n6.4.1.

A summary of patient characteristics and results from RCTs with bosentan \nversus placebo is presented in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2.\nLong-term administration of bosentan has also been shown to deliver \nfavourable results. In 2005, McLaughlin et al., published survival data from an \nopen-label extension study of patients involved in the pivotal bosentan clinical \ntrials.80 The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 2-years was 89%. Similarly, \nProvencher et al., published a retrospective analysis of 103 PAH patients \ntreated with bosentan and followed over 24  15 months.81 One, 2- and 3-year \nestimates of survival were 92%, 89% and 79%, respectively. More recently, a \nprospective, multicentre, Australian registry enrolled 528 patients between \n2004 and 2007.39 All patients were initiated on first-line bosentan.

Ambrisentan (Level of evidence B)\nAmbrisentan is a selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist and has been \napproved for the treatment of WHO-FC II and III patients with PAH. A pilot \nstudy and two large RCTs (ARIES 1 and 2) have demonstrated efficacy on \nsymptoms, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening \nof patients with IPAH and PAH associated with CTD and HIV infection.82-84 The \ncurrent approved dose is 5mg daily which can be increased to 10mg daily if \ntolerated. The incidence of abnormal liver function tests ranges from 0.8 to \n3%. In a small group of patients who were intolerant to either bosentan due \nto liver function test abnormalities, ambrisentan at a dose of 5mg was well \ntolerated. However, patients treated with ambrisentan require regular liver \nfunction testing. Ambrisentan has been associated with increased incidence of \nperipheral oedema.\n7.2.3. Iloprost (Level of evidence B)\nIloprost is a prostacyclin derivative and was approved by US Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for WHO functional class III and IV PAH. \nProstacyclin is a metabolite of arachidonic acid produced primarily in vascular \nendothelium. It is a potent vasodilator, affecting both the pulmonary and \nsystemic circulation. There is evidence to suggest that a relative deficiency \nof prostacyclin may contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH.18Although other \nprostanoids have been developed (e.g. epoprostenol and beraprost), iloprost is \ncurrently the only commercially available agent in Malaysia.\nIloprost is administered via an ultrasonic nebuliser with a half-life of 20 to \n25 minutes. Therefore, chronic use requires six to nine inhalations a day to \nobtain a sustained clinical benefit.85The recommended inhaled dose is 2.5-5 \nug/inhalation. Common side effects include cough, headache, flushing and jaw \npain. \nAt the time of writing, short-term data for inhaled iloprost as monotherapy \nwas available from one RCT that enrolled patients with both PAH and CTEPH.86 \nOverall, this study showed an increase in exercise capacity, an improvement in \nPVR, and a reduction in clinical events for patients receiving iloprost.  However, \nother haemodynamic measures were not affected. In a study of 24 iloprost-\ntreated IPAH patients, Hoeper et al.,87 reported sustained benefits in exercise \ncapacity and haemodynamics at 1 year. More recently, Opitz et al.,88 reported \nevent-free (death, transplantation, switch to i.v. therapy, or addition of other \nactive oral therapy) survival rates of 53%, 29%, and 20% at 1-, 2-, and 3-years,",

Patient characteristics and \nresults from these studies are presented in Appendix 5 and Appendix 6. \n7.2.4. Sildenafil (Level of evidence A)\nSildenafil is an oral PDE-5 inhibitor. PDE-5 exerts its pharmacological effect by \nincreasing the activity of endogenous nitric oxide, thereby inducing relaxation \nand anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells.5Early clinical \nstudies with sildenafil in patients with PAH have demonstrated its ability to \nreduce mPAP and PVR, and to produce an increase in cardiac index.89\nThree RCTs with sildenafil as monotherapy versus placebo have been performed \nin patients with PAH.90-92In these trials, the dose of sildenafil ranged from \n60 to 240mg/day. In the largest RCT performed by Galie et al.,91278 patients \nwere randomised to receive placebo or sildenafil (20, 40 mg or 80 mg) orally \nthree-times daily for a period of 12 weeks. A significant increase in 6MWD was \nobserved in all three sildenafil groups compared to placebo but there was no \nsignificant difference in effect between sildenafil doses. However, patients \nrandomised to a higher dose of sildenafil demonstrated greater improvements \nin mPAP, CI, PVR and functional class. Results from RCTs performed with \nsildenafil are presented in Appendix 7 and Appendix 8. \nAt the time of writing, only one study has reported long-term efficacy with \nchronic administration of sildenafil.91 In that study, all data was based on a dose \nof 80 mg three-times daily and a one-year survival rate of 96% was observed \n(Appendix 9). The most common side effects include headache, flushing, \ndyspepsia, epistaxis, nasal congestion and impaired vision.\nThe FDA-approved dose of sildenafil in patients with PAH is 20 mg tds \nadministered orally. However, higher doses, up to 80 mg tds, may be more \nefficacious.\n7.2.5 Tadalafil (Level of evidence B)\nTadalafil is a long actingPDE-5 inhibitor. An RCT (PHIRST) on 406 PAH patients \n(about half on background bosentan therapy) treated with tadalafil has shown \nfavourable results on exercise capacity, symptoms, haemodynamics, and time \nto clinical worsening at the 40 mg daily dose.93 The side effects are similar to \nthat of sildenafil.",

PAH-specific therapy and survival\nDue to the short-term nature of RCTs with active treatments (12-16 weeks), \nsurvival is rarely an endpoint. To date, only the prostacyclin analogue \nepoprostenol has demonstrated a survival benefit compared to patients treated \nwith conventional therapy.41 Epoprostenol is approved by the FDA for the \ntreatment of patients with IPAH in WHO class III and IV, and is recommended \nfirst-line for patients presenting with functional class IV symptoms. Despite its \nbenefits, the complexity of drug administration significantly limits its use. \nRCTs aside, several longer-term, open-label series with active treatments \n(namely epoprostenol and bosentan) have reported 1- and 2-year survival \nrates of 85% to 97% and 70% to 91%, respectively.9, 10, 41, 80, 91, 94, 95 These results \nare in dramatic contrast to those observed in the 1981 NIH registry, where the \nmedian life expectancy for patients with IPAH, without specific therapy, was 2.8 \nyears from diagnosis, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates of 68%, 48% \nand 34%, respectively.2 Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of RCTs in PAH, \nconducted by Galie et al.,96 suggested that active treatments were associated \nwith a reduction in mortality of 43% (relative risk: 0.57; 95% confidence \ninterval: 0.35 to 0.92; p = 0.023). When viewed collectively, these data suggest \nan improvement in survival for patients treated with targeted therapies. \n7.4. Evaluation of response to treatment\nIt is important to evaluate the response of PAH patients to treatment in order \nto modify therapy accordingly. The patients can be evaluated clinically based on \nsymptoms (WHO functional class) and signs (right heart failure), and by using \nvarious parameters. Parameters that have been used include 6MWD, right \nventricular function assessed by echo, natriuretic peptide, cardiopulmonary \nexercise testing, and hemodynamics assessed by RHC. (see Table 14, page 61 for \nsuggested parameters and targets).

Combination therapy (Level of evidence B)\nThe management of patients who exhibit clinical deterioration despite targeted \nmonotherapy is challenging.47 A significant proportion of patients receiving PAH \nspecific monotherapy deteriorate despite treatment. Combination therapy is \nan attractive option with the development of several therapeutic classes of \nagents with different mechanisms of action and potential synergy.\nThe goal of combination therapy is aimed at maximising therapeutic efficacy \nwhile limiting toxicity and potential drug-drug interactions.

Combination therapy may include, 1) initiation \nwith 2 or more concomitant PAH-specific therapy, or more commonly, 2) \nsequential administration following clinical deterioration on a first-line agent.\nVarious combination therapies have been utilized. A single small trial of \nconcomitant therapy with epoprostenol initiation and bosentan added on \n48 hours later showed only trends in improvement, without significant \nbenefits.46More trials achieving successful endpoints have been carried out \nwith sequential add on therapy using a wide range of combinations: bosentan \nplusepoprostenol97; bosentan plus iloprost98-101; bosentan plus beraprost98, 101; \nbosentan plus sildenafil102-107; sildenafil plus epoprostenol108-110; sildenafil plus \niloprost111-113; sildenafil plus beraprost114 and sildenafil plus trepostinil.115\nFor patients with PAH in WHO functional class III, the most common \ncombination is the addition of a second oral drug (i.e., sildenafil to an ERA or \nERA to sildenafil).

Definition and Classification\nThe definition of PAH in children is the same as for adult patients i.e. mPAP > 25 \nmmHg at rest with PCWP < 15mm Hg 5. \nAs with adults, PAH in children is caused by a variety of aetiologies as classified \nby the Revised WHO Classification of PAH 2008 125. However, the causes of \npulmonary hypertension in children differ from adults with idiopathic PAH \n(IPAH) and PAH associated with congenital heart disease being the most \ncommon. Other causes of pulmonary hypertension in children are shown in \nthe updated clinical classification of PHT (Dana Point 2008)125 (Refer to Table 1 \nin Section A, pg23)",

Introduction\nMany different congenital heart defects are associated with an increased risk \nfor the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. They can be classified \ninto 3 categories according to the pathophysiologic mechanisms:\na.\t High volume high pressure shunts: Large VSD, large PDA, complete \t\n\t\nAVSD, aortopulmonary window, truncus arteriosus, transposition of \t\n\t\ngreat arteries with large VSD\nb.\t High volume low pressure shunts: Large ASD, total or partial \t \t\n\t\nanomalous pulmonary venous drainage\nc.\t High pulmonary venous pressure: Obstructed total anomalous \t\n\t\npulmonary venous drainage, cortriatrium, pulmonary vein stenosis, \t\n\t\nsupramitral ring\nInitially these lesions cause reversible pulmonary hypertension. If left \nuntreated, progressively obliterative vasculopathy of the pulmonary arterial \ntree eventually results in irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension. In \nthose with intracardiac shunts, reversal of flow (right to left shunt) across the \ncardiac defects will result in cyanosis; a phenomenon known as Eisenmenger \nsyndrome. \nOccasionally, progressive pulmonary arterial hypertension still develops \nfollowing initial successful closure of cardiac defects and these patients will \nbehave like idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).\n17. Clinical Manifestations\nIn the Dana Point Classification of PAH 125, PAH associated with congenital \nheart disease is classified together with IPAH and PAH associated with systemic \ndiseases. Despite significant similarities in the pulmonary vascular changes \nbetween Eisenmenger syndrome and PAH due to other causes, there are \nimportant differences which affect clinical presentation and outcome.  The \nimportant differences are listed in Table 16 152.",

Assessment\nThe development of PAH in patients with CHD is very variable with some \ndeveloping irreversible pulmonary vascular obstructive disease early in life \nwhile others with similar lesions remain operable even in the second decade \nand beyond. Approximately 50% of patients with large VSDs and large PDAs \nwill develop Eisenmenger syndrome by early childhood whereas only 10% of \npatients with large ASDs will develop it towards second or third decade of life. \nThis is in contrast to almost all the patients with unrepaired truncus arteriosus, \ncomplete atrioventricular septal defect and transposition of great arteries with \nlarge VSD will develop irreversible PAH by the end of 1st year.    \nThe determination of whether a patient with CHD is still operable or has \nirreversible PAH is difficult. The decision on surgical operability requires \nan accurate determination of the degree of pulmonary vasoreactivity or \nreversibility.

Thrombocytopenia is often seen \ndue to reduced platelet release from megakaryocytes, increased peripheral \nconsumption, thrombasthenia and decreased platelet life. Primary fibrinolysis \nand coagulation factor deficiencies also contribute to high bleeding risk.\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelets are generally avoided in Eisenmengers patients \ndue to increased risk of bleeding.\nAccurate assessment of the coagulation parameters requires the amount \nof sodium citrate in the coagulation test specimen tubes to be adjusted. In \npatients with high haematocrit, the plasma volume is too low for the amount \nof sodium citrate solution in the normal tubes and coagulation test results may \nbe falsely prolonged because of the excess anticoagulant in the plasma.
