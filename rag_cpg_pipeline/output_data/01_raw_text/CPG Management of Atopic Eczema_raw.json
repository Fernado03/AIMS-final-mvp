There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary \nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the electronic \ndatabases, mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of Systemic \nReviews, and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International Network \n(refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The search \nwas limited to literature published in the last ten years, on humans and \nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts \nin the field were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches \nwere conducted from 22 September 2015 to 20 Jun 2017. Literature \nsearches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG \ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before \n31 December 2017 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search \nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on atopic eczema e.g.:\n•\t Management of atopic eczema in primary care (Scottish Intercollegiate \nGuidelines Network, 2011)\n•\t Atopic eczema in children: management of atopic eczema in children \nfrom birth up to the age of 12 years (National Collaborating Centre \nfor Women’s and Children’s Health, 2007) \n•\t Guidelines of care for atopic dermatitis (Journal of American \nAcademy of Dermatology, 2014)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of 13 clinical questions were developed under different sections. \nMembers of the DG were assigned individual questions within these \nsections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG \nmembers met 19 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC.

            "text": "1\nManagement of Atopic Eczema\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nAtopic eczema (AE) or atopic dermatitis is a complex, chronic and \nrecurrent inflammatory itchy skin disorder. This is the commonest type \nof endogenous eczema. In majority of cases, AE starts to develop in \nearly childhood and may persist into adulthood. The prevalence of AE \ncan be as high as 20% in some countries and this continues to rise \naffecting not only developed but also developing low-income countries. \nAccording to International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood \n(ISAAC), the 12-month prevalence of AE among Malaysian children \nhas risen from 9.5% in ISAAC-1 (1994 - 1995) to 12.6% in ISAAC-3 \n(2002 - 2003), with an increase of 0.49% yearly.1 AE can present with \nvarious clinical manifestations according to different age groups. This \nmakes the diagnosis of AE a challenge, leading to misdiagnosis and \nmistreatment. AE significantly impacts the financial and psychosocial \nwell-being of the patients and families. The direct healthcare cost\nfor a child with AE in developing countries (Malaysia, Indonesia\nand Philippines) has been estimated to range from USD199 to\nUSD743.2 The psychosocial impact on the children with AE and their \nfamilies is as great as children with diabetes. Therefore, it is paramount \nto have an effective and safe treatment of AE.3\nAE is typically an episodic disease of flares and remission. However, \nit may be continuous in some patients. A multicentre allergy study \ndone in Germany, involving 1314 children from birth to seven years \nold, showed 43.2% of cases went into complete remission by three \nyears of age, 38.3% had an intermittent pattern of disease and \n18.7% had symptoms of AE every year.4 The disease is caused by \ncomplex interactions of genetic predispositions, environmental triggers \nand immune dysregulation leading to epidermal barrier defect. The \ndefect in epidermal barrier may be caused by genetic alterations in \nthe filaggrin gene. Based on a study done in Singapore, 20.2% of AE \npatients cohort carried at least one filaggrin-null mutation compared \nwith 7.3% of the control population.5 Besides genetic determination, \nthe epidermal barrier function also depends on the immune system. It \nhas been demonstrated that T-helper 2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 \ninhibit the expression of filaggrin and S100 proteins and thus impair \nthe epidermal barrier. Mechanical (e.g. scratching) or physical (e.g. \nhot water, ultraviolet exposure, sweating) irritation further weakens \nthe epidermal barrier. With the breakdown of skin barrier, affected skin \nis more susceptible to trigger factors including irritants and allergens, \nwhich can further aggravate AE.6\nClinically, AE has both acute and chronic presentations. Acute eczema \nis characterised by papulo-vesicular eruption with erythema, weeping, \noedema and excoriation. Whereas chronic eczema is characterised by",
