Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily \nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is \nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the \nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options \navailable locally. Priority of care in multisystem injuries is beyond the \nscope of this CPG.\nREVIEW UPDATE\nThese guidelines were issued in 2015 and will be reviewed in a \nminimum period of four years (2019) or sooner if new evidence becomes \navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or \nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A \ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of \nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest \nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.",

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary \nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA literature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, \nPubmed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) (refer to \nAppendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The search was limited \nto literature published in the last ten years, on humans and in English. In \naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were \nsearched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were \nalso contacted to identify further studies. All searches were conducted \nfrom 5 January 2014 to 9 July 2014. Literature searches were repeated \nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process \nallowing any relevant papers published before 31 August 2015 to be \nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on Head Injury such as \nScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) - Early management \nof patients with a head injury (2009) and National Institute for Health \nand Clinical Excellence (NICE) - Head injury: Triage, assessment, \ninvestigation and early management of head injury in infants, children \nand adults (2014). The CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of \nGuidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being \nused as references.\nA total of 27 clinical questions were developed under different sections. \nMembers of the DG were assigned individual questions within these \nsections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG \nmembers met 25 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely \non the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, \nwith local practices taken into consideration.\nii",

Most deaths in the first hour \nafter injury are the result of airway and circulatory systems compromise. \nAppropriate assessment, stabilisation and care of trauma victim \nincluding referral and transportation to appropriate receiving facility will \nhelp avoid secondary brain injury.\n5.1\tAssessment and General Treatment\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale and Score are widely used in patients with \nhead injury due to their good reliability and validity. Patient’s best \neye, motor and verbal response are assessed and categorised into \nmild (GCS 13 to 15), moderate (GCS 9 to12) and severe (GCS 3 to \n8).12 These are reliable tools to monitor and detect deterioration in \npatients with head injury. Alcohol intoxication, sedative medications, \nhypoxia and hypotension can influence the conscious level.

Other assessments that can be used other \nthan GCS are Head (AIS) and Trauma Score - Injury Severity Score.\n•\t GCS score can be influenced by alcohol intoxication, sedative \nmedications, hypoxia and hypotension.\n•\t Training on the use of GCS (technique and application) is essential \nfor accurate assessment of patients with head injury.\nTotal GCS and GCS Motor Scores including those at pre-hospital are \nstronger predictors of 2-weeks mortality than Head AIS Score scales",

Patients may also be considered to be \nintoxicated if tests of bodily secretions are positive for alcohol or \ndrugs that affect the level of alertness.\nc.\tAn altered level of alertness can include any of the following: a GCS \nscore of 14 or less; disorientation to person, place, time, or events; \nan inability to remember three objects at five minutes; a delayed or \ninappropriate response to external stimuli; or other findings.\nd.\tA focal neurologic deficit is any focal neurologic finding on motor or \nsensory examination.\ne.\tNo precise definition of a painful distracting injury is possible. \nThis category includes any condition thought by the clinician to be \nproducing pain sufficient to distract the patient from a second (neck) \ninjury. Such injuries may include, but are not limited to, any long-\nbone fracture; a visceral injury requiring surgical consultation; a large \nlaceration, degloving injury, or crush injury; large burns; or any other \ninjury causing acute functional impairment. Physicians may also \nclassify any injury as distracting if it is thought to have the potential to \nimpair the patient’s ability to appreciate other injuries.\nSource: Stiell IG, Clement CM, McKnight RD, et al.
