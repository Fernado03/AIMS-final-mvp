They are intended as a guide for the best clinical practice in \nthe management of hypodontia presently. However, it must be noted \nthat adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to the best \nclinical outcome in individual patient care, as every health care provider \nis responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on \nthe clinical presentation and management options available locally.\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in November 2023 and will be reviewed \nin 2027 or earlier if important new evidence becomes available. When \nit is due for updating, the head of the related specialty will be informed \nabout it. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will be \ndone on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised clinical \npractice guidelines (CPG). The systematic review methodology used by \nthe Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be \nemployed in reviewing the guidelines. \nEvery care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every \ndetail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or \nomissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this \ndocument, which is the definitive version at all times.",

The recommendations were \nformulated by taking into consideration the best available evidence and \nlocal practices. Several improvements have been introduced in this \nedition. The scope has been expanded to include new and updated \ninformation. In addition, clinical audit indicators have also been identified \nfor the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.\nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic \nReviews (CDSR) and Embase while full text journal articles were \nretrieved from these databases. The literature search was limited to \nhuman study, English language and published articles from 2012 to \nMarch 2023. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nAn example of the search strategy used can be found in Appendix 1. \nDetails of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the \nCPG Secretariat.\nThere were eleven (11) clinical questions which were assigned to \nmembers of the development group. The group members met a total of \n12 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All retrieved \narticles were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme \n(CASP) checklist by at least two members, presented in the form of \nevidence tables and discussed during group meetings. All statements \nand recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the \ndevelopment group and reviewers. This CPG is based on the findings \nof systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, and observational \nstudies, with local practices taken into consideration. However, \nwhen there was lack of evidence, recommendations were based on \nconsensus of group members. Although ideally patients’ views and \npreferences need to be considered in the development of CPGs, in this \ninstance, it was not feasible. \nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US / \nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),",

The aetiology of congenital \ntooth agenesis is multifactorial. \nHypodontia has unfavorable implications on dental and facial \ndevelopment particularly on functional and aesthetic outcomes. It can \nlead to problems with speech, mastication and self-esteem which may \nrequire complex and costly dental treatments. Patients may present \nwith varying degrees of severity, prompting them to seek possible \ntreatment. Hypodontia has been shown to have an impact on the oral \nhealth and well-being of individuals.\n \nEarly intervention and/or interceptive management can reduce the \nseverity of malocclusion and preserve dental structures necessary for \nrestorative/prosthesis procedures later.(5) Treatment approach whether \nto open or close space for the replacement of the missing tooth \ndepends on various parameters involving dento-skeletal profile, type \nof malocclusion, space availability, age and cooperation of the patient, \nperiodontal health as well as financial issues.\n \nHypodontia patients may require a multidisciplinary treatment approach \ninvolving orthodontist, paediatric dental specialist, restorative dental \nspecialist and other dental specialties. Thus, understanding the \naetiology, diagnosis and management of hypodontia is crucial for dental \nprofessionals to facilitate appropriate care.\nThis updated review of the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) takes into \naccount recent treatment modalities in the management of hypodontia \npatients, incorporating the aforementioned issues by embracing \nevidence-based decision making. It is anticipated that this new CPG \nwill serve as a valuable resource for healthcare providers at all levels \nof care, enabling them to effectively manage patients with hypodontia.",

Multiple theories and evidences demonstrate that the \ndevelopment of tooth agenesis is linked to genetic and environmental \nfactors.(6)   \n3.1\t\nGenetic Factors\nTooth agenesis is closely related to cellular-level issues involving \npathogenic variants of certain genes, which is the protein product \nin craniofacial and tooth development. To date, mutated genes \nhave been identified related to tooth agenesis. These genes can be \ninherited through either paternal or maternal transmission in complete \npenetrance. Mutation of the genes is also noticed in persons with tooth \nagenesis even without familial history.(7, 8) \nIn a recent systematic review, aimed to characterise and correlate \noligodontia phenotypes with their causative genetic aetiologies, based \nupon analyses of available cases supplemented with a characterization \nof ten additional families with oligodontia showed:(9) level II-2\n•\t frequency of tooth absence at each tooth position was an effect of \ndifferent causative genes \n•\t PAX9 (24.7%), MSX1 (14.5%), WNT10A (26.0%), WNT10B \n(1.5%), AXIN2 (6.1%), EDA (5.9%), EDAR (4.0%), EDARADD \n(1.3%), LRP6 (4.1%), KREMEN1 (3.8%), PITX2 (2.8%), and \nSMOC2 (1.5%) mutation genes related to non-syndromic tooth \nagenesis\n•\t WNT10A mutation caused 53.84% of syndromic oligodontia cases \nwith a mean of 13.0 ± 6.2  teeth missing per case\n•\t PAX9 mutation has a significantly higher percentage of missing \nteeth (p<0.05) in maxillary second molar, maxillary first molar, \nmandibular first molar, and mandibular second molar positions\n•\t EDA mutation has a significantly higher percentage of missing \nteeth (p<0.05) in maxillary lateral incisor, mandibular lateral \nincisor, and mandibular central incisor positions\nA retrospective cohort study reporting genetic mutation of PAX9\nand phenotypic variation within the tooth agenesis spectrum \nrevealed:(10) level II-2\n•\t missing lower second molar tooth was the most common pattern \nin patients with PAX9 mutations with a 100% affected rate\n•\t the prevalence of missing teeth in patients with a PAX9 nonsense \nmutation (66.1%) was significantly higher (p=0.004) than those",

It enables the \northodontist to visually explain the treatment plan, demonstrate the \npotential outcome and discuss the available options with the patient. \nThis helps in managing patient expectations, gaining informed \nconsent and actively involving the patient in the decision-making \nprocess. With recent technological advancements, 3D scanners may \nbe incorporated for digital treatment planning.\nHowever, in growing hypodontia patients, the provision of \ncomprehensive treatment related to prosthetic replacements (e.g. \nimplant and bridges) may be delayed.\n6.1\t\nConservative Treatment \nConservative treatment is an option in hypodontia if the occlusion is \nacceptable and the patient is satisfied with the dentition and not willing \nto commit to lengthy and costly treatment. This includes preservation \nof deciduous teeth with continuous monitoring. Preservation of \ndeciduous teeth in hypodontia patients refers to the process of \nmaintaining them in place and may involve various treatment options \nsuch as fillings, crowns and root canal therapy to ensure their longevity \nuntil exfoliated.\nA recent systematic review comprising three observational studies \nassessing survival rate of deciduous molars with agenesis of \npremolars showed 82% to 89% of the retained molars were in good \ncondition over a follow-up ranging from 5 to 13 years. However, all the \nthree studies were of low certainty.(29) level II-2\nIn two retrospective studies analysing retained deciduous teeth with \nthe same cohort of severe hypodontia patients showed, the tooth \ntypes with the highest tendency to remain in good condition were \nmandibular deciduous canine (64.3%) and second deciduous molar \n(35.7%) at 12 years follow up. Thus, preserving such teeth is often a \nworthy choice in growing patients.(30) level II-2; (31) level II-2",

In cases of missing maxillary permanent lateral incisor, \nearly extraction of deciduous incisor or canine may prevent impaction \nand allow eruption of permanent  canine into the lateral incisor position.\n(34) Extraction of deciduous teeth when permanent successors are \nmissing, constitutes an active treatment modality. \nA recent Cochrane Review assessed the effectiveness of extraction of \nthe primary teeth to promote the eruption of palatally displaced canine \n(PDC) among 9 to 14 years old patients.(35) level I\n•\t An RCT found extracting the primary canine may increase the \nproportion of PDCs that successfully erupt into the mouth at 12 \nmonths compared with no extraction (RR=2.87, 95% CI 0.90 to 9.23). \nHowever, statistically there was no significant difference between the \ngroups.\n•\t Three RCTs comparing single versus double primary teeth extraction \nfound no significant difference between the two groups in terms of \neruption of PDC at 18 months. However, at 48 months, 2 out of 3 \nRCTs showed significantly higher eruption of the PDC when double, \ncompared to a single primary tooth, was extracted (RR=1.28, 95% CI \n1.06 to 1.54).\nDespite the low risk of bias of the included RCTs, the certainty of the \nevidence was very low. \nA retrospective study evaluating the prognosis of retained deciduous \nmandibular molars without successors showed significant correlation \nbetween root resorption and infraocclusion (mesial root r=0.37; \np=0.001; distal root r=0.29; p=0.006).(30) level II-2 As the severity of root \nresorption increases, the likelihood of infraocclusion also tends to \nincrease. Thus, in the presence of infraocclusion, extraction of the \ndeciduous teeth is advisable. \nInterceptive treatment is an integral part of the overall management of \nhypodontia as it is sufficient to obtain a partial result, while establishing \nthe pre-requirements for normal growth. The prognosis of retained \ndeciduous teeth is determined based on clinical and radiographic \nexamination of the alveolar, crown and root.(36)",

Vacuum-formed retainers are also known \nas thermoplastic or Essix retainers.\nA systematic review investigating the performance of the Hawley-type \nretainers compared with other types of retainers.(55) level I\n•\t Two RCTs showed no significant difference between the two types of \nretainers in terms of survival, lost retainer, assessment of occlusion, \ndiscomfort, self-reported compliance at 3 months, speech, overjet \n(OJ), overbite (OB), intercanine width (ICW), intermolar width (IMW), \nand arch length.\n•\t An RCT showed significantly greater dental arch measurements \nchanges by using Little’s Irregularity Index in Hawley retainer at six \nmonths follow-up (p<0.05).\n•\t Another RCT showed relapse during retention in terms of teeth \nrotation was significantly higher in Hawley retainers compared to \nthermoplastic (p<0.04) in nine months follow-up.\nHowever, possible adverse effects related to the retainers were not \ninvestigated in this study. \nA Cochrane systematic review of 13 RCTs, of low to moderate quality \nwas assessed for effectiveness and safety comparing Hawley retainer \nvs thermoplastic retainer showed significant difference in terms \nof:(56) level I\n•\t stability (Little's Irregularity Index)\n\t in upper arch, more relapse was found in Hawley retainer (MD= \n0.25 mm, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.42)",

Many \ninstruments had been developed to assess OHRQoL such as the Oral \nHealth Impact Profile (OHIP), Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ) \nand condition-specific-quality-of-life-in-children-with-developmentally-\nabsent-teeth (ChildQoLDAT).\nThe OHIP is a validated questionnaire with seven domains namely \nfunctional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical \ndisability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. The \nCPQ is another validated questionnaire assessing impact in oral \nsymptoms, functional limitation, emotional and social wellbeing of \nchildren. Meanwhile, ChildQoLDAT is a condition-specific questionnaire \nfor assessing OHRQoL in patients with hypodontia.\nIn a prospective (pre-post) study assessing the impact of implant \nretained crowns on OHRQoL using OHIP-20 among hypodontia in the \nanterior maxilla found that significant improvement in OHRQoL following \ntreatment (p=0.026) with the effect size of 1.17, indicating a large clinically \nmeaningful change at 24 months post-treatment.(60) level II-3 However, the \nstudy had a small sample size.\nA cross-sectional study comparing agenesis and non-agenesis using \nOHIP-14 among participants aged 14 to 55 years old revealed that the \nagenesis group has significantly higher overall mean score (p=0.01), \nindicating poorer OHRQoL, and in the specific domain: \n•\t psychological discomfort (p=0.04)\n•\t psychological disability (p=0.01)\n•\t social disability (p=0.04).\nHowever, other four domains i.e. functional limitation, physical pain, \nphysical disability and handicap were not significant between the two \ngroups.(61) level III Unfortunately, the severity of hypodontia was not taken \ninto consideration in this study.\nA small cross-sectional study in children aged 11 to 14 years old \nshowed overall scores of CPQ were significantly higher with tooth \nagenesis (p=0.001) compared to non-agenesis in all the domains \n(oral symptoms, functional limitations, social well-being and emotional \nwell-being), indicating poorer OHRQoL.
