Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily \nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is \nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the \nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options \navailable locally. \nThese guidelines were issued in 2016 and will be reviewed in 2020 or \nsooner if new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, \nthe Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty \nwill be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for \na revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary \nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used \nby MaHTAS will be employed.\nEvery care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every \ndetail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or \nomissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this \ndocument, which is the definitive version at all times.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review \nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platform: Guidelines International Network \n(G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews \n(CDSR) and Pubmed. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The inclusion criteria are all patients with nasopharyngeal \ncarcinoma (NPC) regardless of study design. The search was limited \nto literature published in the last 20 years and on humans and in \nEnglish. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify \nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 22 January 2015 \nto 24 February 2016. Literature search was repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31 July 2016 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other CPGs namely Nasopharyngeal \nCancer Treatment by Alberta Health Services published in 2013 and \nDiagnosis and Management of Head and Neck Cancer by Scottish \nIntercollegiate Guidelines Network published in 2006. The CPGs \nwere evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and \nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to it being used as reference.\nA total of 10 clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. \nThe DG members met 23 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based \nlargely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical \ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nii",

            "text": "1\nCPG Management of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma 2016\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignant tumour of \nnasopharynx. It is most common among Chinese but constitutes only \n0.7% of cancers worldwide.1, level I According to Global Cancer Statistic \n2008, the incidence rate of NPC is 1 per 100,000 people and it was \nestimated that men are two to three times more likely to develop NPC \nthan women.2, level III Geographically, Southeast Asia, Southern China, \nand North African countries have the highest prevalence of NPC \ncompared with other parts of the world. \nNPC is the fourth most common cancer among Malaysians (5.2% \nof all cancers).3, level III There are several risk factors associated with \nthe disease. NPC is usually diagnosed late due to trivial presentation \nof painless neck lump, blood stained saliva or nasal secretion and \nunilateral mild ear block.4-6, level III In view of late presentation, its \nsurvival outcome is poor. The optimal management of NPC involves \na multidisciplinary team. The main challenge for the team is for early \ndiagnosis to prompt access to treatment such as radiation therapy. For \nthose with intermediate or advanced disease, the aim is to minimise \ntreatment side effects without compromising the outcome. \nIn view of high disease burden of NPC in Malaysia, variation in practice, \nresource implications as well as lack of local guidelines, the development \nof an evidence-based CPG for NPC is timely and essential to assist the \nhealthcare providers in managing the disease locally.\n2.\t EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS\n2.1\tEpidemiology\nThe number of new cancer cases is increasing worldwide. In 2012, \nthere was an estimated of 86,700 new NPC cases with 50,800 deaths. \nAlthough NPC may be considered one of the rarer forms of cancer \nglobally, the incidence is notably high in selected geographic and ethnic \npopulations, such as in South-East Asia and Southern China.7, level III\nIn Malaysia, NPC is the fourth (5.2%) most common cancer among \nMalaysians and the third (8.4%) most common cancer among males.3, level III \nThe male to female ratio is 3:1 for both newly diagnosed and recurrent \ncases.4-6, level III Most common age group at presentation is 40 to 60 \nyears old.4-6, level III However, NPC may also occur in younger age group \nand the youngest case of NPC detected was in a 6 year old.8, level III  \nNPC is predominant among Chinese (49%), followed by the natives of \nSabah and Sarawak (28%) and Malay (22%).4, level III In Sarawak, high \nincidence of NPC is reported among Bidayuh (48.4%).8, level III",

TREATMENT\nMultidisciplinary team approach in the management of NPC cases is \nimportant to ensure optimum treatment planning. The main treatment \nfor NPC is radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.\n6.1\tPrimary Cancer (Newly Diagnosed NPC)\nRadiation therapy (RT) is the main treatment modality for non-\ndisseminated NPC. Chemotherapy plays a role as adjunct treatment \nto RT. It can be given as concurrent, adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.\nNPC is radiosensitive and thus radiation therapy is the mainstay of \ntreatment. Radical radiation therapy doses usually consist of 66 to 70Gy \nin 33-35 fractions, treated once daily over 6-7 weeks, usually 5 days a \nweek with two rest days. Conventional 2-dimensional radiation therapy \n(2D-CRT) used to be the main technique. With the understanding about \nbenefit of conformal radiation therapy and technological advancement, \nthe therapy has evolved to 3-dimensional radiation therapy (3D-CRT) \nand more recently intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). \nIMRT has the potential to deliver higher doses of radiation to tumour \ncells near critical structures such as salivary glands, optic apparatus, \nspinal cord, brain stem and pituitary gland. IMRT improves local control \nand progression free survival (PFS) for both early and advanced stage \nNPC.29, level II-2 A systematic review on IMRT to head and neck cancer \nshowed significant reduction in grade 2-4 xerostomia (HR=0.76, 95%CI \n0.66 to 0.87) without compromising loco-regional control and overall \nsurvival.30, level I\nThere is limited evidence on Stage II disease.

Various \ncombinations of chemotherapy were used with platinum-based being \nthe commonest agent. \n• In a meta-analysis of 1500 patients, pooled data showed an \napproximate 20% improvement in 2- to 4-year survival with the \naddition of chemotherapy to standard external beam radiation \ntherapy.

MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS\nPost-radiotherapy complications such as oral and aural complications, \nand cranial nerve palsies are common in the treatment of NPC. Other \nlate toxicities post-radiotherapy are listed in Appendix 8.\n8.1 Oral Complications\nThe common oral complications post-radiotherapy are: \n• xerostomia (80% to 100%)55-57, level II-3 \n• mucositis (60% from third to fourth week after the beginning of \nradiotherapy)55, level II-3 \n• candidiasis (16% to 67%)55-57, level II-3\nIt is essential that NPC patients receive dental assessment prior to \nradiotherapy to minimise post-treatment oral complications. The oral \ncomplications among NPC survivors causes significant negative impact \nin functional, physical, social and handicap in oral health-related quality \nof life (Oral Health Impact Profile-subscale).58, level II-3 \nAt present, there is no retrievable evidence on specific dental \nmanagement in NPC patients due to lack of clinical trials for such \ntreatment modality. However, some of the dental management for the \nhead and neck cancer includes:\n• fluoride therapy59, level I\n• chlorhexidine rinse59, level I (preferably alcohol-free)\n• dental extraction57, level II-3\nTreatment for xerostomia is limited. Locally, symptomatic relief such as \nfrequent sipping of plain water and the use of moisturising mouth gel \nor gargle has been offered to the affected patients. Although there is \nlimited evidence available, pilocarpine is an efficacious and safe option \nof treatment.60-62, level I\n8.2 Osteoradionecrosis\nDental diseases increase the risk of osteoradionecrosis (ORN). \nTherefore, dental assessment prior to radiotherapy is essential to \nreduce the risks of ORN.\nOsteoradionecrosis of the skull base post-radiotherapy can be \ncontrolled by sequestrectomy combined with hyperbaric oxygen in \nmajority of NPC patients. In extensive cases, radical sequestrectomy \nwith microvascular free flap reconstruction are justified.63, level III Long-\nterm antibiotics can be used but may not be sufficient to treat an \nextensive disease.",

Symptomatic treatments such as nasogastric tube or \ngastrostomy tube feeding for dysphagia or aspiration may be offered. \nIn intractable aspiration secondary to radiation encephalopathy or \nradiation damage of cranial nerve, closure of laryngotracheal cavity \nand tracheostomy is an option.64, level III Strabismus as a result of sixth \ncranial nerve palsy can be treated temporarily by Botulinum Toxin A \ninjection.65, level III \n8.4 Otitis Media with Effusion\nRefer to Subchapter 7.2 under Supportive Care.",

PROGNOSIS AND FOLLOW-UP\n9.1 Prognosis\nDifferent prognostic categories (based on the difference in failure \npatterns) can be defined across different stages, as shown in Table 2.\n66, level II-3; 67, level III  These prognostic groupings have important \nimplications for the selection of appropriate treatment strategies.\nTable 2 : Prognosis of Different NPC Stages\nMales (p<0.05) and tumour with lymph nodes involvement (p<0.05) \nhave poorer prognosis as compared with females and tumour confined \nto the primary site in 5-year LRFS. The 5-year LRFS for male is 33.3% \nand for N1 patients is 35.0%.66, level II-3 \nDistant metastasis is the most common mode of failure in NPC, followed \nby local recurrence. While a small percentage of locally recurrent NPC \ncan be salvaged, the vast majority of distant metastasis succumbs to \nthe disease. However, patients with non-disseminated NPC (6.88%) \nsurvive two years or more after distant metastasis is diagnosed.68, level II-3\n9.2 Follow-up\nRadiotherapy acute toxicities usually take about one to two months to \nresolve and tumour will regress maximally within two to three months. \nHence, the  patients need to be reviewed post-radiotherapy to assess \nacute toxicities and manage accordingly. \nThe aims of following-up patients after NPC treatment are:\n• to assess the response to treatments\n• to manage side effects and complications which may arise due to \nthe disease process or from the treatment67, level III (refer to Chapter \n8 on Management of Complications)\n• to provide surveillance and early detection of locoregional relapses, \nwhich are amenable to radical salvage treatment67, level III to detect \noccurrence of second primary cancer \n\t There is a 24% increased risk in the development of a second \ncancer after NPC as compared with the general population \n(standardised incidence rate=1.24, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.33).69, level III \nStage\nT1-2 N0-1\nT3-4 N0-1\nT1-2 N2-3\nT3-4 N2-3\nPrognosis\nRelatively good treatment outcome\nMainly local failure\nMainly regional and distant failure\nLocal, regional and distant failure",
