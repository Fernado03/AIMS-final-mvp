The blood glucose targets should be as the following:\n\t fasting or preprandial: ≤5.3 mmol/L\n\t 1-hour postprandial: ≤7.8 mmol/L \n\t 2-hour postprandial: ≤6.7 mmol/L\n•\t The frequency of SMBG in diabetes in pregnancy should be \nindividualised based on mode of treatment and glycaemic control.\n•\t Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes on multiple daily insulin \n(MDI) injection regimen should perform SMBG at least three times \ndaily. It can be done at fasting, preprandial, postprandial or bedtime. \n•\t Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on MDI injection \nregimen should perform SMBG two to three times daily, for two to \nthree days a week.\n•\t Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes mellitus or GDM on diet and exercise \ntherapy, oral antidiabetic agents (OAD), single-dose intermediate-acting \nor long-acting insulin should perform fasting and postprandial SMBG at \nleast once daily until blood glucose targets are reached.\n•\t Pregnant women who are on insulin or OAD should maintain their \ncapillary blood glucose level >4.0 mmol/L. \nii",

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review \nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platform: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), \nMedline via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) \nand Pubmed. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. \nThe inclusion criteria were all diabetes in pregnancy regardless of \nstudy design. The search was limited to literature published in the last\n10 years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of \nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in the \nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted \nfrom 3 October 2015 to 21 March 2016. Literature search was repeated \nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process \nallowing any relevant papers published before 30 June 2017 to be \nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other guidelines as listed below: \n•\t Ministry of Health Malaysia - CPG on Management of Type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (5th Edition) (December 2015)\n•\t National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) - Diabetes in \nPregnancy: Management of Diabetes and its Complications from \nPreconception to the Postnatal Period (February 2015)\n•\t New Zealand Guideline Group (NZGG) - Screening, Diagnosis and \nManagement of Gestational Diabetes in New Zealand (December \n2014)\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to it being used as reference.\nA total of 13 clinical questions were developed under different sections. \nMembers of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The \nDG members met 22 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC.

Generally, the prevalence of diabetes increases \nwith age.1, level III This is a concern especially in the reproductive age \ngroup as this will adversely affect their fertility and pregnancy.\nDiabetes in pregnancy is associated with risks to the woman and her \ndeveloping fetus. National Obstetric Report involving 14 tertiary hospitals \nshowed the incidence of diabetes in pregnancy was 8.66% in 2011 and \n8.83% in 2012. The caesarean section rates in this group of patients \nwere around 13% in 2011 and 2012. In both years approximately 16% \nbabies born to diabetic mothers weighed 4 kg and more. There was \na 2-fold increase in macrosomia in diabetes patients in both years \nas compared to nondiabetes and this could have contributed to the \nincreased caesarean section rates. These figures were obtained from \nonly a few tertiary hospitals and the actual prevalence was expected to \nbe higher.2, level III\nThere are variations in local clinical practice management of diabetes \nin pregnancy at different levels of care. To date, there is no specific \nlocal CPG addressing this issue. This CPG, therefore, provides \na comprehensive evidence-based guideline in screening and \nmanagement of diabetes and its complications in pregnancy. This CPG \nwould assist healthcare providers in delivering high quality care.\n2.\t SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS\nScreening for diabetes in pregnant women is important to identify \nasymptomatic patients who may have overt diabetes before they \nmanifest symptoms such as excessive thirst and urination, or fatigue. \nTwo main screening strategies are ‘universal’ where all women undergo \na screening test for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and ‘selective’ \nwhere only those women at high risk are screened.\nIn a Cochrane systematic review, there was insufficient evidence to \ndetermine if screening for GDM and types of screening can improve \nmaternal and fetal health outcome in view of small studies and poor \nquality evidences. However, one of the included study showed that \nuniversal screening was better than selective screening at detecting \nGDM (RR=0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75).3, level I\nIdeally, universal screening should be adhered to. However, if resources \nare limited, selective screening is acceptable focusing on individuals at \nrisk of developing GDM.4",

Obesity in pregnancy is associated with a significant risk of \nGDM and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including pre-eclampsia. \nCaesarean section rates are high and infants of obese mothers \nare at greater risk of large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia, \nshoulder dystocia, congenital malformation and stillbirth. Thus, lifestyle \nmodification strategies such as exercise, diet and weight management \nare important to prevent GDM.\n3.1\t MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY\nMedical nutrition therapy (MNT) consists of nutritional diagnosis and \ntherapy that include dietary intervention and counselling. It is crucial at \nany stage of pregnancy in women who are at risk of GDM. This can be \nachieved by choosing healthy food with appropriate gestational weight \ngain (GWG).14, level III  \nWomen at risks of GDM should receive individualised MNT as needed, \npreferably by a dietitian.

It is known to elevate plasma glucose levels and \nworsen glycaemic control of diabetes in pregnancy.\nIn two observational studies, both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose \nwere elevated after corticosteroids administration in pregnant women with \ndiabetes.88-89, level III Most of them had to increase the insulin doses to less \nthan double of their regular doses.88, level III\nThere is no evidence on the use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids for \nother indications in diabetes with pregnancy. \n•\t Women with diabetes who are given corticosteroids during \npregnancy need regular plasma glucose monitoring (at least four \ntimes a day, for 48 hours from the first dose) and adjustment of their \ninsulin dose accordingly.\n9.3\t FASTING \nPregnant women with diabetes should be strongly advised against \nfasting during Ramadhan. However, some of them might wish to \nobserve the religious obligation.90\nIn a local study on pregnant women with diabetes who fasted during \nRamadhan, most of them who were on NPH insulin (79.2%) were \nable to fast for more than 15 days without any hypoglycaemia or",

Insulin is administered \nintravenously at a variable rate. CBG is checked hourly and insulin \ninfusion rate adjusted accordingly to maintain target CBG range.\nWomen with T1DM need to have some insulin in their system at all \ntimes to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis. Those with T2DM or GDM may \nor may not require insulin infusion. Insulin requirements decrease after \ndelivery of the placenta.\nIntravenous insulin infusion protocol\nDilute insulin to a concentration of 1 unit/mL. Use either 20 units short-\nacting human insulin (actrapid) made up to 20 mL with 0.9% saline \nsolution in a 20 mL syringe or 50 units short-acting human insulin made \nup to 50 mL with 0.9% saline solution in a 50 mL syringe. Administer \ninsulin infusion via a syringe pump.\nBased on serum potassium (K+) result, prepare a separate dextrose-\npotassium chloride (KCl) mixture as below: \nNote: One ampoule of 10 mL KCl 10% contains 13.4 mmol of K+.\n•\t Initiate IV insulin infusion as detailed in Algorithm C.\n•\t Maintain a constant infusion of dextrose-KCl over six hours, at a rate \nof 83 mL/hour.\n•\t The patient would require one dedicated IV cannula with both \ninfusions administered concurrently through infusion pumps, \nconnected via a 3-way stopcock to the IV cannula.\nK+ result\n \nAmount of KCl to add to 500 mL of 5% dextrose solution\n \n \n \n<3.5  mmol/L\n \n3 g (39 mmol)\n3.5-4.5 mmol/L\n \n2 g (26 mmol)\n>4.5 mmol/L\n \n1 g (13 mmol)",
