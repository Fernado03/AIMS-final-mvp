            "text": "i\nPREFACE\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common illness associated with major morbidity \nand high mortality throughout the world. It is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States1 \nand is projected to rank fifth by 2020 in terms of burden of disease worldwide, according to a study \nby the World Bank and World Health Organization.2 Yet COPD is relatively unknown to the public and \noften ignored by health policy makers and government officials.\nIn 1998, the Malaysian Thoracic Society with the support of the Academy of Medicine of Malaysia \nand Ministry of Health of Malaysia in their efforts to create awareness about the disease and \nimprove patient care, initiated the publication of COPD management guidelines to be used as a \nreference for medical practitioners.3 The working group comprised 10 respiratory specialists who \nwere working in government hospitals, teaching institutions and private medical facilities. The \nrecommendations made were mainly based on the published literature available at the time after \nthorough assessment by the assigned member or members of the working group and discussion \nat several face-to-face meetings. The evidence used for the recommendations was then graded \naccording to its level of strength with some recommendations made based on the consensus \nagreement of members of the working group. Notwithstanding, the concept of evidence-based \nmedicine was just emerging at that time. After more than a decade, with advancement of care \nmade and with the publication of many important large-scale, randomised studies which added \nnew dimension to the management of COPD, the time had come for these guidelines to be reviewed \nand updated. An updated set of CPG will ensure that the recommendations for the management \nof COPD in Malaysia are current. We would like to emphasise the importance of (1) early diagnosis \nthrough targeted spirometry and early intervention including smoking cessation even in mild COPD; \n(2) improving dyspnoea and activity limitation in stable COPD using up-to-date evidence-based \ntreatment algorithms; and (3) preventing and managing acute exacerbations, particularly in more \nsevere COPD.\nI sincerely hope this revised edition of the CPG for the Management of COPD will be fully utilised \nby all relevant healthcare professionals and will benefit patients suffering from COPD. I would \nlike to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who was involved in the development of these \nguidelines and especially to the working group members for their enthusiasm, relentless effort and \nimmense contribution.\nProfessor Dr. Liam Chong-Kin \nChairman \nCOPD CPG Working Group \nReferences:\n1.\t\nNational Heart, Lung, And Blood Institute.

Members of the working group were divided \ninto smaller groups comprising 2 to 5 members who were assigned to prepare documents on \nthe following sections: (1) definition, classification of severity and mechanism of COPD;  \n(2) burden of COPD; (3) risk factors; (4) assessment and monitoring  of disease; (5) reducing risk \nfactors; (6) managing stable COPD - pharmacological treatments; (7) managing stable COPD - \nnon-pharmacological treatments; (8) managing exacerbations; and (9) translating guidelines \nrecommendations to the context of primary care. \nMembers responsible for each section were tasked to ensure that the relevant literature was \nadequately searched, retrieved, critically appraised and accurately presented. Literature search \nwas carried out at electronic databases which included PUBMED, Medline and Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews. The full text of reference articles quoted in these guidelines was carefully \nstudied. In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify \nother studies. Other guidelines on the management of COPD that were referred to included the \n“Guidelines of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) global strategy \nfor the diagnosis, management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease” (2008) \nand the “Canadian Thoracic Society recommendations for management of chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease”(2007). \nEach section leader presented his/her section of the proposed guidelines at several meetings \nwhere all members of the working group met and participated in the discussion. The final draft \nof these guidelines inclusive of recommendations was the result of agreement by the majority, if \nnot all, members of the working group at such meetings as well as through e-mail discussions in \nbetween the meetings. Throughout the development of these guidelines, a total of six meetings \nwere held from 10 January 2009. In situations where the evidence was insufficient or lacking, the \nrecommendations made were by consensus of the working group.\nIn these guidelines, statements are supported by evidence which is graded using the United \nStates/Canadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence scale with the level of evidence \nindicated in parentheses after the relevant statement, while the grading of recommendations was \nbased on modified Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network’s (SIGN) Grade of Recommendations \nwhich is also shown in parentheses. \nThe draft guidelines were sent for external review. The draft guidelines were also posted on the \nMinistry of Health Malaysia website for comments and feedback. These guidelines were presented \nto the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Health Technology \nAssessment and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and \napproval.",

How can COPD be prevented?\n2. How is COPD diagnosed?\n3. How can people with COPD be optimally managed?\nTarget  Population\nThese guidelines are applicable to all adults with COPD.  \nTarget  Groups/Users\nThese guidelines are intended for all health care professionals involved in managing patients \nwith COPD who include: respiratory physicians, general physicians, geriatricians, family medicine \nspecialists, emergency medicine physicians, medical officers, general practitioners, assistant \nmedical officers, pharmacists, respiratory nurse educators, nurses, physiotherapists and public \nhealth personnel.\nCLINICAL INDICATORS FOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT\nProportion of people with COPD treated for acute exacerbation (with antibiotics and/or systemic \ncorticosteroids and/or requiring hospitalisation)\nNumerator\t\n: Number of episodes of acute exacerbation treated in one year#\nDenominator\t : Total number of patients with COPD on treatment in one year\n(#It is necessary to distinguish patients with moderate stable COPD from those with severe or very \nsevere stable COPD)\nThe optimum achievable standard: \nFor patients with\n• \nModerate COPD  \n: ≤ 1 exacerbation per patient per year\n• \nSevere or very severe COPD : ≤ 1.5 exacerbations per patient per year\nThese standards are arrived at based on the results of several recent large randomised controlled trials. \nIn the INSPIRE study involving patients with severe and very severe COPD (FEV1 < 50% predicted), the \nexacerbations rates were 1.28 per year in patients treated with salmeterol/fluticasone combination \nand 1.32 per year in patients on tiotropium.1 (Level 1) In the TORCH study involving patients with moderate \nto very severe COPD (FEV1 < 60% predicted), treatment with salmeterol, fluticasone and salmeterol/\nfluticasone combination was associated with exacerbation rates of 0.97, 0.93 and 0.85, respectively \ncompared to 1.13 in patients on placebo.2 (Level 1) In the UPLIFT study involving patients with moderate \nto very severe COPD (FEV1 ≤ 70% predicted) already on a regular b2-agonist with or without inhaled \ncorticosteroids, treatment with tiotropium or placebo was associated with exacerbation rates of 0.73 \nand 0.85 per patient-year, respectively.3 (Level 1)\nReferences:\n1.\t\nWedzicha JA, Calverley PM, Seemungal TA, et al.

Airflow limitation, associated with an abnormal inflammatory \nreaction of the lung to noxious particles or gases, the most common of which worldwide is cigarette \nsmoke, is usually progressive, especially if exposure to the noxious agents persists.\nAirflow limitation is best measured by spirometry, the most widely available and reproducible test \nof lung function.\n1.3 Spirometric Classification of COPD Severity\nObjective demonstration of airflow obstruction by spirometry is essential for the diagnosis of \nCOPD. Spirometry also provides an assessment of the severity of pathological changes in COPD. \nSpirometry should be performed after an adequate dose of an inhaled bronchodilator (e.g., 400 µg \nof salbutamol)10 (Level III) in order to minimise variability. \nFor diagnosis and severity assessment of COPD, a post-bronchodilator FEV1 /FVC ratio of < 0.70 \nand post-bronchodilator FEV1 measurement, respectively are recommended.11 (Level III) A simple but \nyet to be clinically validated classification of COPD severity into four stages based on spirometric \ncut-points (FEV1 < 80, 50, or 30% predicted) is recommended (Table 1-1).11 (Level III)",

The impact of COPD on an individual patient depends not just on the degree of airflow \nlimitation, but also on the severity of symptoms - especially breathlessness and decreased exercise \ncapacity. COPD management decisions for the individual patient should therefore not be based \nsolely on spirometry results, but also on the severity of dyspnoea and disability12 (Level III) which can \nbe assessed using the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnoea scale (Table 1-2)13 \n(Level III) which reflects overall disease impact among COPD patients than FEV1. \nA multidimensional grading system of disease severity, the BODE index [body mass index (BMI), \nairflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise capacity], better predicts survival in COPD patients than \nFEV1.14 (Level II-2) A simple but yet to be validated classification of COPD severity can be based on both \nspirometry and symptoms (Table 1-3) bearing in mind that there may be poor correlation between \nspirometric measures of lung function and symptoms in individual patients.\nTable 1-2\tThe Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) Dyspnoea Scale13 (Level III)\nGrade of \ndyspnoea\nDescription\n0\nNot troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise\n1\nShortness of breath when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill\n2\nWalks slower than people of the same age on the level because of breathlessness \nor has to stop for breath when walking at own pace on the level\n3\nStops for breath after walking about 100 m or after a few minutes on the level\n4 \nToo breathless to leave the house or breathless when dressing or undressing\nTo determine the appropriate treatment, a comprehensive assessment of COPD severity should \ntake into account the patient’s level of symptoms and the severity of the spirometric abnormality; \nthe presence of complications such as respiratory failure, cor pulmonale and weight loss; as well as \nthe presence of extrapulmonary effects of COPD and co-morbidities.

About 15% of smokers \ndevelop COPD.38 (Level II-2)  However, tobacco smoke is the risk factor for as much as 90% of the \ncases of COPD.39 (Level III)  Understandably, tobacco smoke cannot be the only risk factor for COPD as \nnon-smokers may also develop the disease.  Other risk factors for COPD are varied and are listed \nin Table 3-1.\nTable 3-1  Risk Factors for COPD\nGenes\nExposure to particles\n• Tobacco smoke\n• Organic and inorganic occupational dusts\n• Indoor air pollution from heating and cooking with biomass in poorly ventilated dwellings\n• Outdoor air pollution\nLung growth and development\nOxidative stress\nGender\nAge\nRespiratory infections\nSocioeconomic status\n3.2 Genes\nSevere alpha-1 antitrypsin enzyme deficiency causes panlobular emphysema in both smokers  \nand non-smokers.  This rare hereditary disease is most commonly seen in individuals of Northern \nEuropean origin.40 (Level II-2) There have been inconsistent reports on the familial risk of airflow \nobstruction in smoking siblings of patients with severe COPD.41 (Level II-2)  \n3.3 Exposure to Particles\n• \nTobacco smoke\nCigarette smoke causes COPD in susceptible individuals.  The risk of COPD in smokers is dose- \nrelated.42 Pipe and cigar smokers have greater COPD morbidity and mortality rates than non-\nsmokers, although their rates are lower than those for cigarette smokers.43 (Level III) Environmental \ntobacco smoke also contributes to respiratory symptoms and COPD by increasing the lungs’ total \nburden of inhaled particles and gases.44,45  (Level II-2) Pregnant women are advised to stop smoking \nas tobacco smoke poses a risk to the foetus by affecting lung growth and development in \nutero.46 (Level II-3)\n• \nOccupational dusts and chemicals\nOccupational exposures are independently associated with the severity of airflow limitation, \nrespiratory symptoms, and employment status in patients with COPD.47 (Level II-3)  These exposures \ninclude organic and inorganic dusts, chemical agents and fumes. Livestock farmers have an \nincreased risk of chronic bronchitis, COPD and reduced FEV1. Ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, \ninorganic dust and organic dust may be causally involved, but a role for specific biological agents \ncannot be excluded. Atopic farmers appear more susceptible to develop farming-related \nCOPD.48 (Level II-3)",

However, air pollution from motor vehicle emissions in cities is associated \nwith a decrease in lung function.55 (Level II-3)\n3.4 Lung growth and development\nAny factor that affects lung growth during gestation and childhood has the potential for increasing \nan individual’s risk of developing COPD.  A large study and meta-analysis confirmed a positive \nassociation between birth weight and FEV1 in adulthood.56 (Level III)\n3.5 Oxidative stress\nOxidative stress results from an imbalance between oxidants (generated by phagocytes during \nmitochondrial electron transport, air pollutants, cigarette smoke, etc.) and antioxidants.  Oxidative \nstress directly injures the lungs and initiates lung inflammation which plays a role in the \npathogenesis of COPD.57 (Level III)\n3.6 Gender\nThe role of gender in determining COPD risk remains unclear.

Early diagnosis \nwith successful smoking cessation interventions reduce the decline in lung function, and early \nintervention with effective treatment improves symptoms and health status.67,68 (Level II-2)\nA clinical diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient with a history of exposure to risk \nfactors for the disease with symptoms of chronic cough, sputum production or dyspnoea.\nThe diagnosis should be confirmed by spirometry. A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than \n0.7 confirms the presence of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is currently widely \naccepted as diagnostic of COPD.69 (Level III)\nIf spirometry is unavailable, clinical signs and symptoms, such as progressive shortness of \nbreath and chronic cough with low peak expiratory flow rate, can be used to help with the\ndiagnosis.70 (Level III) Since peak expiratory flow readings have poor specificity,71 (Level II-2) every \neffort should be made to refer the patient for spirometry to confirm the diagnosis.\n4.2 Assessment of Symptoms\nDyspnoea is the hallmark symptom of COPD and the main reason patients seek medical attention. \nThe dyspnoea is progressive over months or years and is persistent. As lung function deteriorates, \nthe breathlessness interferes with patients’ daily activities.\nCough is often the first symptom of COPD which may initially be intermittent but later present \ndaily, often with chronic sputum production. Wheezing and chest tightness may also be present. \nExtrapulmonary effects such as weight loss, signs of cor pulmonale and other co-morbid conditions \nshould also be identified and assessed.72 (Level III) Psychiatric morbidity is common in advanced \nCOPD.73 (Level III)\nCOPD patients experience fluctuations in symptoms and general feelings of well-being which can \nvary from day to day. \n4.3 Medical History\nA thorough medical history should include the following:\n• \nCurrent symptoms and the pattern of symptom development including severity of \nbreathlessness, for example using the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnoea \nscale (Table 1-2)13\n• \nExposure to risk factors and possibilities for eliminating or reducing exposure\n\t\n-\t\nSmoking history\n\t\n\t\nQuantification of tobacco consumption: total pack-years = (number of cigarettes smoked  \n\t\nper day ÷ 20) x number of years of smoking \n\t\n-\t\nOccupational and environmental exposures to other lung irritants",

For COPD, these risk factors include tobacco smoke, \noccupational exposures, indoor and outdoor air pollution and irritants. Since cigarette smoking is \nthe most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD worldwide, priority must be given to tobacco \ncontrol programmes. Smoking prevention strategies and availability of smoking cessation services \nshould be emphasised to encourage smoke-free lifestyles.\n5.2 Smoking Prevention\nSmoking prevention is the single most effective intervention to reduce the risk of developing \nCOPD and stop its progression.68 (Level I) This is endorsed by the international community with the \nestablishment of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2005.\n• \nComprehensive tobacco control policies and programmmes with clear, consistent, and \nrepeated nonsmoking messages should be delivered through every feasible channel, including \nhealth care providers; community activities; schools; and radio, television, and the print media. \nMandatory legal provision for pictorial health warnings on cigarette packs and packages is an \nefficient way to deliver clear, truthful anti-smoking messages directly to smokers.\n• \nNational and local campaigns should be undertaken to reduce exposure to tobacco smoke \nin public places. Such bans are proven to work, resulting in measurable gains in respiratory \nhealth.84 (Level I)\n• \nSmoking prevention programmes should target all ages, including young children, adolescents, \nyoung adults, and pregnant women. \n• \nInterventions to prevent smoking uptake and maximise cessation should be implemented at \nevery level of the health care system. \n• \nDoctors and public health officials should encourage smoke-free environments, including \nsmoke-free homes.\nSecond-hand smoke exposure is also an important cause of respiratory symptoms and increased \nrisk for COPD, especially in partners and offspring of smokers.85 (Level I) Long-term indoor exposure, \ncombined with crowded living conditions in poorly ventilated homes, adds to the total burden of \nparticulate exposure and increases the risk of developing COPD.86 (Level I) Adults should not smoke in \nthe immediate vicinity of non-smokers, especially children, nor in enclosed spaces such as cars and \npoorly ventilated rooms that expose others to increased risk. Children less than two years old who are \npassively exposed to cigarette smoke have an increased prevalence of respiratory infections, and are \nat a greater risk of developing chronic respiratory symptoms later in life.87.88 (Level I)\n \n5.3 Smoking Cessation\nQuitting smoking can prevent or delay the development of airflow limitation, or reduce its \nprogression,88 (Level I) and can have a substantial effect on subsequent mortality.89 (Level I) All smokers \n– including those who may be at risk for COPD as well as those who already have the disease – \nshould be offered the most intensive smoking cessation intervention available.",

Other pharmacotherapy, like bupropion97 (Level I) and nortriptyline \nhave also been shown to increase long term quit rates,98,99 (Level I) but should always be used as one \nelement in a supportive intervention programme rather than on their own. Varenicline, a nicotinic \nacetylcholine receptor partial agonist that aids smoking cessation by relieving nicotine withdrawal \nsymptoms and reducing the rewarding properties of nicotine has been demonstrated to be safe and \nefficacious.100 (Level I) The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, mostly mild or moderate which \nusually subsides over time. There are recent concerns that varenicline may be linked with depressed \nmood, agitation or suicidal thinking and behaviour in some smokers.101 (Level III)\n5.7 Occupational Exposure\nMany occupations have been shown to be associated with increased risk of developing COPD, \nparticularly those that involve exposure to fumes and mineral and biological dusts. Although \nit is not known how many individuals are at risk of developing respiratory disease from \noccupational exposures, many occupationally induced respiratory disorders can be reduced or \ncontrolled through a variety of strategies aimed at reducing the burden of inhaled particles and  \ngases.102 (Level lI-2),103,104 (Level III)\nThe main emphasis should be on primary prevention, which is best achieved by the elimination or \nreduction of exposures to various substances in the workplace. Secondary prevention, achieved \nthrough surveillance and early case detection, is also of great importance. Both approaches are \nnecessary to improve the present situation and to reduce the burden of lung disease.\n5.8 Indoor and Outdoor Air Pollution\nIndividuals experience diverse indoor and outdoor environments throughout the day, each of which \nhas its own unique set of air contaminants and particulates that cause adverse effects on lung \nfunction.104 (Level III) \nReducing the risk from indoor and outdoor air pollution is feasible and requires a combination of \npublic policy and protective steps taken by individual patients. Reduction of exposure to smoke from \nbiomass fuel, particularly among women and children, is a crucial goal to reduce the prevalence \nof COPD.",

It includes exercise, education, psychosocial and behavioural intervention by \nan interdisciplinary team of specialists.159 (Level III)\nMost structured pulmonary rehabilitation programmes last between 6 and 12 weeks.160,161 (Level III) \nThey have been demonstrated to produce benefits that last between 12 and 18 months. There \nis no consensus on the optimal duration of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. An exercise \nprogramme can be helpful in the home162-164 (Level I); 165,166 (Level II-1), in the hospital167 (Level II-1) or in \ncommunity settings.168 (Level I) In Malaysia, only a small fraction of patients with COPD are able to get \nexercise training as only a few hospitals have programmes that provide closely supervised exercise \ntraining  and access to these programs is limited. \nGeneral aerobic conditioning is more helpful than specific training of respiratory  \nmuscles.160,161 (Level III),169 (Level I) The muscles of ambulation should be a focus of pulmonary rehabilitation, \nemphasising endurance and strength training. Benefit is seen even in irreversible pulmonary \ndisorders, since much of the disability and handicap results not just from the respiratory disorder \nper se but from secondary morbidities that often are treatable. Although the degree of airway \nobstruction or lung hyperinflation does not change much with pulmonary rehabilitation, reversal \nof muscle deconditioning and better pacing enables patients to walk further with less dyspnoea.\nSupplemental oxygen should be used during rehabilitative exercise training in patients with severe \nexercise-induced hypoxaemia.161 (Level III)\nBenefits of pulmonary rehabilitation include 160,161 (Level III),170,171 (Level I)):  \n• \nImprovement in exercise tolerance \n• \nReduction in the sensation of dyspnoea \n• \nImprovement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) \n• \nImprovement in peripheral muscle strength and mass \n• \nReduction in number of days spent in hospital \n• \nCost effectiveness\n• \nImprovement in the ability to perform routine activities of daily living \n• \nReduction in exacerbations \n• \nReduction in anxiety and depression. \nImprovements in exercise tolerance are maintained for 6 to 12 months. Improvements in HRQoL \nmay be maintained for longer periods.\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine if pulmonary rehabilitation improves survival among \npatients with COPD.159,161  (Level III)",

[Grade A]\n7.2 Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy for COPD\nLong-term administration of oxygen of > 15 hours per day to patients with chronic respiratory failure \nhas been shown to increase survival.172,173 (Level I) Home oxygen therapy does not appear to improve \nsurvival in patients with mild to moderate hypoxaemia or in those with only oxygen desaturation \nat night.174 (Level I)  The goal of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is to increase the baseline PaO2 to at \nleast 60 mmHg (or 8.0 kPa) at rest, and/or produce an SaO2 of at least 90%. \nIndications for LTOT69 (Level III) :\n• \nPaO2 ≤ 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) or SaO2 ≤ 88%, with or without hypercapnia; or\n• \nPaO2 between 7.3 and 8.0 kPa (55-60 mmHg) or SaO2 of 89%, if there is evidence of pulmonary \nhypertension, peripheral oedema suggesting congestive heart failure, or polycythaemia \n(haematocrit > 55%).\nAssessment for LTOT should not be done during an exacerbation or during the recovery period of an \nexacerbation. Arterial blood gas measurements should be made on two occasions when the patient \nis in a stable condition and on optimal treatment.69 (Level III) \nOxygen therapy is not indicated for patients:\n• \nwith severe airflow limitation whose main complaint is dyspnoea but who maintain a PaO2 > 8 \nkPa (60 mmHg) and who show no secondary effects of chronic hypoxia\n• \nwho continue to smoke cigarettes \n• \nwho have not received adequate therapy of other kinds (eg, inhaled and oral bronchodilators \nand corticosteroids, treatment for right ventricular failure or for any respiratory infection)\n• \nwho are not sufficiently motivated to undertake the discipline required for oxygen therapy.\nDomiciliary oxygen therapy is available in Malaysia from a variety of providers. Oxygen \nconcentrators are generally regarded more cost-effective.  It should be prescribed by a qualified \nmedical practitioner and titrated carefully due to concerns of carbon dioxide retention.  Patients \nshould be reassessed 1–2 months after starting continuous or nocturnal oxygen therapy, both \nclinically and by measurement of PaO2 and PaCO2.175 (Level I) Subsequent review should be undertaken \nat least annually, or more often, according to the clinical situation.\nRecommendations: Long-term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT)\n1. \tLTOT should be prescribed for all patients with COPD who have chronic hypoxaemia. \n   [Grade A] \n2.\tAn oxygen concentrator is the most cost-effective method for delivering LTOT.

Low BMI is associated with higher mortality.

The goal is to try to maintain a reasonable body weight and BMI (between 22 \nand 27 kg/m2) and keep serum albumin levels above 35 g/L.179 (Level I) A balanced diet with adequate \ncaloric intake in conjunction with exercise to prevent or reverse malnutrition and muscle atrophy \nis prudent.180 (Level III) However, excessive weight gain should be avoided, and obese patients should \nstrive to gradually reduce body fat. Studies of nutritional supplementation alone have not shown \nimprovement in pulmonary function or exercise capacity.

AECOPD should be \nsuspected if smokers present with symptoms of chest infection.\n8.4 Causes of Acute Exacerbations of COPD \nExacerbations are associated with an increase in airway inflammation and are caused mainly by \nlower respiratory tract infections and inhalation of pollutants. Cigarette smoking is a major cause \nof COPD and smoking cessation is effective in reducing risk of exacerbation210 (Level II-2) and risk of \nhospitalisation.211 (Level II-2) Most (50 to 60%) exacerbations are caused by bacterial or viral respiratory \ninfections,212 (Level III), 213 (Level II-2) while 10 to 20% are due to environmental factors214 (Level II-2) and non-\ncompliance to medications, and 30% are of unknown aetiology.215-217 (Level III) Bacterial organisms \nthat have been isolated in various studies of AECOPD include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella \ncatarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, \nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii  and Staphylococcus \naureus.217 (Level III), 218, 219 (Level II-3) Other precipitating factors include congestive heart failure, cold air and \npulmonary embolism.204 (Level III), 220 (Level II-2)\n8.5 Diagnosis and Assessment of Severity\nExacerbation of COPD is a clinical diagnosis which is supported by physical examination and \ninvestigations. Usual symptoms are increased dyspnoea, cough and production of sputum which \nmay become purulent. Non-specific symptoms such as lethargy, insomnia, sleepiness, depression \nand confusion may be present. Patients tend to underestimate their symptoms and underreport \nexacerbations221 (Level III) probably because they have poor understanding of their disease and the \nterm “exacerbation”.208  (Level III)\nAssessment of severity is based on history, physical examination and investigation findings.",

Severity of COPD should be assessed based on FEV1, previous exacerbations, \nhospital admissions especially history of admission into the intensive care unit (ICU) and receiving \ninvasive or non-invasive ventilation and the presence of complications of COPD. The history may \nalso help reveal possible cause(s) of and precipitating factors for the exacerbation and concomitant \nmedical illnesses. It is worth noting that anxiety and depression are common in COPD patients \nand in those with exacerbations.222 (Level II-2), 223 (Level III) History can also help rule out other differential \ndiagnoses (see 8.6).\nPhysical examination includes checking: \n• \nVital signs – temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate and rhythm and blood pressure.\n• \nSigns of poorer prognosis – confusion, reduced conscious level, cachexia, respiratory distress, \ncyanosis and evidence of cor-pulmonale. \n• \nEvidence of co-morbid conditions – cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases, diabetes \nmellitus and lung cancer.\n8.5.2 Spirometry and Peak Flow Readings\nThese tests are difficult to be carried out by patients and to be interpreted during AECOPD.69 (Level \nIII) The measurements are not accurate and therefore their routine testing during the acute phase \nof AECOPD is not recommended. However, spirometry may be performed after the patient has \nrecovered either before hospital discharge or on a follow-up clinic visit especially if they have not \ndone it before.\n8.5.3 Pulse Oximetry\nPulse oximetry is used to evaluate the patient’s oxygen saturation (SpO2), need for supplemental \noxygen and response to treatment and to guide further management. Oxygen supplementation \nshould be given if SpO2 < 90%.69 (Level III) If arterial blood gas results are not readily available, \ncontrolled oxygen therapy using Venturi mask is recommended to avoid CO2 narcosis, aiming for \nSpO2 ≥ 90%. Morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure \nwhen the SpO2 is increased to above 93-95%.224 (Level III) However, pulse oximetry does not provide \ninformation about CO2 levels. \n8.5.4 Arterial Blood Gas Measurement\nArterial blood gas measurement is useful as a tool to assess the severity of AECOPD. It is \nrecommended for patients attending the accident and emergency department and also in those \nwho are hospitalised. It should be performed in unwell patients despite them having good SpO2 \nlevels. In patients who are breathing room air, respiratory failure is defined as PaO2 < 8.0 kPa \n(60 mmHg) and/or SaO2 < 90% with or without PaCO2  > 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg). The respiratory \nfailure and exacerbation is worse if there is respiratory acidosis [pH < 7.36 with hypercapnia \npCO2 6 - 8 kPa (45 – 60 mmHg)] and is an indication for assisted (non-invasive or invasive \nventilation) ventilation.69 (Level III) It should also be considered in patients who do not respond to \ninitial medical treatment.\n8.5.5 Sputum Gram Stain and Culture\nIn an outpatient setting, if an AECOPD is infectious in nature and does not respond to initial antibiotic \ntherapy, sputum culture and sensitivity should be performed.69 (Level III) Sputum examination should \nalso be performed on patients who are hospitalised 225(Level II-3) or whose chest radiographs show \nchanges suggestive of pneumonia.",

The presence of purulent sputum in AECOPD is enough to commence empirical antibiotic \ntherapy.226 (Level III) Polycythaemia and raised haematocrit levels suggest cor pulmonale.

Inhaled SABA is usually given in the nebulised form although there is evidence that \nadministration of inhaled SABA via a metered dose inhaler (10 to 20 puffs via a spacer device) \nhas equal efficacy to nebulised treatment.76,196 (Level III), 227 (Level I) The use of nebulisers poses a risk of \nnosocomial infection to healthcare workers and other patients.229 (Level III) Extra precautions should be \ntaken to reduce the risk of transmitting respiratory infections such as influenza A (H1N1). In severe \nexacerbations, nebulised SABA can be combined with a SAAC, for example, Combivent® nebuliser \nsolution 2.5 mL (ipratropium bromide 500 μg, salbutamol 2.5 mg) 6 hourly or Duovent® nebuliser \nsolution 4 mL (ipratropium bromide 500 μg, fenoterol 1.25 mg) 6 hourly.\nIn severe exacerbations, intravenous methylxanthines can be considered if there is inadequate \nresponse to inhaled SABA and SAAC.230 (Level II-1) The recommended loading dose of intravenous \naminophylline is 250-500 mg (5 mg/kg) over 20 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 500 \nμg/kg/hour, adjusted according to plasma theophylline concentration (10–20 mg/L or 55–110 \nµmol/L). Patients already on maintenance theophylline treatment should not be given a loading \ndose. Doctors need to be aware of interactions between aminophylline with various other drugs.\n8.9.3 Systemic Corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids are effective treatments for AECOPD and are recommended as an addition to other \ntherapies in the hospital management of AECOPD in the absence of significant contraindications. \nSystemic corticosteroids improve lung function over the first 72 hours, shorten hospital stay \nand reduce treatment failure over the subsequent 30 days.231,232 (Level I) A dose of 30-40 mg of oral \nprednisolone daily for 7-14 days appears to be safe and effective.  A study has shown that nebulised \ncorticosteroids may also be beneficial during AECOPD as an alternative to oral prednisolone in \nthe treatment of non-acidotic exacerbations of COPD.233 (Level I) Systemic corticosteroids should be \ndiscontinued after the acute episode as they are associated with significant side-effects.\n8.9.4 Antibiotics\nBacterial lower respiratory tract infections, either primary or secondary, following an initial viral \ninfection are a common cause of AECOPD. Antibiotics are beneficial during AECOPD but have no \nproven benefit to prevent exacerbations.234 (Level I), 235 (Level III) \n \nAntibiotics should be given to patients with AECOPD having at least 2 out of 3 cardinal symptoms \n(i.e., purulent sputum, increased sputum volume and/or increased dyspnoea).226 (Level III) Patients with \na severe AECOPD that requires invasive or non-invasive ventilation should also be covered with \nantibiotics.236 (Level I) The risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection include severe airflow \nlimitation, recent hospitalisation (in the last 3 months), frequent administration of antibiotics  \n(4 courses in the last year), severe AECOPD and isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during a \nprevious AECOPD or colonisation during the stable period.69 (Level III) The choice of antibiotics depends \non the local antibiotic policy (Table 8-2).",

Most patients with COPD \nare seen in primary care and it is therefore paramount that primary care physicians are adept \nin identifying, managing and preventing COPD. The best practice recommendations are detailed \nin Sections 1 to 8 and require effective translation of such recommendations to individual \ncircumstances in the primary care setting. In Malaysia, the main providers of primary care are the \npublic health centres, hospital-based primary care outpatient clinics and private general practice. \nThe factors that are particularly pertinent in this context are described in this section. \n9.2 Early Diagnosis\nEarly identification of patients at high risk is an important role for primary care doctors. Such \nidentification allows intervention to be taken such as smoking cessation, reduction of exposure \nto tobacco smoke as well as other risk factors such as occupational dusts, indoor and outdoor \npollution. \nDiagnosis should be made based on at risk individuals with symptoms of chronic cough, increased \nsputum production, or breathlessness, confirmed by spirometry. However, it is not recommended \nto use spirometry for the purpose of screening all adults for COPD. Therefore spirometry should be \nused as a diagnostic test for patients identified as at risk.245 (Level III)\n9.3 Smoking Cessation\nTo date, smoking cessation is the only effective way of preventing the development and reducing \nthe progression of COPD. Smoking cessation interventions, which include brief behavioural sessions \nand pharmacotherapy, are effective in making patients quit smoking.246 (Level III) All individuals with \nCOPD who still smoke will benefit from smoking cessation. \n9.4 Spirometry\nIn primary care, COPD is diagnosed mainly on clinical grounds alone. However, the diagnosis can be \neasily overlooked and the condition therefore is frequently under-diagnosed. \nSpirometry is strongly advocated for the confirmation of diagnosis and the assessment of COPD \nseverity. The training in execution and correct interpretation of the spirometry is therefore necessary. \nIn sites where spirometry is not available, referral to other centres where this test can be performed \nshould be arranged. Peak expiratory flow measurement may be considered where spirometry \nis not available.247 (Level III) However, while low peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) with little or no \nbronchodilator reversibility are consistent with COPD, but such findings can also be due to other \nlung diseases. Furthermore, PEFR is only reduced in advanced COPD. Therefore, it is important to \nrealise that spirometry is now the choice investigation for diagnosis and assessing severity.\n9.5 Long-Term Management \nCOPD is a chronic disease. The role of primary care doctors include the following:\n• \nEducation and counselling on COPD, and how it is different from asthma \n• \nRaising awareness of COPD and that cigarette smoking cessation and avoidance of other risk \nfactors can help to prevent the development and progression of COPD",
