In Malaysia the Dialysis and Transplant Registry 2002\nreported that diabetic nephropathy was the predominant cause of ESRD\naccounting for 47% of new cases.(2) This places an enormous burden on\nclinical, public health and economic resources as such patients often have\nmultiple co-morbid conditions such as coronary artery and peripheral\nvascular disease.\nThus the Malaysian Society of Nephrology council deemed it appropriate\nthat a Clinical Practice Guideline on Diabetic Nephropathy be drawn up\nto guide healthcare professionals, with the major objectives being\nscreening for diabetic nephropathy and instituting measures to prevent or\nretard its progression.\nThis task was given to the Penang nephrologists as it dawned on the\ncouncil that the small island had a nephrologist in every corner! Apart\nfrom nephrologists, the panel included an endocrinologist, a family\nphysician, an outpatient general practitioner, a cardiologist, and a\nphysician with interest in diabetes mellitus. The committee has attempted\nto combine evidence based medicine with the practical strategies available\nlocally to formulate these recommendations.\nThese fourteen recommendations are intended to assist primary health\ncare doctors who manage diabetic patients in their day-to-day practice to\nintervene early and effectively so that the onset and the course of diabetic\nnephropathy can be ameliorated.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the panel members for their\nhard work and commitment in preparing the guidelines. I would also like\nto thank the secretariat for services rendered, all those who contributed to\nthe final draft presentation and finally to the Malaysian Society of\nNephrology council for their infinite patience in waiting for the\nappearance of this guideline!\nDr. Rozina Ghazalli\n(Chairperson)",

It occurs in 30% of type 1 diabetics, 5 to\n15 years after diagnosis but may be present at diagnosis in type 2\ndiabetics as the time of onset of type 2 diabetes is often unknown.\n•\nMicroalbuminuria progresses to overt proteinuria over the next 7 to 10\nyears (Figure 1).\n•\nOnce overt proteinuria develops, renal function progressively declines\nand end stage renal failure is reached after about 10 years.\n2\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\nINTRODUCTION\n•\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the prevalence of diabetes\nworldwide. In Malaysia the prevalence of diabetes has increased from\n6.3% in 1986 to 8.3% in 1996.(3)\n•\nWith improvement in the survival of patients with diabetes,\nnephropathy has now emerged as a major health problem.\n•\nNephropathy develops in about 20-40% of diabetics. Known risk\nfactors for the development of diabetic nephropathy include genetic\npredisposition, poor glycaemic control, hypertension and smoking.\n•\nPrevention, early detection and aggressive intervention are needed to\nretard the progression of diabetic nephropathy to end stage renal\nfailure.\n•\nCardiovascular disease is the commonest cause of death in patients\nwith diabetic nephropathy. Thus it is necessary to address the\nassociated risk factors for this condition.\nDIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\n•\nThe diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is usually made clinically. Other\ntarget organ involvement is often present. 90-95% of type 1 diabetics\nand about 70% of type 2 diabetics with nephropathy will have\nretinopathy as well. In the absence of retinopathy, non-diabetic renal\ndisease may need to be excluded.\n•\nNon-diabetic renal disease should also be considered when :-\n- significant haematuria or urinary red blood cell casts are present\n- renal failure occurs in the absence of proteinuria \n- there is evidence of other systemic disease e.g. systemic lupus\nerythematosus, myeloma, viral hepatitis",

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in type\n1 diabetics(5,6) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study\n(UKPDS) in type 2 diabetics(7) have shown that intensive blood glucose\ncontrol reduces the risk of developing nephropathy, retinopathy and\nneuropathy.\n•\nStrategies to prevent diabetic nephropathy also include monitoring and\ntight control of blood pressure.\n4\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\nAdapted from SIGN Guidelines(1)\nFigure 1.

In these trials, there were\nsignificant reductions in the risk of doubling of plasma creatinine and\ndeveloping renal failure. These benefits were independent of blood\npressure lowering.\n•\nThe role of ACEIs in type 2 diabetics with overt nephropathy is less\nclear. As yet, large long-term studies on hard renal endpoints have not\nbeen performed. Small scale studies have shown beneficial effect on\nproteinuria but data on retardation of progression of renal failure is\nlimited.(36,45-49) Despite the lack of direct evidence, an ACEI is a\nreasonable alternative to an ARB as it is cheaper and more widely\navailable.\n•\nCurrent data suggests that ACEI/ARB should be instituted even in\npatients with moderately severe renal failure.(43,44) However renal\nfunction should be monitored closely. Refer to Appendix 5.\n•\nSeveral small studies have indicated that the combination of ACEI and\nARB may have additive effect in lowering blood pressure and\nproteinuria in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria(50,51) and overt\nnephropathy.(52,53) Data on long term renoprotective benefits is required.\n•\nCalcium channel blockers (CCBs) have class specific effect on\nproteinuria.

Statins are drugs of first choice, with fibrates as an alternative\nespecially in those with \nlow \nHDL-cholesterol and \nhigh\ntriglycerides.(73,74)\n* recommendations are graded on evidence from trials on diabetics in general as data in\ndiabetic nephropathy is limited\n14\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\nCigarette smoking should be actively discouraged\nRecommendation 9 : Cessation of smoking\nGrade B\nSmoking\nThere is clear epidemiological evidence to link smoking to increased risk\nof cardiovascular events. Smoking has also been shown to accelerate\nprogression of diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease and cessation of\nsmoking ameliorates the decline of renal function.(60-62) Thus patients with\ndiabetic nephropathy should be strongly advised against smoking. \nFull lipid profile should be performed at least annually in adult diabetics\nRecommendation 10 : Monitoring of serum lipids\nGrade C\nLipids\n•\nDiabetics often have abnormal lipid profiles with raised serum\ntriglycerides, cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol level. \n•\nWhile dyslipidaemia may aggravate renal disease,(63) the evidence\nthat correction of lipid abnormality slows progression of renal failure\nis still lacking.(64-68)\n•\nLipid profile should be performed at least annually. However more\nfrequent monitoring may be required particularly after commencement\nof treatment to achieve target levels. (69)\n•\nIn diabetic children lipid monitoring every 5 years may be\nsufficient.(69)\n•\nIn type 1 diabetics, tight glycaemic control is associated with normal\nlipoprotein level. Thus, good glycaemic control in type 1 diabetics may\nbe more important than in type 2 diabetics to reduce cardiovascular\nrisk.(70)",

Measures that would need to be instituted include :- \n- optimisation of blood pressure control and proteinuria reduction to \nretard further progression of renal failure\n- correction of anaemia\n- correction of calcium and phosphate abnormalities\n- nutritional management\n- counselling and assessment for dialysis\n- early preparation of access for dialysis\n•\nEarlier referral to a nephrologist may be indicated if :-\n- the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is in doubt e.g. proteinuria\noccurs in the absence of retinopathy, renal failure occurs without\nproteinuria\n- nephrotic syndrome or unexplained haematuria occurs \n- a sudden worsening of renal function occurs \n- blood pressure is difficult to control\n- hyperkalaemia arises\n- renal artery stenosis is suspected\n•\nDiabetic patients on renal replacement therapy (i.e. dialysis or\ntransplant) have a 2 to 4 times higher mortality risk than non-diabetic\npatients, mainly from cardiovascular disease. Coronary artery\nrevascularisation may reduce this complication especially in type 1\ndiabetics.(98,99)\n16\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\n•\nAs patients with renal failure are at a higher risk of myositis with lipid\nlowering drugs lower doses should be used when commencing therapy\nand increased cautiously. Combination of statins and fibrates should be\navoided in renal failure. Refer to Appendix 4.\nModerate protein restriction of 0.6 – 0.8 g/kg/day* may be considered\nin patients with overt nephropathy and/or renal impairment\nRecommendation 12 : Protein restriction\nGrade B\nDiet\n* one matchbox sized cooked protein source is equivalent to 7g of protein\n•\nWith the onset of overt nephropathy, protein restriction of\n0.8g/kg/body weight or less may be useful in slowing the decline of\nGFR.(75-78) More severe protein restriction of < 0.6g/kg/body weight\nmay further retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However,\nthis should be supervised by an experienced dietitian to prevent\nmalnutrition.(79)\nSodium intake should be restricted to < 80mmol/day (or 5g sodium\nchloride)* in patients with hypertension and/or proteinuria\nRecommendation 13 : Sodium restriction\nGrade B\n* equivalent to 1 teaspoon of salt\n•\nHigh sodium intake should be avoided.\n•\nModerate sodium restriction can potentiate the hypotensive effect of \nmany antihypertensives.(80-83) \n•\nA low sodium diet enhances the antiproteinuric effects of some \nantihypertensives e.g. ARBs, ACEIs.(84,85)",
