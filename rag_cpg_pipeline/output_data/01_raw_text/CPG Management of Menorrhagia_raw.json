These \ninclude guidelines from New Zealand, Canada and the Royal College of Obstetrics and \nGynaecologists, UK. A systematic review of current evidence was carried out. Ranking \nof evidence are based on a modified version of those used by the Catalonia Agency for \nHealth Technology Assessment (CAHTA) Spain; the classification of recommendation \nwas emulated from those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network \n(SIGN). The ranking of evidence is based on a modified version of that suggested by the \nCatalonia Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Research (CAHTAR) Spain, \nwhile the grading of recommendations in these guidelines emulates those used by the \nScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).The draft guidelines were posted on \nboth the Ministry of Health Malaysia and Academy of Medicine, Malaysia websites for \ncomment and feedback. These guidelines have also been presented to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and Health Technology Assessment \nand Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and \napproval. \n \n \nObjectives \nThe aim of this guideline is to aid doctors in general practice and gynaecologists in \nclinical decision making, by providing well-balanced information on the management of \npatients with menorrhagia.  \n \nClinical Questions \nThe clinical questions for these guidelines are: \ni. \nHow should the extent of heavy menstrual flow (menorrhagia) be assessed? \nii. \nHow can menorrhagia be alleviated? \niii. \nHow can patients with menorrhagia be treated successfully? \n \nTarget Population \nThese guidelines are developed to apply to women with menorrhagia. \n \nTarget Group \nThese guidelines are meant for all health care providers. \nii",

            "text": "Management of Menorrhagia \n1. \nBACKGROUND  \n \nMenorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding, is an important cause of ill health in women.  \nIt is estimated that 9 to 30 percent of women of reproductive age suffer from \nmenorrhagia, the prevalence increasing with age, and peaking just prior to menopause \n(Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, 2001; level 9). Menorrhagia has \nan impact on many womenâ€™s lives, with one in twenty women aged 30 - 49 with \nmenorrhagia consulting their general practitioners each year. It has been found that once \nreferred to a gynaecologist, 60% of women with menorrhagia will have a hysterectomy \nwithin five years, accounting for up to 75 percent of all hysterectomies performed \nworldwide. (RCOG, 1998; 2001; level 9) \n \nApart from surgery, medical therapy, appears to be an attractive treatment option, there \nbeing a wide variety of medication available to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding \nincluding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones, anti-fibrinolytics, and \nintrauterine devices. However, there is considerable variation in practice, and uncertainty, \nabout the most appropriate therapy, due to age, desire to preserve fertility, co-existing \nmedical conditions, and patient preferences (RCOG, 1998; 2001; level 9). \n \n \n2 \nDEFINITION \n \nMenorrhagia can be defined as a complaint of heavy cyclical menstrual blood loss over \nseveral consecutive menstrual cycles in a woman of reproductive years, or more \nobjectively, a total menstrual blood loss of more than 80 ml per menstruation (Hallberg et \nal, 1966). \n \n \n3 \nASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION \n \n3.1 \nAssessment of menstrual blood loss \nThere is poor correlation between a womanâ€™s perception of heavy menstrual bleeding and \nmenstrual blood loss of more than or equal to 80 ml/cycle, and between the amount of \nsanitary pads used and the complaint of heavy bleeding (Hallberg et al, 1966; Janssen et \nal, 1995; level 5).  \n \nThe gold standard for measuring menstrual bleeding is the alkaline haematin test, which \nis not freely available in most hospitals in Malaysia, since it is currently considered as an \ninvestigative tool for research. \n \nA simpler alternative to this is the pictorial blood loss assessment chart, that does not \ninvolve collection of all used sanitary material. It has also been found to correspond well \nwith the alkaline haematin test (Katrina et al, 2001), and has been validated to be better \nthan the patientâ€™s verbal history alone (Higham et al, 1990; level 5;  Janssen et al, 1995; \nlevel 5). \n \n1",

            "text": "Management of Menorrhagia \n3.2 \nPattern of menstrual blood loss \nIt has been noted that while 80-90 % of women with heavy menstrual bleeding have \nregular cycles, those with prolonged irregular and/or intermenstrual bleeding tend to have \nother intrauterine pathology (Dijkhuizen et al, 1996; level 5). On the other hand, for peri-\nmenopausal women with delayed menstrual cycles, further investigation is only \nnecessary if blood loss is excessive. \n \n3.3 \nPelvic examination \nAn abdominal and pelvic examination to exclude obvious pelvic pathology, is advised in \nall patients. The Malaysian National Cervical Screening Programme has recommended a \ncervical smear be taken at the time of the pelvic examination, a pelvic ultrasound be \ncarried out to confirm any abnormal finding, and subsequent referral to a gynaecologist \nas indicated. \n \n3.4 \nFull Blood Count \nSince more than two thirds of women with menstrual blood loss greater than 80 ml per \ncycle have evidence of anaemia, a low haemoglobin reading is considered an objective \nindicator of heavy menstrual bleeding. However, a normal haemoglobin reading does not \nnecessarily exclude heavy menstrual bleeding (Hallberg et al, 1966; Janssen et al, 1995; \nlevel 5). Since the signs and symptoms of anaemia do not correlate well with the \nhaemoglobin level until the patient is moderately to severely anaemic, a full blood count \nwould assist in determining the severity of menstrual blood loss. \n \n3.5 \nThyroid function test \nThere is no evidence of heavy menstrual bleeding being associated with thyrotoxicosis, \nbut there is some evidence of association in hypothyroid patients (Krassas et al, 1994; \nlevel 9; Attaran et al 1989). Hence, a routine thyroid function test is not recommended. \n \n3.6 \nAssessment of endometrium \nEndometrial pathology in pre-menopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding is \nuncommon, with only 20% of cases of endometrial cancer occurring before menopause, \nmostly in women are aged between 40 â€“ 50 years (Crissman et al, 1981; level 9; Jefrery \net al, 1997; Mckenzie & Bibby, 1978, ). \n \nEndometrial hyperplasia is associated with obesity and age, being more common in \nwomen above 45 years of age, with a prevalence of hyperplasia of 2 â€“ 7 % in pre-\nmenopausal women (Dijkhuzen et al, 1996; level 5; Ash, Farrell & Flowerden, 1996; \nlevel 8; Crissman et al, 1981; level 9; Farquhar, 1998). It is a precursor of endometrial \ncancer, the likelihood of progression depending on the degree of hyperplasia (Ash, Farrell \n& Flowerden, 1996; level 8; Farquhar, 1998; Kurman, Kaminski & Norm, 1985; level 9 ; \nTerakawa, 1997; level 9; Hunter et al, 1994; level 9). Infertility and nulli-parity are also \nsignificantly associated with hyperplasia. Women who have received tamoxifen appear to \nbe at increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia. However, 14% of the women diagnosed \nwith endometrial hyperplasia had none of the above risk factors. \n \n2",

            "text": "Management of Menorrhagia \nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that women with \nheavy menstrual bleeding but with regular cycles, aged 40 years or less, need not have \nendometrial samples taken (RCOG, 1994; level 9). However, some authors suggest that \nwomen with irregular bleeding or other risk factors for hyperplasia, should have \nendometrial sampling irregardless of age (Ash, Farrell & Flowerden, 1996; level 9). \n \nThe commonly used modes of endometrial assessment are ultrasound scan, endometrial \nbiopsy or aspirate, hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage (D&C).  \n \n3.6.1. Ultrasound \nUltrasonography is a primary diagnostic tool in evaluating women with abnormal vaginal \nbleeding, being able to demonstrate anatomic findings not frequently detected in pelvic \nexamination. These include small ovarian cysts, leiomyoma, endometrial carcinoma, as \nwell as evaluation of the endometrium with respect to thickness, which would indirectly \nreflect the endometrial histology, and hormonal status of patients (Okaro, 2003). \n \nTransvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) is an accurate test for diagnosing endometrial \nhyperplasia when the endometrial thickness is 12 mm or more (Dijkhuizen et al, 1996; \nlevel 5; Vercellini et al, 1997; level 5). In women more than 40 years old and who failed \nmedical treatment, 50% have an abnormal TVS (Nagele et al, 1996; level 5) \n \n3.6.2. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy \nHysteroscopy allows for the examination of the whole endometrial cavity, lower segment \nand cervical canal, being able to detect small polyps or sub-mucous fibroids that have \nbeen missed by ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy or blind curettage. In women with \nirregular bleeding, polyps are present in about 25 % of cases and submucous fibroids are \npresent in 15 â€“ 18 % of cases (Fedele et al, 1991; level 5; Dijkhuizen et al, 1996; level 5).  \n \nHysteroscopy with biopsy is the best diagnostic test for intrauterine pathology with high \nspecificity and sensitivity (Emanuel et al, 1995; level 5; Dijkhuizen et al, 1996; level 5). \nHysteroscopy alone (without biopsy) is not very accurate in diagnosing endometrial \nhyperplasia and carcinoma (Widrich et al, 1996; level 9; Vercellini et al, 1997; level 5). \n \nThe main purpose of an endometrial biopsy or aspirate is to exclude endometrial \npathology like hyperplasia, endometrial disorders or malignancies. Endometrial biopsy is \na simple, quick, safe, and convenient procedure, which can be performed on an \nambulatory basis avoiding the need for anesthesia. Furthermore, the device is disposable \nand is less costly than the conventional D & C. \n \nRoutine endometrial biopsy should not be an initial investigation for menorrhagia, being \nindicated only if menorrhagia persists or in the presence of risk factors (RCOG, 1998, \nlevel 9). \n \nPipelle and Z sampler could be used as the first line endometrial device as they have been \nfound to be more convenient to use compared to the Vabra aspirator (Bunkheila & \nPowell, 2002). While the sample adequacy rate was similar for these 3 devices, the \n3",

NSAIDs are found to be less effective than \ntranexamic acid or danazol, but as effective as other medical treatments (Lethaby, Irvine \n& Cameron, 2003; level 1), with the added advantage of relieving dysmenorrhoea (Fraser \net al, 1981; level 3) \n \n4.1.2 Progestogens \nProgestogens administered from the fifteenth day or from 19th - 26th day  of the \nmenstrual cycle were significantly less effective in reducing menstrual blood loss when \ncompared to other medical therapies (Lethaby, Irvine & Cameron, 2003; level 1), and \nfound to be one of the least effective agents (Roy & Bhattacharya, 2004; level 5). \nHowever, progestogen therapy administered for 21 days of the menstrual cycle results in \na significant reduction in menstrual blood loss, (Lethaby, 2003b; level 1), although they \nhave been found to be ineffective unless taken at high doses (Irvine & Cameron, 1999; \nlevel 9). \n \n4.1.3 Combined oral contraceptive pills \nThe combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) in addition to providing contraception causes \na 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss by regular shedding of a thinner endometrium \nnd by inhibiting ovulation (Irvine & Cameron, 1999, level 9).  \na \n4.1.4 Danazol \nDanazol is a synthetic steroid that suppresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors in the \nendometrium, leading to endometrial atrophy (thinning of the lining of the uterus) and \nreduced menstrual loss. It is an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. \nHowever, its side-effect profile, its lack of acceptability to women and the need for \ncontinuing treatment limits its use (Roy & Bhattacharya, 2004; level 5; Beaumont et al, \n2003; level 1). \n \n4.1.5 Anti-fibrinolytic agents \nTranexamic acid, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, exerts an anti-\nfibrinolytic effect through reversible blockade on plasminogen, producing a 50% \nreduction in menstrual loss (Irvine & Cameron, 1999; level 9). Anti-fibrinolytic therapy \ncauses a greater reduction in objective measurements of heavy menstrual bleeding \ncompared to placebo or other medical therapies (Lethaby, Farquhar & Cooke 2003; level \n1 Bonnar & Sheppard, 1996, level 1), and is not associated with an increase in side \neffects (Lethaby, Farquhar & Cooke, 2003; level 1, Lindoff, Rybo & Astedt, 1997; level \n5).  \n \n4",

It reduces menstrual blood loss by 80% (Irvine & \nCameron, 1999; Level 9), and is found to be more effective than cyclical norethisterone, \nwith patients being more satisfied and willing to continue with treatment. However, these \npatients experience more side effects such as inter-menstrual bleeding and breast \ntenderness (Lethaby, 2003; level 1). Compared to transcervical resection of the \nendometrium (TCRE), the LNG IUS produces smaller mean reduction in menstrual blood \nloss, but there is no difference in the rate of satisfaction with treatment. LNG-IUS \nappears equally beneficial in improving quality of life and may control bleeding as \neffectively as conservative surgery over the long term (Marjoribanks, Lethaby, & \nFarquhar, 2003; level 1).  \n \n4.1.7 GnRH agonists \nGonadatrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists induce a reversible hypoestrogenic \nstate, reducing total uterine volume. They are highly effective, but their side-effects make \nthem suitable only for short-term use (Irvine & Cameron, 1999, level 9).GnRH agonists \nmay obviate emergency surgery in patients with high surgical risk (Vercellini, 1992; level \n3). \n \n4.2 \nSurgical Management  \n4.2.1 Medical versus surgical treatment \nMedical treatment for menorrhagia is not as effective as surgery despite improvement in \ncontrol of bleeding. Oral medical therapy is associated with higher incidence of side \neffects, and approximately 60% of women who had medical treatment would require \nsurgery by 2 years. Surgery has been found to reduce menstrual bleeding more than \nmedical treatment at one year, although the majority of women prefer medical treatment \n(Marjoribanks, Lethaby & Farquhar, 2003; level 1). \n \n4.2.2 Dilatation and curettage \nThere is little evidence on the effectiveness of dilatation and curettage (D&C) for the \nrelief of menorrhagia. It is not cost effective for the diagnosis of endometrial malignancy \nin women under 40 years since the prevalence of serious uterine conditions and \nendometrial cancer is low (Coulter et al, 1993; level 9). The potential benefits need to be \nweighed against the risks of anaesthesia and possible complications like uterine \nperforation and laceration of the cervix (MacKenzie & Bibby, 1978; level 9). Moreover, a \nsignificant proportion of endometrial lesions are not detected by D&C, (Vessey, Clarke, \n& MacKenzie, 1979) and its usefulness as a diagnostic tool has been repeatedly \nquestioned.  D&C may have a diagnostic role when endometrial biopsy is inconclusive \nand the symptoms persist or when the underlying pathology is suspect.  \n5",

It enables women to avoid major \nsurgery and results in shorter hospital stay and convalescence. The various energy \nsources used to destroy the endometrium, are all comparable in terms of efficacy, and the \nre-operation rate ranges from 0 to 38.2%. The rate is higher in women under the age 35 \nyears in studies where they have been observed for longer duration. The first-generation \ntechniques involve lower costs than a hysterectomy, but the second-generation \nendometrial destruction techniques involve relatively high purchase and disposable \nsupplies costs.

(Grade C) \n \n2. \nAn abdominal and pelvic examination should be performed in women presenting \nwith heavy menstrual bleeding (Grade C).  \n \n3. \nFull blood count should be offered to all women presenting with heavy bleeding \n(Grade A). \n \n4. \nWomen with heavy menstrual bleeding with severe anemia, should be referred to a \nspecialist for further assessment (Grade C). \n \n5. \nThyroid function test should not be routinely performed in women with heavy \nmenstrual bleeding unless they have signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism (Grade \nC). \n \n6. \nTransvaginal sonography, (TVS) if available, should be the first step in assessing \nthe endometrium (Grade B)  \n \n7. \nIf the endometrial thickness on TVS is more than 12 mm an endometrial sampling \nshould be done (Grade A) \n \n8. \nThe chance of endometrial carcinoma in women less than 40 years is low and \nendometrial biopsy is not warranted unless there are associated risk factors, or, if \nsymptoms are persistent or fail to respond to medical treatment (Grade B). \n \n9. \nHysteroscopy with biopsy is indicated for women with erratic menstrual bleeding, \nfailed medical therapy, or transvaginal ultrasound suggestive of intrauterine \npathology (Grade B) \n \n10. Hysteroscopy with biopsy is indicated in women with menorrhagia if aged more \nthan 40 (Grade B) \n \n7",
