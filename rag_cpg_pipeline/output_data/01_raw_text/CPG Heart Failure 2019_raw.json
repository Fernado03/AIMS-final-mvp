The first \nCPG in HF was published in 2000 with revisions in 2007 and \n2014. \nCardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity \nand mortality in Malaysia. HF, the end stage of most diseases \nof the heart, is a common medical problem encountered in \nclinical practice and is an important cause of hospital           \nadmissions and readmissions. It is also an important cause of \nhospital expenditure. \nSince the last CPG in 2014 the treatment modalities for the \nmanagement of HF has expanded extensively. There have \nbeen many significant developments in the use of drugs and \ndevices. \nThese \nguideline-changing \ndata \nhave \nbeen              \nincorporated into this CPG, taking into account our local \nhealth resources.\nA CPG is only successful if it is accepted and implemented.        \nI encourage all healthcare providers involved in the              \nmanagement of HF in children and adults to adopt these \nrecommendations in your practice.\nFinally, I would like to congratulate the Chairman and \nmembers of the Expert Committee for developing such a \ncomprehensive CPG.  Thanks to you, as well as the External \nReviewers, for your time and effort.\nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector-General of Health Malaysia",

            "text": "6\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in \nMalaysia. Heart Failure (HF), the end stage of most diseases of the heart, is a \ncommon medical problem encountered in general practice and is an important \ncause of hospital admissions and readmissions. It is also an important cause of \nhospital expenditure. As the population ages, the prevalence of HF is expected to \nincrease.\nThe 1st Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  (CPG) in HF was published in 2000 with \nrevisions in 2007 and 2014. Since then, there have been many new developments \nin this field. Thus the publication of this 4th edition is timely. This CPG proposes a \nstructured multidisciplinary strategy for the seamless care of patients with HF \nbetween hospital and community care.\nThis CPG was drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart Association \nof Malaysia and Ministry of Health. It consists of a multidisciplinary team of cardiologists, \nnephrologists, family medicine specialists, general physicians and pharmacists from \nthe government, private sectors and the public Universities. The external reviewers \nwere also made up of a  multidisciplinary team. Members of the public - patients and \ncarers - however, were not included.\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to:\n  Update the current management of HF based on recent evidence with respect to:\n \n \n  Prevention \n    Diagnosis\n    Treatment – pharmacotherapy, device and surgical therapy\n    Rehabilitation \n   End of life and palliative care \n  Recognise and manage HF in special populations:\n    Adult congenital heart disease\n    Geriatric population\n    Pregnant women\n  Develop a structured multidisciplinary strategy for the management of patients  \n  \nwith HF both in the primary and secondary care setting.\nRATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT",

In addition to the previous \nclinical questions that needed to be updated, the Expert Panel formulated new \nquestions that needed to be addressed. These clinical questions were then divided \ninto sections and each member was assigned one or more topics.\nA review of current medical literature on HF from 1st October 2013 (the date of the \nlast CPG) till 31st August 2018 was performed. Literature search was carried out \nusing the following electronic databases - PubMed and Cochrane Database of \nSystemic Reviews.The following MeSH terms or free text terms were used either \nsingly or in combination:\n“Heart Failure”, “Congestive Cardiac Failure”, “Acute Heart Failure, “Chronic Heart \nFailure” “Right Heart Failure”, “Left Heart Failure” [MeSH], “Heart Failure Reduced \nLeft Ventricular Function”, Heart Failure Preserved Left Ventricular Function” \n[MeSH], Acute decompensated heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, \nheart failure mid-range, refractory heart failure, terminal heart failure, end stage \nheart failure, cardio-oncology.\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and \npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from \nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were \nsearched to identify further studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain \nfurther information. International guidelines on HF -  the American Heart Association \n/ American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology -  were also \nstudied. All literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and \nall statements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. \nThe grading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was \nadapted from the American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association and \nthe European Society of Cardiology (Table 1, Page 12).\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and \nkey health personnel in the major hospitals of the Ministry of Health and the private \nsector for review and feedback.",

The drugs used to treat HF - diuretics, ACE-I, \nβ-blockers have been approved for use in Malaysia and available in public hospitals \nas generics.\nThis guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimise \nexisting resources in the timely management of patients with HF. \nFacilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barrier for successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of knowledge \nof healthcare providers in the: \n  Diagnosis of HF.\n  Management of HF - initial treatment and long term follow-up.\n  Optimisation of therapy and when to refer to tertiary centres.\nImplementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical \ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n  Increasing public awareness of CVD and HF in general and educating them on  \n  \nthe importance of seeking early medical attention.\n  Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the  \n  \nimportance of appropriate management of patients with HF. This can be done  \n  \nby road shows, electronic media, and in-house training sessions.\nClinical audit by individual hospitals and units to ensure compliance using the \nsuggested performance measures in Section 12, Page 115 and Appendix VI, pg 121.\nDr. Jeyamalar Rajadurai\nChairperson",

The prevalence of HF varies between 3 - 20 per 1000 population, although \nin persons over the age of 65 years, it could be as high as 100 per 1000 population.1 \nIn nearly all regions of the world HF is both common and increasing, affecting \nbetween 1 - 2% of the population.2,3 \nThe main causes of HF amongst adult Malaysians were ischaemic heart disease \n(68%), valvular/rheumatic heart disease (29%) and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy \n(28%).4 Vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and              \ndyslipidaemia were common in Asian HF patients, particularly so in Malaysia (75%, \n67%, and 52%, respectively).4 In-patient mortality was 6%, with a 30-day readmission \nrate of 30%.4\nHF is an important cause of hospitalisation accounting for about 6% - 10% of all \nacute medical admissions in Malaysia.5,6 \nIt is also an important cause of hospital re-admissions.7,8 About 25% of patients with \nHF are readmitted within 30 days for acute decompensation.7,8 The prognosis for HF \nremains poor. The 1-year mortality rate varies between 5% to 52% depending on the \nseverity and the presence of co-morbidity.9,10 With a 5-year mortality at 48%, HF is \ndeadlier than many cancers, for example, colorectal cancer (35.5%), non Hodgkin’s \nlymphoma (29.6%), and breast cancer (10%).9-11 \nThe overall global economic cost of HF in 2012 was estimated at $USD108 billion \n(MYR 439 billion) per annum.12 The economic impact includes both direct and \nindirect costs.12,13 Globally, direct costs accounted for ~ 60% ($USD 65 billion -        \nMYR 264 billion) and indirect costs accounted for ~ 40% ($USD43 billion - MYR 175 \nbillion) of the overall spent.12 With an aging, rapidly expanding and industrialising \npopulation this value will continue to rise. \nFor Malaysia, the estimated overall HF costs was $USD 194 million (MYR 785 \nmillion), of which the direct and indirect costs were $USD 12 million (MYR 48.7 \nmillion) and $USD 182 million (MYR 740 million).12 This is approximately 1.8% of \ntotal health expenditure, with 3.6% GDP spent on health. In general, in most low and \nmedium economies like Malaysia, the indirect costs of HF in terms of premature \nmortality, morbidity, lost earning potential and unpaid care costs outweigh the direct \ncosts. HF poses a major health and economic burden and an important goal in \nmanagement is to prevent readmissions, thus reducing both direct and indirect \ncosts.12\n1. INTRODUCTION",

            "text": "34\nThis guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to help health care \nproviders in the management of their patients with HF. Beyond the Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (CPG), clinical management needs to be individualised to take into \naccount patient’s overall health goals, values, perspectives and preferences. \nSound clinical judgment plays an important role in formulating appropriate \npatient-centred care plans.\nHF is a clinical syndrome due to any structural or physiological abnormality of the \nheart resulting in its inability to meet the metabolic demands of the body or its ability \nto do so only at higher than normal filling pressures. This may be accompanied by \nsigns and symptoms of systemic hypoperfusion and/or volume overload. Patients \nmay have typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness,  ankle  swelling  and  fatigue)  and  \nsigns  (e.g.  elevated  jugular  venous  pressure,  ankle  oedema,  pulmonary  crackles,  \nand  displaced  apex  beat). Occasionally, some  patients  may  present  without  \nsigns or symptoms of volume overload.\nHF  may  be  the  result  of  any  disorder  of  the  endocardium,  myocardium,  \npericardium  or  great  vessels  although  commonly,  it  is  due  to  myocardial  \ndysfunction. It may involve only the left and/or right ventricle (RV). \nHF may be classified in many ways. A commonly used classification is by left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). (Table 4, Page 36) This has been shown to have \nprognostic significance.14-16 Furthermore, aetiology, demographic characteristics and \nresponse to therapies differ in the different classes.14,15 \n2. DEFINITION\n3. CLASSIFICATION \nKey messages 1:\n HF is an important cause of hospitalisation accounting for about 6% - 10% \n \nof all acute medical admissions and an important cause of hospital  \n \nreadmissions in Malaysia.\n HF costs was estimated to account for approximately 1.8% of total health  \n \nexpenditure.",

In  these  patients,  an  acute  precipitating  or  aggravating   \n \nfactor(s)  may  cause acute cardiac decompensation.\nThe main pathophysiology of HF is due to a decrease in cardiac output. This will \nresult in the following compensatory mechanisms:\n A higher ventricular end diastolic pressure - This is a compensatory mechanism  \n \nto increase stroke volume by the Frank Starling mechanism.\n Neurohormonal activation of the: \n  Sympathetic nervous system\n  Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n  Vasopressin\nThis neurohormonal activation is aimed at increasing stroke volume and cardiac \noutput by:\n  An increase in heart rate and ventricular contraction \n  Vasoconstriction of arterial resistance vessels to maintain blood pressure\n  Venous constriction to increase venous preload \n  Salt and water retention to increase preload\nIn general, these neurohormonal responses are compensatory mechanisms. \nHowever they can also aggravate HF by increasing ventricular afterload and \nincreasing preload to the point where pulmonary and/or systemic congestion and \noedema occur. \nIn the setting of LV myocardial dysfunction, LVEF may be:\n Reduced (LVEF ≤ 40%) - Heart failure with reduced ejection function (HFrEF).  \n Preserved (LVEF ≥ 50%) - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). \n Mid-range (LVEF 41%-49%) - Heart Failure with the LVEF being in the mid range  \n \n(HFmrEF).\n4.

They \nshould:\n Be educated on self care management.\n Recognise the changes in their signs and symptoms - a sudden weight  \n \ngain - more than 2kg in 3 days is a sign of worsening HF.\n Know when to contact their healthcare provider. \n Understand the indication, dosing, side effects and drug interaction of  \n \neach medication they are prescribed. \n Be warned about self-medication and potential drug interactions. \n Adhere to treatment and be informed of the potential complications  \n \nresulting from non-adherence to prescribed medication. \n Provide prognostic information to enable patients to make realistic decisions \n \nand plans. This is important in patients with severe HF. Chronic HF is a  \n \nhighly lethal disease, more lethal than several common malignancies. \nIn advanced HF, treatment options must be discussed tactfully and realistically \nwith the patient and family. \n8.2.1.2 Exercise training\nSeveral systematic reviews and meta-analyses support exercise training as \nan integral part of the non-pharmacological treatment of HF.168-172 \nExercise training:\n Is safe in patients with chronic stable HF.168-173\n In patients with HFrEF, is associated with a trend towards reduction in  \n \nall-cause mortality.168\n In patients with HFpEF, the clinical data is sparse.

However, a screening \nusing overnight pulse oximetry is useful to preselect a patient for PSG. \nNot only does SDB affect HRQoL, it leads to harmful effects on cardiac \nfunction, arrthymias and poorer prognosis due to the repetitive hypoxaemia, \nhypercapnia and swings in blood pressure and intrathoracic pressure. \nOSA patients are encouraged to lose weight.\nCPAP improves daytime sleepiness for OSA patients.196  In HF patients with \nOSA, CPAP have been shown to improve HRQoL, LVEF function and HF \nsymptoms.196 However, none of the evidence so far can suggest improvement \nin terms of  cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.196",

It \nhas no proven survival benefits but it relieves symptoms and reduces \nhospitalisations.236-238 It has a narrow therapeutic range and thus close \nmonitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes (particularly potassium \nand magnesium levels) is required, prior to initiation of digoxin and periodically \nduring use. \nDigoxin may be added to OMT and diuretics for patients with HFrEF and in \nsinus rhythm, who continue to have moderate to severe symptoms.236-238\nIn patients with AF, combination of digoxin and β-blockers is superior to either \nagent alone.239,240\nHence, digoxin may be considered in patients with HF and AF in the following \nsituations:\n Rate control is inadequate on β-blockers alone.\n β-blockers are contraindicated.\n Rapid control of the ventricular rate with parenteral drugs is required. \nNo loading dose is required for the management of chronic HF. Lower doses \nof digoxin and lower levels of serum digoxin (0.5-0.8ng/ml or 0.65 to 1nmol/L) \nare efficacious and appear adequate in most patients with compensated \nHF.241-243 The maintenance dose of digoxin may range between 0.0625mg to \n0.25mg daily, which may be lower in elderly patients, women and those with \nrenal impairment. \nRegular monitoring of digoxin levels is not required other than to assess for \ntoxicity. The levels should not be used to guide dose adjustment in chronic \ntherapy. Digoxin levels may be elevated in the presence of worsening renal \nfunction, electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, or    \nhypocalcaemia) or interacting drugs (e.g. amiodarone), which may lead to \natrial and ventricular arrhythmias particularly in the presence of hypokalaemia.",

The benefit of \nrevascularisation is likely to be more in patients with more severe left \nventricular dysfunction, severe CAD with angina, viable myocardium and \nreversible ischaemia.\n \nThe STICH extension trial found a lower risk of total mortality in the CABG \ngroup compared to medical therapy in patients with severe HF (LVEF < 35%) \nand significant CAD, after a median follow-up of 9.8 years.325 There was also \na significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and the \ncombined outcome of all cause death and CV hospitalisations in the CABG \ngroup.

Advanced age, \nduration of the disease, insulin use, the presence of CAD and an elevated \nserum creatinine are all independent risk factors for the development of HF.386\nDiabetes can lead to HF due to:\n  Coronary atherosclerosis\n  Co-existing hypertension\n  Diabetic cardiomyopathy - this can present as either systolic or diastolic \n \n \nLV dysfunction in an otherwise healthy diabetic person in the absence  \n \n \nof clinically significant coronary, valvular or hypertensive disease.387\nThe link between diabetes and HF has been postulated to be multifactorial. In \nthese patients advanced glycation end products, formed by a non-enzymatic \nreaction between protein and sugar residues, are increased and correlate \ninversely with left ventricular ejection fraction, the severity of the disease and \nits prognosis.388,389 In addition, other proposed mechanisms include abnormal \ncardiac handling of free fatty acids, decreased myocardial levels of adiponec-\ntin, presence of cardiotoxic inflammatory cytokines and hyperinsulinaemia by \nitself.390 \n8.5.1.1 Diagnosis of HF in diabetes\nDiabetics with HF present in a similar manner as non-diabetics.

The objectives of the \nHeart Failure MTAC are:509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n \ninterventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n \npatient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n \nand related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n \nprogram.",

Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and \ndisease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for \npharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation \nor clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 \nweeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the \nlocal organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might \nsignificantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram \nis reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n \nthe aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n \nuptitration of pharmacotherapy.",

            "text": "146\n13.1 Introduction\nPaediatric heart failure (PHF) is a complex syndrome with heterogeneous \naetiology and presentation.1 It is an uncommon condition with a reported \nincidence of 0.87 to 7.4 per 100,000 population.2 It, however, causes              \nsignificant morbidity and mortality. \nUnlike adults with HF, PHF is commonly due to congenital heart disease \n(CHD) or cardiomyopathies. However, the general principles of management \nare similar to those in adults, except that there is a lack of randomised clinical \ntrials and international guidelines for PHF.3 \n13.2 Definition\nThere are various definitions of PHF.1,4,5 PHF can be defined as\n “The failure of the heart to supply blood to either systemic or pulmonary  \n \ncirculation at an appropriate rate of flow, or to receive venous return at an  \n \nappropriate filling pressure, resulting in adverse effects on the heart, the  \n \ncirculation, and the patient”4  or\n “A clinical and pathophysiologic syndrome that results from ventricular  \n \ndysfunction, volume or pressure overload, alone or in combination that  \n \nleads to characteristic signs and symptoms, and is associated with \n \ncirculatory, neurohormonal and molecular abnormalities”.5\n13.3 Aetiology\nIn children, cardiac failure is most often due to CHDs and cardiomyopathies.6 \n(Table 18, Page 152). \nCommon etiologies are:\n At birth - foetal cardiomyopathies, foetal arrhythmias or non-cardiac conditions \n \n(i.e., perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, hypoglycaemia, and hypocalcaemia). \n Within the first week of life - duct dependent systemic circulation, i.e.  \n \nclosure or restriction of ductus arteriosus leading to a severe reduction of  \n \nend-organ perfusion in patients with critical aortic stenosis (AS), aortic  \n \ncoarctation (CoA), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). \n Within the first year of life - left to right shunts (i.e. large ventricular septal  \n \ndefect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrioventricular septal \n \ndefect (AVSD), aortopulmonary window (AP window), or cyanotic CHD with  \n \nnon-protective pulmonary blood flow (i.e. transposition great arteries with  \n \nVSD, truncus arteriosus). In both these conditions, pulmonary blood flow  \n \n(PBF) progressively increases with the fall of pulmonary vascular resistance.\n Children and adolescence (1-18 years of age) - more often due to  \n \nrheumatic carditis, myocarditis or cardiomyopathies other than congenital  \n \nheart disease.",

            "text": "147\n13.4 Clinical Presentation\nThe clinical presentation of HF varies with age. It may present at birth \n(because of foetal disease) or can develop at any stage of childhood. Table \n19, Page 153 summarises the clinical presentation of paediatric HF according \nto the different age groups. \nThe clinical presentation of HF in neonates and infants are non-specific, and \ncardiac murmurs may be absent or very soft. Absence of femoral pulse or \npresence of radio-femoral delay may suggest coarctation of aorta. \nHence, it is very important to exclude underlying cardiac disease in younger \ninfants with feeding difficulties, respiratory distress, and growth failure. \nFurthermore, features of HF in adults such as ankle oedema are rarely seen \nin infants and children.\nThe severity of HF is staged based on modified Ross classification as shown \nin Table 20, Page 153. Briefly, class 1 is absence of symptoms and class 4 is \nsevere symptoms of HF. \nAcute heart failure in children may present with hypotension or tachycardia \nwith narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, and irritable or decreased \nconsciousness.

Occasionally, other investigations such as \ncardiac catheterisation, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT \nscan may be necessary.\n13.5.1 Essential investigations (Tables 21 and 22, Pages 154 and 155) \nInitial therapy to reduce pulmonary congestion or to improve perfusion should \nnot be delayed while waiting for the results of the investigations.",

However, the findings  \n \nare generally non-specific - e.g. sinus tachycardia and left ventricular  \n \nhypertrophy. \n ECG may be diagnostic in HF secondary to tachy - or bradyarrhythmias  \n \n(e.g. supraventricular tachycardia, atrial ectopic tachycardia, heart block). \n A continuous ECG monitoring (Holter) is indicated in any patient presenting  \n \nwith unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy for possible tachycardia-induced  \n \ncardiomyopathy. \n2D-echocardiogram \nThis will provide information on: \n Structural cardiac defects (volume or pressure overload), \n Chamber sizes (dilated left atrium and ventricle in left to right shunt), and \n Cardiac function (a poor cardiac function with dilated left ventricle in  \n \nmyocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathies.\n13.6 Management \nThe therapeutic approach should be tailored to the clinical status at presentation \nand the underlying cause of HF.

Therefore, the goal of therapy is  \n \nto return the patient to a euvolemic state with good perfusion. \n Anaemia should be treated cautiously. If indicated, blood transfusion  \n \nshould be given in small volumes (5-10ml/kg) to avoid worsening  \n \nsymptoms. \nFollowing stabilisation, efforts should be made to identify and treat the underlying \ncause. All treatable structural heart defects should have corrective surgery \nand/or interventional therapy as early as possible. \nIn cases of HF due to cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, long-term medical \ntherapy is necessary.\nCommon medications include: (Table 24, Page 157) \n Loop diuretics - frusemide\n \n Indicated in the treatment of HF due to volume overload.\n  \n In decompensated HF, a slow intravenous infusion of frusemide  \n \n \nwould avoid worsening the hypotension as compared to intermittent  \n \n \nbolus injections.8 \n \n The addition of spironolactone (potassium sparing) avoids the need  \n \n \nfor potassium supplements.
