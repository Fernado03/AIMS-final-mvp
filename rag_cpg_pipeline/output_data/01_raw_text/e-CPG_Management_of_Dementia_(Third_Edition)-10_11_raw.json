These include:\n\t physical activity\n\t tobacco cessation\n\t interventions for alcohol use disorders\n\t management of hypertension\n\t management of diabetes\nAssessment and Diagnosis\n•\t The diagnosis of dementia should be based on detailed history and \nphysical examination, and supported by cognitive, functional and \nbehavioural evaluation.\n•\t Structural neuroimaging (computed tomography or magnetic \nresonance imaging) should be done in evaluation of dementia to \nexclude reversible causes of cognitive decline and other intracranial \npathology.\n•\t Electroencephalogram should be considered in rapidly progressive \ncognitive decline and atypical features of dementia.\n•\t Diagnosis of dementia should be made based on Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or the \nInternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10).\nNon-Pharmacological Treatment\n \n•\t To improve cognitive function in mild to moderate dementia, cognitive \nstimulation therapy and physical activity should be offered.\n•\t In people with dementia having behavioural and psychological \nsymptoms:\n\t explore and address possible clinical or environmental causes/\ntriggering factors\n\t offer psychosocial and environmental interventions as initial and \nongoing treatment:\n-\t psychological intervention for depressive symptoms and/or \nanxiety\n-\t personalised and tailored activities for agitation and aggression",

There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines \nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans, \n“all adults (19 plus years)”, publication from year “2009 to Current” \nand English language. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved \nliterature and guidelines were searched and, experts in the field \ncontacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted \nfrom 19 Nov 2018 to 26 Feb 2019. Literature searches were repeated \nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process \nallowing any relevant papers published before 31 January 2021 to be \nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on Dementia e.g.:\n•\t Dementia: assessment, management and support for people living \nwith dementia and their carers [National Institute for Health and Care \nExcellence (NICE), 2018]\n•\t Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with \nDementia [National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), \n2016]\n•\t Risk Reduction of Cognitive Decline and Dementia WHO Guidelines \n[World Health Organization (WHO), 2019]\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of 14 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG \nmembers met 26 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings.

It is not part of a normal \nageing process. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, calculation, \nlearning capacity, language, judgement, emotional control, social \nbehaviour, or motivation (refer to Appendix 3 on 10 Warning Signs \nof Dementia). However, consciousness is not affected. Dementia \ncan lead to disability and dependency among people with dementia \n(PWD). It is commonly associated with behavioural and psychological \nsymptoms which can lead to increased dependency on caregivers \nand subsequent nursing home admission. The lack of awareness and \nunderstanding of dementia can lead to stigmatisation and, delay in \ndiagnosis and care. The physical, psychological, social and economic \nimpact of dementia on caregivers, family and society is tremendous \nand often overlooked.\nThere are estimated 50 million PWD worldwide and 60% of them live \nin low- or middle-income countries. There are nearly 10 million new \ncases every year.1 According to Alzheimer’s Disease International, \nthe estimated number of PWD in Malaysia was 123,000 in 2015. This \nnumber was projected to be 261,000 by 2030 and further increased \nto 590,000 by 2050.2 Based on the Malaysian National Health and \nMorbidity Survey 2018: Elderly Health, the overall prevalence of \nprobable dementia was 8.5% (95% CI 6.97 to 10.22).3\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the commonest type of dementia (60 \n- 70%), followed by vascular dementia (VaD), mixed dementia, \nfrontotemporal dementia (FTD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), \nParkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and others. People with AD often \npresent initially with gradual episodic memory impairment. However, \nin early-onset AD (less than 65 years old), patients may present with \nbehavioural (frontal), visual (posterior cortical atrophy) or language \n(logopenic) variants with relatively well-preserved memory until the \nlater stages of the disease.4 VaD is associated with cardiovascular \nrisk factors, and often present with impaired executive function, slowed \nprocessing speed and memory retrieval difficulties.5 Mixed dementia \nis a combination of two or more dementia types, most frequently AD \nwith vascular pathology.6 In cases of behavioural variant frontotemporal \ndementia, the early manifestations tend to be changes in the personality \nwith executive dysfunction prior to memory issues.7 People with DLB \noften experience fluctuating cognitive decline with prominent visual \nhallucinations and spontaneous motor parkinsonism. Dementia occurs \nat least a year after the onset of motor symptoms in people with PDD.8\nAs Malaysia is moving towards an ageing nation, the country must \nprepare itself to address health issues pertaining to the older people",

The progression of atrophy follows Braak staging and is first \nobserved at medial temporal lobe structures, including hippocampus \nand entorhinal cortex with a reduction of 26% and 40% respectively \ncompared with controls. Other limbic structures including amygdala, \nolfactory bulb tract, cingulate gyrus, and thalamus are involved later.

In Malaysia, when a person is deemed to be mentally \ndisordered and is incapable of managing oneself and one’s affairs, the \nprovisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 (Part X: Section 51-Section \n75) can be applied.127 The Act aims to protect the person from his or her \nown harmful decisions or actions.\na.\t Decision-making capacity \nThe key to a person’s right of autonomy is possessing adequate \ndecision-making capacity. If a PWD’s decision-making capacity is \nintact, doctors need to respect the autonomy of the PWD to decide \non treatment options. If a PWD lacks decision-making capacity, then \na surrogate decision-maker will need to make decisions for the PWD \nbased on his/her best interest. The following points need to be taken \ninto account: \n•\t\nDecision-making capacity is determined with regard to specific \ntasks and decisions that need to be made. PWD can be judged \nto have capacity to make certain decisions, and not having \ncapacity for other decisions at the same time.128\n•\t\nIf there is any doubt regarding a PWD’s decision-making capacity, \na formal assessment of decision-making capacity should be \ncarried out. The assessment should be properly documented in \nthe patient’s notes. \n•\t\nWhere appropriate, efforts should be taken to restore the patient’s \ndecision-making capacity or encourage the PWD’s involvement \nin the decision-making process. \n•\t\nIf the Mental Health Act 2001 is used, Section 77 is applicable \nwhen obtaining consent.\nb.\t Advance directives \nAlthough there is no law in Malaysia to govern advance directives in \nrespect of healthcare matters, the common law right to refuse treatment \nis applicable.129, level III Making advance decisions can be immensely \nvaluable as it can help health care providers in Malaysia to understand \nbetter the preferences and wishes of their patients.130, level III PWD may \ndecide to make advance decisions regarding treatment while they still \npossess the mental capacity to do so by way of an advance directive \nor an advance care plan (Section 10d).

These \ninclude the following:131 \n•\t\nA doctor should comply with a patient’s unequivocal written \ndirective to refuse a particular treatment. \n•\t\nDoctors are advised to consult the next of kin or seek legal advice \nif there is doubt on the validity of an advance directive, and these \ndiscussions need to be documented.",

This \nsyndrome occurs in Alzheimer’s disease, in cerebrovascular disease \nand in other conditions primarily or secondarily affecting the brain. \nIn assessing the presence or absence of dementia, special care should \nbe taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional \nfactors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and \ngeneral physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may \naccount for failure to perform. \nDementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning \nand usually some interference with personal activities of daily living, \nsuch as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and \ntoilet activities. How such a decline manifests itself will depend largely \non the social and cultural setting in which the patient lives. Changes in \nrole performance, such as lowered ability to keep or find a job, should \nnot be used as criteria for dementia because of the large cross-cultural \ndifferences that exist in what is appropriate and because there may be \nfrequent, externally imposed changes in the availability of work within \na particular culture. \nIf depressive symptoms are present but the criteria for depressive \nepisode (F32.0-F32.3) are not fulfilled, they can be recorded by means \nof a fifth character.

It is broken down into seven different stages. Stages 1 - 3 are \nthe pre-dementia stages while Stages 4 - 7 are the dementia stages. \nBeginning in stage 5, an individual can no longer survive without \nassistance. Within the GDS, each stage is numbered (1 - 7), given a \nshort title (i.e., forgetfulness, early confusional, etc. followed by a brief \nlisting of the characteristics for that stage. Caregivers can get a rough \nidea of where an individual is at in the disease process by observing \nthat individual’s behavioural characteristics and comparing them to the \nGDS. For more specific assessments, use the accompanying Brief \nCognitive Rating Scale (BCRS) and the FAST measures.\nClinical Characteristics\nLevel\nNo subjective complaints of memory deficit. \nNo memory deficit evident on clinical \ninterview.\nSubjective complaints of memory deficit, \nmost frequently in the following areas: (a) \nforgetting where one has placed familiar \nobjects; (b) forgetting names one formerly \nknew well.

SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS/CARERS\nb. Learn to engage with PWD\n3. RECOGNISE FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS OF CARE FOR PWD\n• The caregivers need to understand about dementia and the importance \nof early detection and early diagnosis.\n• PWD feel stressed when they are unable to recall what has just \nhappened. They may also be disorientated to time, place and person. \nThough their memory, understanding and judgement are declining, \ntheir emotion may still be intact.\na. Recognise the stress and challenges faced by PWD and \nsuggested carer responses\n• Caring for PWD may cause stress to family and caregivers. Build-up \nof stress may lead to emotional problems and poor health of the \ncaregivers. One of the ways to relieve the stress is to have someone \nto talk to, e.g. using telephone counselling service or participating in \nsupport group events which are tailored to their needs. The support \ngroup should also involve other family members as well.\n• Caregivers should be aware of their own physical and mental health \nissues e.g. increased risk of depression and over tiredness. \nTherefore, respite care should be offered for adequate support to \nhelp caregivers in coping with caring for PWD.\ni. Forgetfulness: \n \nPWD do not recall what they \ntalked about and with whom \nthey talked.\nii. Disorientated to time, place \nand person: \n \nPWD may repeatedly ask the \nday, date, where they are and \nwho the persons around them.\niii. Impaired understanding and \njudgement: \n \nFor instance, PWD may become \nunable to cook, use remote \ncontrol for television or operate \nthe washing machine.\nHelpful tips:\nCourteously answer the questions \nbecause PWD have difficulty to \nrecall and may be repeatedly \nasking question for confirmation as \na result of being anxious.\nHelpful tips:\nPWD may have problems organis-\ning and making plans and, execut-\ning tasks correctly. Confirm with \nthem the actions that they are \ndoing and ask what they want to \ndo next step by step.\nHelpful Tips: \nEngage in the activity together with \nPWD. For example, instead of \nallowing person with dementia to \ncook, let them do simple things like \nwashing vegetables or peeling",

The \ncarer can try to engage by asking \n“where are you going” and “why \nare you going?” Carer may then \nhelp them to achieve their purpose. \nIt is also useful to put a name tag \nwith their name, address and \ncontact details on their clothes so \nthat others can assist them in \nfinding their way home.\nHelpful tips:\nCarers will need to be more \naccommodating and avoid triggers \nor \nsituations \nthat \nhurt \ntheir \nfeelings.\nHelpful tips:\nExplain regarding timing of meals \nby mentioning actual time.
