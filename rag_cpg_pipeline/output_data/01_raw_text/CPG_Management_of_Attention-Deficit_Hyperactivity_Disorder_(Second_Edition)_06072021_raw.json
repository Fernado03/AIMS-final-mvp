There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines \nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans, \n“all child (0 to 18 years)” (in most searches), publication from year “2008 \nto Current” and English language. In addition, the reference lists of all \nretrieved literature and guidelines were searched and, experts in the \nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted \nfrom 19 Mac 2017 to 18 May 2018. Literature searches were repeated \nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process \nallowing any relevant papers published before 21 January 2020 to be \nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) e.g.:\n•\t Canadian ADHD Practice Guidelines (CAP-Guidelines), 4.1 \n[Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA), 2020]\n•\t Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and \nTreatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children \nand Adolescents [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), 2019]\n•\t Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: diagnosis and management \n[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 2018]\n•\t Management of attention deficit and hyperkinetic disorders in \nchildren and young people [Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines \nNetwork (SIGN), 2009]\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of 14 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 24 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines.

All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. This \nCPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-\nanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of \nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows \nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external \nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for \nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented \nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG \nCouncil MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

It is defined as \na persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactive and impulsive \nbehaviour that is more frequent and severe than is typically seen in a \nchild at a given developmental stage. It appears in childhood and often \nlasts into adulthood. \nChildren and adolescents with ADHD face significant problems in \nbehavioural control, interpersonal relationships, academic performance \nand personal issues.1, 2 They have worse health-related quality of life \nscores than the typically developing groups varying from a small to \nmoderate degree in physical domains and a large degree in psychosocial \ndomains.3 Therefore, early recognition, assessment and management \nof this condition is very important in helping them and their parents to \nimprove the educational and psychosocial difficulties. \nWorldwide, the estimated prevalence of childhood ADHD is 5.29%.4 \nIn Malaysia, the estimated prevalence of ADHD range from 1.6% to \n4.6%.5, 6 Boys are three to four times more likely to be diagnosed with \nADHD than girls.6 - 8\nThis CPG is a full review of the previous edition of guidelines on the \nmanagement of ADHD published in 2008. It aims to reduce variation \nin practice and, address advancement in diagnosis and treatment \nof ADHD. In this edition, a new scope on adult ADHD and transition \nperiod into adulthood is addressed because of its growing significance \nin clinical practice.",

Combination Treatment\nPharmacotherapy alone or in combination with non-pharmacological \ntreatment can be offered in ADHD.

Dietary Modification\nDietary modification for ADHD is divided into elimination and \nsupplementation diets.  Elimination diet includes removal of artificial \nfood colourants, additives, sugar, artificial sweeteners and Few Foods \nDiet (FFD).  FFD is a diet that excludes all but a few food items \nfor a certain duration. It normally includes two types of meat, two \nsources of carbohydrates, two vegetables, two fruits, oil and water. \nSupplementation diet involve addition of amino acids, essential fatty \nacids, vitamins and minerals.63, level I",
