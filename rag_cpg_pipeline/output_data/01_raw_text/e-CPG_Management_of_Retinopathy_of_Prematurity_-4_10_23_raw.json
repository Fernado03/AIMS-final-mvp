Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. \nThe inclusion criteria are all infants with risk of developing ROP and \nthose with the established disease regardless of study design. The first \nsearch was limited to literature published over the last 18 years (2005 \n- 2023) since the first CPG edition. The search was based on inclusion \ncriteria and all studies were in English. In addition, the reference lists of \nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify \nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted for studies \nrelated to the issues addressed. All searches were conducted from \n8 March 2022 to 23 March 2022. The literature search was repeated \nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process \nallowing any relevant papers published before 17 March 2023 to be \nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines on ROP as listed below: \n•\t Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. UK Screening of \nRetinopathy of Prematurity Guideline, 2022\n•\t Royal College of Ophthalmologist, Clinical Practice Guideline on \nTreating Retinopathy of Prematurity in the UK, 2022\nA total of 13 main clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG \nmembers met 18 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and Review Committee (RC). Where evidence was insufficient, \nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. \nAny differences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.",

This potentially \nblinding condition is largely preventable if appropriate, adequate and \naccessible screening programme are available. However, the pre-\nexisting ROP screening protocol needs to be updated based on the \nlatest development in neonatal care.  \nA 2019 report by the Malaysian National Neonatal Registry reviewed \nthe screening for ROP of 2,145 inborn infants at gestational age <32 \nweeks who survived to six weeks of age before discharged from \nneonatal care. A total of 87.1% infants did not have ROP, 10.7% had \nROP stage 1 or 2, 1.6% stage 3 and 0.4% stage 4 or 5. The incidence \nrate of severe ROP (stage 3, 4 and 5) were 20%, 7% and 0.7% in \ninfants with gestational age of 22 - 24 weeks, 25 - 27 weeks and 28 - \n31 weeks respectively. A total of 38 infants had laser therapy and one \ninfant underwent cryotherapy.1, level III \nThe first local edition of the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the \nmanagement of ROP was published in 2005. With the advances \nin research and technology, there is a great shift in the paradigm of \nclassification and treatment of the disease. This current edition intends \nto update the recommendations in the management which includes \nInternational Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity Third Edition \n(ICROP-3) classification, intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth \nfactor (anti-VEGF) treatment and vitrectomy techniques.\nIt is hoped that this latest edition of the CPG will improve the management \nof ROP and thus prevent visual impairment (VI) and blindness in the \naffected children.",

After topical application to the \nconjunctiva, \nphenylephrine \nacts \ndirectly \non \nα-adrenergic \nreceptors \nin \nthe \neye, \nproducing \ncontraction of the dilator muscle of the pupil and \nconstriction of the arterioles in the conjunctiva.\nPhenylephrine 2.5% \nOphthalmic Solution\n3.",
