The group consists of otorhinolaryngologists, \npaediatrician, family medicine specialists, public health physicians, \naudiologists, a pharmacist and an assistant medical officer. There was \nactive involvement of the multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) \nduring the process of development of these guidelines.\nLiterature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: \nGuidelines International Network (G-I-N), Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane \nDatabase of Systemic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of \nReviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Journal full text via OVID search \nengine, International Health Technology Assessment websites (refer to \nAppendix 1 for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists of all \nretrieved articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Experts \nin the field were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches \nwere officially conducted between 17 August 2010 and 11 August 2011. \nLiterature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of \nthe CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published \nup until 21 February 2012 to be considered. Future CPG updates will \nconsider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the \nsearch strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG secretariat. \nSearch was limited to literature published in English.\nReference was also made to other guidelines on Otitis Media with \nEffusion such as National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and \nChildren’s Health – Surgical Management of Children with Otitis Media \nwith Effusion (OME) (2008); American Academy of Pediatrics - Clinical \nPractice Guideline, Otitis Media with Effusion. Pediatrics (2004); \nAmerican Academy of  Family Physicians (AAFP), American Academy \nof Otorhinolaryngology-Head  And Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), Academy \nof Pediatrics (AAP) Subcommittee on Otitis Media with Effusion - \nClinical Practice Guideline, Otitis Media with Effusion (2004); Scottish \nIntercollegiate Guidelines Network - Diagnosis and Management of \nChildhood Otitis Media in Primary Care (2003); National Institute for \nClinical Excellence - Referral Advice, Persistent Otitis Media With \nEffusion (Glue Ear) In Children (2001). These CPGs were evaluated \nusing the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) \nprior being used as references.\nFifteen clinical questions were developed under four sections and \nmembers of the development group were assigned individual questions \nwithin these subtopics (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions).\nii",

All literature retrieved was appraised using \nCritical Appraisal Skills Programme (Oxford) by at least two members \nand presented in the form of evidence tables and discussed during \ndevelopment group meetings.

Eighty percent of children have at least one episode of \nOME by the age of 10 years.1 In Malaysia, the overall prevalence is \n2.9% with an estimated cases of 761,962.2, level III These figures however \nmay not reflect the actual disease burden as confirmatory testing could \nnot be done in some children during the field survey. A study among \npreschoolers found that the prevalence rate of OME was 18.3%.3, level IIII \nThis disease is also a common ear problem among children especially \nthose with craniofacial anomalies including cleft palate and Down \nsyndrome (DS). A local study conducted in 1992 showed that the \nincidence of OME in children with cleft palate was 57.6%.4, level III  \nOME is known to be a fluctuating condition with symptoms that vary with \ntime and age. However, the problem may persist in certain percentage \nof children.  The main symptom of OME is impaired hearing.1; 5, level III \nThis condition is often underdiagnosed, leading to untreated hearing \nimpairment, which can cause speech and language developmental \ndelay and poor school performance.6\nWhile most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, some children \nwill need intervention in the form of educational and social action or \nthe provision of hearing aids because of the effects of hearing loss.1 \nLong-standing and untreated cases of OME may progress to serious \nconditions such as adhesive otitis media, ossicular chain disruption, \nretraction pockets and cholesteatoma.  \nMedical therapy has been widely used to treat the condition although \nevidence-based benefit has yet to be established. Surgical treatment \noptions include myringotomy with or without ventilation tube (VT) \ninsertion, adenoidectomy or both. Opinions regarding the risks and \nbenefits of VT insertion vary and the management of OME therefore \nremains controversial.7, level I; 8, level III\nThe need for a local evidence-based CPG is timely due to variation \nin clinical practice, potential negative impact of OME on hearing and \ncognitive function, and to assist healthcare providers in the management \nof this condition.",

The operation is performed through the ear \nwithout external incision.\nWhat is a ventilation tube (grommet)?\nA ventilation tube is a small tube (ranging from 1.04 - 1.54 mm in \ndiameter) which is inserted onto the tympanic membrane.\nWhy does a child need this operation?\nThis operation is performed to ventilate (aerate) the middle ear, to drain \nthe middle ear fluid and to prevent the fluid reaccumulation. This should \nimprove the hearing if the hearing loss is due to OME.\nHow long does the ventilation tube stay in-situ?\nIt depends on the type of ventilation tube. The short term ventilation \ntube usually will come out on its own after 3 to 6 months.\nWhat type of anaesthetic will a child require? \nThe operation is usually performed under general anaesthesia.\nWhat should be expected after the operation?\nThe child may be drowsy for a few hours post-operatively.\nWhat are the risks and consequences after the operation?\nMost operations are safe; however there is a small chance of side \neffects/complications such as:\n•\t\nEar pain\nThere will be slight discomfort or mild ear pain which will usually \nsubsides within 1 - 2 days and does not require analgesics. \nParacetamol can be given for analgesia.",
