The search was limited to literature published on humans, \npublication from year “2012 to Current” and English language. In \naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines \nwere searched, and experts in the field contacted to identify relevant \nstudies. All searches were conducted from 22 October 2021 to 10 \nJanuary 2022. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31 December 2023 to be included. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on Thalassaemia which \nare:\n•\t Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF) - Guidelines for the \nManagement of Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia (TDT) 4th \nEdition (Version 2.0) (2021)\n•\t Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF) - Guidelines for the \nManagement of Non-Transfusion Dependent β-Thalassaemia 3rd \nEdition (2023)\n•\t Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF) - Guidelines for the \nManagement of Non-Transfusion Dependent α-Thalassaemia 3rd \nEdition (2023)\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of 27 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions).

Patients of this disorder can be categorised into two spectra; \ntransfusion-dependent thalassaemia (TDT) and non-transfusion- \ndependent thalassaemia (NTDT).1\nThalassaemia is a major public health issue with an enormous cost \nburden for MoH.2 - 3, level III Effective control of the disease has led to \nincreased survival, reduced morbidity and improved quality of life for \nthalassaemia patients. This guideline optimises the multi-discipline \ntreatment and address adequate prevention of the disease.\nTDT patients require regular, life-long blood transfusion to alleviate \nsymptomatic anaemia, suppress ineffective erythropoiesis, enhance \ngrowth and development which will lead to improved survival rate. On \nthe other hand, NTDT patients might require blood transfusion only when \nthey have symptomatic anaemia, poor quality of life, compromising \ngrowth and development, or if there are features of extramedullary \nhaematopoiesis. TDT and NTDT are fluid categories, based on clinical \nparameters, variations, and advances in the clinical management, as \nwell as other modifiers of disease, which may shift a patient from one \ngroup to another during their lifetime.4\nPatients with transfusional iron overload will require life-long, iron \nchelation therapy to help decrease the iron burden and prevent \nlong-term complications associated with end-organ iron deposition \nincluding hepatic dysfunction and failure, endocrinopathies and cardiac \ndysfunction. Currently, haematopoietic stem cell transplant remains \nthe only option for cure for TDT patients in Malaysia. Promising \nnovel therapies e.g. gene therapy and molecules targeting ineffective \nerythropoiesis are emerging options for thalassaemia patients.\nThe National Thalassaemia Prevention and Control Programme was \napproved by Malaysian Cabinet in 2004. Numerous activities were carried \nout following that namely the establishment of Malaysian Thalassaemia \nRegistry in 2007, formation of National Steering Committee, publication \nof Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Transfusion \nDependent Thalassaemia and establishment of Thalassaemia \nControl and Prevention Programme in 2009. Thalassaemia Screening \nProgramme was introduced with antenatal screening in 2009 which \nmoved on to Form 4 School Screening Programme in 2016 and also \nincludes voluntary and cascade screening.\nThe 2022 Annual Report of Family Health Development Division of \nMoH Malaysia stated that thalassaemia carrier rate was 579.3/10,000",

Eliminating \nexcessive amount of stored iron is crucial in preventing and reversing \niron-mediated organ damage.

Several \nfactors may affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG.\n16.1.\tFacilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitating factors for application of the recommendations in \nthe CPG include:\n•\t wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers\n•\t regular thalassaemia updates nationally according to zones\n•\t National Thalassaemia Steering Committee that oversees the \ndevelopment and implementation of thalassaemia services in \nMalaysia\n•\t established National Thalassaemia Screening Programme\n•\t Malaysia Thalassaemia Registry that captures all thalassaemia \npatients in Malaysia\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG \nare:\n•\t lack of knowledge on thalassaemia and its management among \nhealthcare providers in general\n•\t inadequate coverage of thalassaemia training at all levels of \nhealthcare\n•\t inadequate coverage of national thalassaemia screening programme\n•\t lack of resources for comprehensive management of thalassaemia \nespecially in remote or high thalassaemia burden areas\n•\t lack of awareness, knowledge and understanding on thalassaemia \namong patients, carriers and caregivers\n16.2.\tPotential Resource Implications\nThe recommendations in this CPG require additional resources in terms \nof funds, healthcare infrastructures and human resources/expertise for \ntheir successful implementation as discussed below. The two main \nequally important aspects in thalassaemia management are preventive \nmeasures (including screening) and treatment. Evidence have shown \nthat good screening and prevention programmes effectively reduced \nthe disease burden in the long run.\nDiagnosis of thalassaemia need to be confirmed with molecular test. \nThis is important especially for genetic counselling and genotype-\nphenotype correlation. In Malaysia, only limited centres offer this test \ne.g. Institute of Medical Research, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Hospital \nSultanah Bahiyah and a few university hospitals. These centralised",

Currently, the \nprogramme is unable to achieve full coverage of Form 4 students in the \ncountry. There is also inability to retain information on the carrier status \ndue to lack of proper centralised database. Thus, issues of newborn \nthalassaemia due to unknown parental thalassaemia carrier status \ncontinues despite the existence of the screening programme.\nThere is unequal availability of safe and high-quality blood products in \ncertain states. For example, phenotyping and leucodepletion cannot \nbe done at certain areas due to lack of resources. Lack of blood is a \nproblem unique to Sabah which has the highest burden of thalassaemia. \nImproved networking and co-ordination of blood collection centres in \nother states in Malaysia is crucial to maintain sustainability of blood \nsupply in Sabah.\nEffective iron chelators e.g. DFX is not available to all patients and \ninability to continue its prescription beyond certain periods due to \nbudget constraints is an important problem. Furthermore, monitoring of \niron overload and its complications by MRI T2*, DXA scan and transient \nelastography may not be available in all hospitals. Due to these resource \nlimitations, patients develop complications which require additional \ntreatment and may lead to more costs.\nPrenatal testing is costly. Although diagnostic procedures can be \nperformed in public hospitals, the molecular tests are done in private \nlaboratories for shorter turn-around-time and the cost is borne by the \nfamily.\nImportant issues that receive lack of attention among thalassaemia \npatients are education and employment. School absenteeism among \nthalassaemia patients is high due to regular hospital visits and \nadmissions. Psychological support is important for patients with this \nchronic disease but this maybe lacking due to limitations of the related \nservice.\nSeveral key performance indexes on thalassaemia management being \nmonitored by MOH is in line with the CPG recommendations.
