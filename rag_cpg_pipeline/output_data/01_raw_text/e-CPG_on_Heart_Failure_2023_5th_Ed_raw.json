In recent years, there have been advancements \nin both treatment and diagnostics, to enable all stakeholders in \nhealthcare to improve the management of this condition.\nOver 23 years have passed since the publication of the first \nClinical Practice Guidelines in Malaysia for Heart failure. \nSubsequent editions in 2007, 2014, and 2019 reflected the \ngrowing body of evidence generated both internationally and \nlocally. This latest edition incorporates the latest science in this \nfield.\nI am pleased to see that the goal of management has evolved, from reducing symptoms, \nimproving functional capacity, quality of life and patient survival, to reducing heart failure-     \nrelated hospitalisation, and reducing the socio-economic impact. The paradigm shift is \ntimely to reduce the burden of hospital admissions due to heart failure.\nIn addition, I can see new approaches to managing heart failure, including the introduction \nof early implementation and optimization of foundational heart failure medications, and a \nstructured, multidisciplinary strategy is essential to embark seamless care between \nhospitals and primary care. \nWith 25 key messages and 22 key recommendations, I am sure these guidelines will provide \nall healthcare providers the necessary information that will lead to optimal care of patients \nwith heart failure in Malaysia.\nI congratulate the Writing Committee members who have worked hard to produce these \nguidelines, and I thank all stakeholders who have contributed to its publication. I look \nforward to the active dissemination of the new information, and its translation into clinical \npractice.\nDr Muhammad Radzi Abu Hassan \nDirector-General of Health Malaysia\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH",

            "text": "5\nRATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nCardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Malaysia. Heart \nFailure (HF), the end stage of most diseases of the heart, is a common medical problem \nencountered in primary care and is an important cause of hospital admissions and readmissions \nwith a significant impact on hospital expenditure. As the population ages, the prevalence of \nHF is expected to increase.\nThe 1st Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) in HF was published in 2000 with revisions in \n2007, 2014 and 2019. Since then, there have been many new developments in this field. \nThus, the publication of this 5th edition is timely. This CPG stresses on the early                       \nimplementation and optimization of the “Foundational HF” medications. It also proposes a \nstructured multidisciplinary strategy for the seamless care of patients with HF between \nhospital and primary care.\nThis CPG was drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart Association of \nMalaysia and Ministry of Health. It comprises cardiologists, nephrologists, family medicine \nand general physicians and pharmacists from the government, private sectors, and the \npublic Universities.\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to:\n Critically review the latest scientific evidence, since the last CPG, in the diagnosis and  \n management of HF.\n Incorporate this new evidence in the daily management of our patients and adapt it to  \n our local needs and available resources.\n Develop clinical pathways for HF. \n Establish HF Clinics and provide guidance on step down care of these patients within  \n primary healthcare.\nProcess\nThe last CPG published in 2019 was used as a basis. Apart from addressing previous \nclinical questions that needed to be updated, the Expert Panel also formulated new \nquestions that needed to be addressed. These clinical questions have been divided into \nsections and each member was assigned one or more topics.\nA review of current medical literature on HF from 1st Sept 2018 (the date of the last CPG) till \n31st August 2022 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases - PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.The following \nMedical Subject Headings ( MESH) terms or free text terms were used either singly or in \ncombination:\n“Heart Failure”, “Congestive Cardiac Failure”, “Acute Heart Failure, “Chronic Heart Failure” \n“Right Heart Failure”, “Left Heart Failure” [MeSH], “Heart Failure Reduced Left Ventricular \nFunction”, Heart Failure Preserved Left Ventricular Function” [MeSH], Acute decompensat-\ned heart failure, tachycardio-induced cardiomyopathy, heart failure mid-range, refractory \nheart failure, terminal heart failure, end stage heart failure, cardio-oncology",

The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge list. In \naddition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further \nstudies. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain further information. International \nguidelines on HF - the American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology and \nEuropean Society of Cardiology - were also studied. \nAll literature retrieved was appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all statements \nand recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The grading of evidence \nand the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted from the American College \nof Cardiology / American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology \n(Page10).\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical Advisory \nCommittee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and key health \npersonnel in the major hospitals of the Ministry of Health and the private sector for review \nand feedback.\nClinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated addressing the diagnosis and \ntherapy of HF.\nFor diagnosis: In a person presenting with shortness of breath:\n  What features in the history and clinical examination would make one suspect this  \n  patient is having HF?\n  What diagnostic tests help confirm the clinical suspicion of HF with reasonable sensitivity \n  and specificity?\n   ECG\n   Chest X-ray\n   Natriuretic peptides\n   Echocardiogram\n   Lung ultrasound\nFor therapy, the topics and subtopics were formulated using the Population Intervention \nComparison and Outcome (PICO) method as follows:\nP: Population - Persons with confirmed HF (including both gender and the elderly) and who had:\n  Reduced left ventricular (LV) function (LVEF < 40%) - HFrEF \n  Preserved LV function (LVEF > 50%) - HFpEF \n  Mildly reduced LV function (LVEF: 40-50%) - HFmrEF\n  HF with improved LV function - HFimpEF\n These patients could be:\n  Congested (Volume overload),\n  Hypotensive (Cold) or, \n  Combination of congestion and hypotension.\n The etiology could be: (either singly or in combination)\n  Coronary artery disease\n  Atrial Fibrillation (AF)\n \n Diabetes",

The lack of knowledge of healthcare providers in the: \n   Diagnosis of HF.\n   Management of HF - initial treatment and long-term follow-up.\n   Optimization of therapy and when to refer to tertiary centers.\n 2. Availability of Natriuretic Peptide testing - BNP, NTProBNP - for early diagnosis of HF  \n  in Primary Health Care Clinics.\n 3. Availability of Foundational HF Medications in Primary Health Care Clinics (ARNI - Not  \n  available, SGLT2- available in small quota and only for use in diabetic patients.)\nApplicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThese guidelines were developed considering our local health resources. Blood investigations, \nchest radiographs, ECGs and echocardiograms are common in almost all public health \nfacilities. Most of the drugs used to treat HF - diuretics, ACE-I, ARB, β-blockers have been \napproved for use in Malaysia and available in public hospitals as generics.\nThis guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimize existing \nresources in the timely management of patients with HF.",

This can be done by road shows,  \n  electronic media, and in-house training sessions.\n  Clinical audit by individual hospitals and units to ensure compliance using the suggested \n  performance measures in Section 19, pages 160.\nPeriod of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with recent \ndevelopments and knowledge that is being learnt.\nDr. Jeyamalar Rajadurai\nChairperson",

Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease  \n are common in our patients. \n HF is associated with a huge socio-economic and humanistic burden.\n Most of the costs related to HF are related to re-hospitalizations and inpatient hospital  \n care.\n Important goals of management include:\n  Preventing readmissions thus reducing both the socio-economic and humanistic  \n  burden of the disease.\n  Improving symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life of these patients.\n  Improving patient survival.\n#2: Definition\n HF is a clinical syndrome due to any structural or physiological abnormality of the heart \n resulting in its inability to meet the metabolic demands of the body or its ability to do so  \n only at higher-than-normal filling pressures. \n The diagnosis is made by the presence of characteristic symptoms and/or signs and  \n supported by the findings of either an elevation of natriuretic peptides and/or evidence  \n of pulmonary or systemic congestion.\n#3: Classification & Stages of HF\n HF can be classified according to:\n  Clinical Presentation:\n   Acute heart failure (Acute HF)\n   Chronic heart failure (Chronic HF)\n  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF):\n   Reduced (LVEF ≤ 40%) - Heart failure with reduced ejection function (HFrEF).  \n   Mildly reduced (LVEF 41% - 49%) - Heart Failure with the LVEF being in the  \n   mildly reduced range (HFmrEF).\n   Preserved (LVEF > 50%) - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). \n   Improved Ejection Fraction - HF with an initial baseline LVEF of  ≤ 40%, \n   a ≥ 10-point increase from baseline LVEF following treatment, and a second \n   measurement of LVEF of >40%.(HFimpEF). \n  Stages of HF are:\n   A - “At Risk”\n   B - “Pre HF”\n   C - “Symptomatic HF with previous or current symptoms”\n   D - “End Stage HF”\n The severity of symptomatic HF and the exercise capacity of the patient can be  \n assessed using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class.

Both mechanisms may co-exist in the same patient and depending on the  \n predominant pathophysiology, the patient may present as HFrEF or HFpEF.\n In HFrEF, cardiac output is reduced due to depressed myocardial contractility,  \n irrespective of the etiology.\n In HFpEF, there is impaired left ventricular (LV) filling due to decreased relaxation  \n (during early diastole) and/or reduced compliance (early to late diastole) leading to  \n elevated LV filling pressures at rest or during exercise resulting in dyspnea.\n HFmrEF, is a clinical entity between HFrEF and HFpEF. With regards to etiology, it  \n is more like HFrEF (high prevalence of CAD) but in terms of prognosis, it is like  \n HFpEF.\n In HFimpEF, patients have resolution of symptoms and signs of HF either spontaneously \n or with treatment, but HF is known to frequently relapse especially after withdrawal of  \n pharmacological treatment. These patients have a lower mortality and risk of hospitali \n zation compared to HFrEF and HFpEF.\n# 5: Etiology\n The common underlying causes of HF in adults are:\n  Coronary artery disease (CAD) - accounting for almost 60-66% of HF in Malaysia.\n  Hypertension.\n  Dilated cardiomyopathy - idiopathic, familial.\n  Valvular heart disease - an important cause is rheumatic heart disease (RHD)  \n  among the rural and urban poor.\n  Diabetic cardiomyopathy.\n Comorbidities are common and include hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.\n#6: Prevention of HF\n Prevention and early intervention, wherever appropriate, should be the primary  \n objective of management.\n There is robust clinical data that by appropriate and timely interventions, HF can be  \n prevented, and cardiac function improved.\n It should focus on those who are in:\n  Stage A - “At Risk” - Individuals who are at high risk of developing cardiac disease  \n  but who do not have symptoms or signs of HF and still have structurally normal hearts.\n  Stage B - “Pre HF” - Individuals with structural cardiac disease and who have  \n  either normal or impaired cardiac function but do not, yet, have signs and symptoms  \n  of HF.",

LVEF is a continuous variable and the  \n EF cut-offs used in definitions are therefore arbitrary.\n HFpEF differs from HFrEF in that HFpEF patients are older, more often female with  \n AF, CKD and have more non-CV comorbidities.\n The main hemodynamic finding in HFpEF is an elevation in LV filling pressures i.e.  \n end diastolic LV pressure (LVEDP), initially only on exertion and later even at rest  \n resulting in dyspnea.\n# 14: HF and Diabetes\n HF and diabetes mellitus (DM) often co-exist, each increasing the likelihood of  \n developing the other. Whether this indicates a causal effect or just a comorbidity is still  \n unclear.\n HF per se is associated with a high morbidity and mortality and concomitant DM  \n compounds this risk. This is particularly so in patients with HFpEF.\n# 15: HF and Valvular Heart Disease (VHD)\n VHD is an important cause of HF.\n In the young, RHD is an important cause. The incidence of RHD in rural and urban  \n poor is high.\n In the older population, degenerative valve disease is more common.\n# 16: HF and Cardiomyopathies\n Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of myocardial disorders which  \n  frequently present as HF. \n They can be inherited (familial/genetic) or acquired.\n They are usually classified according to anatomic and physiologic features into: \n  Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)\n  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n  Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)\n  Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy \n  Unclassified cardiomyopathy\n In general, treatment of patients with cardiomyopathy encompasses the Foundational  \n HF Medications as well as etiology-specific therapy (if available).",

HF remains the most  \n common complication among these women regardless of the cause. \n Women with cardiac disease should be assessed:\n  Before conception to assess their risk and to be advised accordingly and\n  Early in the pregnancy to optimize the outcome of the pregnancy.\n Maternal cardiovascular risk can be assessed using the modified World Health  \n Organization (WHO) or NYHA classification. (Appendix XI & XII, page 171-173)\n Level of Care will depend on the maternal CV risk.\n  Low risk: can be managed at their local center after review by a family medicine  \n  specialist/physician or cardiologist.\n  Moderate risk: should be managed at a tertiary center by a multidisciplinary team  \n  with cardiac expertise.\n  High risk: should be referred early to a tertiary center for assessment. \n Patients with LVEF < 30% and those in NYHA Class III and IV should be strongly  \n advised not to get pregnant.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1  Epidemiology of Heart Failure\nHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome and is the end stage of most heart diseases. \nGlobally, it affects more than 60 million individuals and in Asia, the prevalence is estimated \nto be between 1.3% and 6.7%.1 In general, the incidence of HF has stabilized but the \nprevalence appears to be increasing due to the ageing of the population and increasing \nnumber of survivors post myocardial infarction.1-4\nIn Asia, patients with HF are younger with a mean age of 60 years and two-thirds are        \n< 65 years.5 This is 10 to 15 years younger than patients in Europe (71-79 years) and the \nUSA (mean 72 years).6-10 Most of the Asian patients were males and about two-thirds (64%) \nhad 2 or more comorbid conditions such as hypertension (51.9%), coronary artery disease \n(CAD, 50.2%), or diabetes (40.4%).5 There were regional variations but Southeast Asians \n(Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Philippines) had the highest burden of \ncomorbidities, particularly CAD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and chronic kidney \ndisease.11\nIn the ASIAN-HF registry, the 1-year all-cause mortality for the whole population was 9.6%, \nvarying from 4.4% in Japan to 21.4% in Indonesia.11 Southeast Asians had the highest \nmortality (13.6%) compared with South Asians (8.3%) and Northeast Asians (8.9%).11\nIn Malaysia for Acute HF, (see Table 7, page 48), the:11-17\n Median age of patients was 59-64 years. In Thailand, the mean age of patients with HF  \n was 65.3 years.34\n Median length of hospital stay (LOS) was 3-5 days - comparable to that in the US.18 \n In-hospital mortality varied from <3% to as high as 7.5%. In the European Society of  \n Cardiology (ESC) HF-Long term (LT) registry, the in-hospital mortality was 4.9% and in  \n the Get With The Guidelines-HF (GWTG-HF) registry, the in-hospital mortality was <3%.18,19 \n 30-day mortality was high at 11-15%.\n 1-year mortality was also similarly high at 33-49.5%.\n 30-day and 1-year all cause readmission rates were 4-18% and 24-76% respectively  \n compared to the 19% and 53% seen in a meta-analysis of 27 HF registries.20\nIn general, in addition to hospitalizations due to HF, all-cause hospitalizations were also \nincreased and observed in up to 60% of patients.21 In Malaysia, cardiovascular causes \naccounted for half of all 30-day readmissions (50.1%) with HF specifically accounting for \n27.8%.17 Readmission rates were higher in the older age and those with CKD.17 Length of \nstay increased with each hospitalization and the time in between hospitalizations decreased \nwith each subsequent hospitalization.17\nThe prognosis of HF has improved over time, but mortality remains high.1,6-9,22,23 In the \nEuropean Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF-Long term (LT) registry, 1-year mortality was \n23.6% for acute HF and 6.4% for chronic HF between 2011 and 2013.19 In ambulatory \npatients with HF, pooled analysis of cohorts from three North-western European countries, \nshowed that outcomes have significantly improved during the last two decades. (Period \n1:1995-2005 vs period 2: 2006-2015).24 Improvement in all-cause mortality can be \nexplained partly by demographic differences and also by better utilization of Optimal \nMedical Therapy.25",

            "text": "46\n1.2 Socio-Economic Consequences of Heart Failure\nThe socio-economic burden of HF is huge. In high-income countries, 1-2% of the total \nhealthcare expenditure is spent on HF.21 In the US, total cost for HF was estimated to be \n$30.7 billion in 2012, with 68% attributable to direct medical costs.26 A more contemporary \nreview estimated annual healthcare costs for HF patients in the western world, to amount to \n25,000 Euro.1 Most of the costs was linked to inpatient care and re-hospitalizations. In \nMalaysia, in 2014, it was estimated that 3.6% of the GDP is being spent on total healthcare \nwith only 1.8% spent on HF.27 This cost is expected to rise with an ageing and rapidly \nexpanding population.\nThe overall global economic cost of HF is highly variable from country to country.21,28 In \ngeneral, the costs of treatment of a HF patient is higher:28-30\n than other diseases such as asthma, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary  \n diseases, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension.\n in the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease.\nHealthcare costs for HF include:27\n Direct costs - this accounts for 60% of total costs.\n Indirect costs - account for 40%. This includes premature mortality, ‘presenteeism’ (the  \n lost productivity that occurs when employees are not fully functioning in the workplace  \n because of an illness, injury, or other condition), disability, sick absenteeism (short- and  \n medium-term absence from work) and costs of caregiver's absenteeism. \nIn general, in most low and medium economies like Malaysia, the indirect costs of HF in \nterms of premature mortality, morbidity, lost earning potential and unpaid care costs \noutweigh the direct costs.27\nIn Asia, there is substantial variations in healthcare spending. In a non-interventional, \nretrospective study conducted through medical chart audit for the year 2014, the average \ncost of HF hospitalization varied from USD 4,513 in Taiwan to USD 1,443 in public hospitals \nin Malaysia (adjusted to 2015 USD).31 This wide variation in costs could be partly explained \nby the fact that in Malaysia, healthcare is heavily subsidized by the government and the \nwide use of generic medications. There was also less use of more expensive medications \nsuch as Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitors and device therapy.\nIn a costing study on HF conducted in Hospital Queen Elizabeth II, Kota Kinabalu, the mean \nand median annual cost of HF per person were USD 5,428 (MYR 22,649) and USD 591 \n(MYR 2,466) respectively in 2017.32 This is much higher than that seen in the earlier study \nbecause it includes interventional procedures. Inpatient cost accounted for 90.6% of the \ntotal cost and was mainly attributable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) \nprocedures and hospitalization.32\nIn another cost analysis done in 3 public hospitals in Sabah, Kelantan and Pulau Penang \nlooking only at patients with chronic HF from 2016-2018, the mean total cost per HF patient \nper-year (PPPY) was USD 1,971 (MYR 8,224) ± USD 1,255 (MYR 5,236), of which inpatient \ncost accounted for 74.7% of the total cost.33 Medication costs (42.0%) and procedure cost \n(40.8%) contributed to the largest proportion of outpatient and inpatient costs. HF patients \nwith preserved LVEF had the highest mean total cost of PPPY, at USD 2,410 (MYR 10,056) \n± USD 1,226 (MYR 5,115).33",

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nThe main pathophysiology of HF is the inability of the heart to provide sufficient \ncardiac output to meet the perfusion and oxygenation requirements of the body while \nmaintaining normal filling pressures. This may be due to either impaired cardiac \ncontractility or impaired relaxation and compliance. Both mechanisms may co-exist in the \nsame patient and depending on the predominant pathophysiology, the patient may present \nas HFrEF or HFpEF.\nThis will result in the following compensatory mechanisms:\n A higher ventricular end diastolic pressure - This is a compensatory mechanism to \nincrease stroke volume by the Frank Starling mechanism.\n Increasing ventricular volume and wall thickness through ventricular remodelling.\n Neuro-hormonal activation of the: \n  Sympathetic nervous system\n  Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n  Vasopressin\nThis neuro-hormonal activation is aimed at increasing stroke volume and cardiac output by:\n  An increase in heart rate and ventricular contraction. \n  Vasoconstriction of arterial resistance vessels to maintain blood pressure.\n  Venous constriction to increase venous preload. \n  Salt and water retention to increase preload.\nIn general, these neuro-hormonal responses are compensatory mechanisms. However they \ncan also aggravate HF by increasing ventricular afterload and increasing preload to the \npoint where pulmonary and/or systemic congestion and edema occur.",

This leads to a cascade of pathophysiological changes as \noutlined above.  There are effective medical and device therapies that have been shown to \nhave a survival benefit in HFrEF. In this group of patients, their LVEF can remain as < 40% \nor improve to ≥ 40% when they are reclassified as Heart Failure with Improved Ejection \nFraction (HFimpEF).\n4.2 HFpEF\nIn HFpEF there is impaired left ventricular (LV) filling due to decreased relaxation \n(during early diastole) and/or reduced compliance (early to late diastole) leading to \nelevated LV filling pressures at rest or during exercise. These hemodynamic changes are \naccompanied predominantly by signs of pulmonary and/or venous congestion and \noccasionally systemic hypoperfusion as well. \nClinical studies seem to indicate that HFrEF and HFpEF are mechanistically distinct \npathophysiological entities.36 The transition from HFpEF to HFrEF is rare.37\nHFpEF appears to be a multi-organ, systemic syndrome with heterogeneous clinical \nmanifestations and high comorbidity burden.36\nThere is limited data available on therapies that improve survival in HFpEF unlike those with \nHFrEF.

Patients with HF may present differently \nbut tend to be consistent in their presentation whenever they develop a recurrent episode.\n6.1. Symptoms and Signs\nThe clinical suspicion of HF should be supported by objective evidence of cardiac \ndysfunction. Breathlessness with orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), \nreduced exercise tolerance and ankle swelling are the characteristic symptoms of HF. \nOrthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea are markers of high filling pressures and \ncontribute to sleep-disordered breathing.\nSigns which are more specific for HF are an elevated jugular venous pulse (JVP), and a third \nheart sound. These signs are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with HF and \nasymptomatic LV dysfunction.46,47 The presence of a raised JVP, a positive jugulo-venous \nreflux and hepatomegaly generally indicate a raised right atrial pressure of > 8 mmHg.48 A \nraised JVP has a good sensitivity (70%) and specificity (79%) of left sided congestion.48 \nA fourth heart sound is due to atrial contraction and is more frequent in patients with HFpEF. \nIt is absent in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).\nThese signs may be accompanied by a laterally displaced apical impulse and a cardiac \nmurmur. Other supportive signs include peripheral edema, tachycardia, narrow pulse \npressure, pulmonary crepitations, hepatomegaly and ascites. These clinical findings may be \ntransient and resolve completely following initial therapy.\nHowever, these signs are difficult to detect and are not always easily reproducible in the \nelderly, the obese and in patients with chronic lung disease. In a small study on patients with \nchronic HF, signs of congestion (rales, edema and JVP elevation) were absent in 42% of \npatients with a PCWP ≥ 22 mmHg.49 Occasionally symptoms and signs of volume overload \nmay be absent, and the patient may present with fatigue only. \nIn the elderly, as exertional dyspnea increases, they begin to lead more sedentary lives. \nFatigue is common and this is likely due to low cardiac output, peripheral hypo-perfusion \nand skeletal muscle deconditioning and should not be considered due to ageing only.50 \nAtypical symptoms, such as confusion, memory deficit, sleepiness, episodes of delirium, \nirritability, syncopal states, fatigue, anorexia, and reduced level of activity are common \nmanifestations of HF especially after age 80.50 Other co-existing conditions such as \ninfections, anemia, delirium  etc may complicate the clinical picture making the diagnosis of \nHF difficult.51 Bilateral leg edema is common in the elderly and may be due to other causes \nsuch as venous insufficiency, chronic kidney disease or lymphedema besides HF.51\nIn patients presenting with dyspnea, acute LV failure can sometimes mimic an acute           \nexacerbation of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, a proper \nhistory and clinical examination is essential. Similarly, in patients with CKD presenting with \ndyspnea, a concomitant diagnosis of HF may be missed.\nExercise capacity in a patient with heart disease is assessed by the New York Heart Association \n(NYHA) functional classification.

Those who are overweight  \n  and with class 1 obesity have 38% and 56% higher risk of HFpEF, respectively,  \n  independent of other CV risk factors.89,90\n  However, there exists an obesity paradox in HF - Patients with overweight or class 1  \n  obesity have better clinical outcomes than patients with normal weight for similar  \n  degrees of HF.90\n  Metabolic Syndrome - After adjusting for other risk factors for HF, the presence of  \n  metabolic syndrome at baseline was also a strong predictor of the development of  \n  subsequent HF.91,92",

Exercise training-see also Section 16 - HF Rehabilitation\nSeveral systematic reviews and meta-analyses support exercise training as an integral \npart of the non-pharmacological treatment of HF.163-169 Exercise also leads to an \nimprovement in the patient’s Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) - symptoms, a greater \nsense of wellbeing, and better functional capacity.163 \nExercise training:\n Is safe in patients with stable HF.163-170\n In patients with HFrEF, has been shown to reduce overall and HF-specific hospitalizations.163-169\n In patients with HFpEF has limited clinical data.

These include:172\n Aerobic and endurance training - Moderate intensity continuous exercises such as walking, \n treadmill, stationary bicycle as well as swimming with a target goal of 5 days per week, 30  \n minutes per session. \n Interval training and high intensity interval training (HIIT) - This has been shown to be safe  \n and results in greater improvements in exercise tolerance in selected patients with HF. In  \n a trial on patients with HFpEF, however, HIIT did not confer any advantage compared to  \n guideline based physical exercise.173\n Inspiratory muscle  muscle training (IMT) - the addition of IMT has been shown to reduce  \n dyspnea, improve exercise time and HRQoL. \n8.3 Diet and nutrition\nIt has been widely accepted that sodium intake should be restricted in patients with HF \nespecially in those with symptoms. However, there is little clinical evidence to support \nthis.174-176 Sodium restriction to < 100gm/day did not reduce clinical events.175\n \nThe current recommendation is to avoid adding salt and flavouring sauces such as \nsoya sauce, tomato ketchup and chilli sauce while cooking or at the table. Refer to \nAppendix II, Page 162-163 on salt content of common Malaysian food.  \nA good balanced diet plays an important role in preventing energy depletion which can lead \nto cardiac cachexia and malnutrition.

(Section 10.2)\n9.3.1.1 Conversion to oral therapy\nFollowing adequate response to intravenous therapy, the patient should be converted to \noptimal oral medications. If the LVEF < 40%, they should be initiated on Foundational HF \nmedications (RAS blockers, β-blockers, MRA and SGLT2-i) as outlined below.\n Diuretics 48 \n  Oral diuretics may be commenced following resolution of symptoms of \n  congestion and the patient achieving his “dry weight”.\n  The initial dose of oral diuretics required is generally higher than the intravenous  \n  dose.298 A reasonable guide is to use a mg-to-mg i.v. to oral conversion. \n  In patients who are suspected to have diuretic resistance, bumetanide may be considered \n  as it is better absorbed.254\n  The dose of diuretics at discharge needs to be individualized. \n  Many patients are discharged with residual clinical congestion, and this is a strong  \n  predictor of readmission.299,300\n  Residual clinical congestion is often difficult to assess. Absence of dyspnea, peripheral  \n  edema, the amount of fluid lost during i.v. diuretic therapy and the patient achieving his  \n  “dry weight” are inadequate signs to assess decongestion.48,299,301 This is further  \n  compounded by the inter-individual variation in the amount of fluid retention that can  \n  precipitate symptoms.299\n  Determining the most appropriate outpatient dose of diuretic can be difficult and  \n  requires careful follow-up, particularly early in the post-discharge period.48\n  It would be prudent to discharge the patient on the same dose of oral diuretics as  \n  the individual was on as in - patient and then only cautiously reduce the dose in  \n  the post  discharge period after careful assessment of the patient’s congestion  \n  status.\n MRA302-304\n  These can be commenced within 24-48 hours of admission.48 \n  Renal function and potassium levels need to be monitored.\n Renin Angiotensin System Blockers (RAS blockers)-Angiotensin Converting  \n Enzyme  Inhibitor (ACE-I) or Angiotensin Receptor blockers (ARB)305,306 \n  Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) Blockers may be commenced at admission if  \n  the initial BP is adequate.

These are:\n Diuretics\n Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers:\n  Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors305,306,329,330 or \n  Angiotensin receptor blockers331-334 or\n  Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor335\n β-blockers307-313\n Mineralocorticoid Antagonists (MRA)302-304\n Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i)127,336-343\n Diuretics, by relieving congestion, are the initial step in the management of patients with  \n symptomatic HF. \n The other four medications (RAS blockers, β-blockers, MRA and SGLT2-i) have been  \n shown to improve survival, reduce hospitalizations for HF and improve quality of life in  \n patients with HFrEF. SGLT2-i has been shown to be effective irrespective of diabetic  \n status.340-342 For these reasons, these 4 medications are referred to as “Foundational  \n HF” Medications.\n The initiation and up titration of these 4 Foundational drug classes should be guided by  \n the patient’s:\n  Clinical status,\n  Heart rate, \n  Blood pressure, \n  Fluid overload status, \n  Renal function, \n  Electrolytes and \n  Tolerance. \n Comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, chronic kidney, and pulmonary disease  \n are also important conditions to be considered.\n These 4 Foundational HF Medications should be initiated at about the same time and  \n up titrated if needed to their target or maximally tolerated doses. \n  In general, starting low doses of the 4 different classes would be preferred over up  \n  titration of each of the individual drugs to the maximally tolerated dose before initiating  \n  the next drug. \n  These drugs are preferably all initiated, albeit at low doses, when the patient is  \n  admitted with HF so that at the time of discharge, the patient is on all the “Foundational  \n  HF” Medications. \n These drugs should be “up titrated” as outpatient to the maximally tolerated dose  \n according to the patient’s profile - hemodynamic and renal function.

            "text": "89\n Drugs with less proven survival benefits (e.g., diuretics) should be re-evaluated for  \n reduction in dosage when Foundation HF medications are not well tolerated due to a  \n low BP. If the patient is no longer congested and appears clinically to be euvolemic,  \n the doses of diuretics can be reduced. Alternatively, administering drugs at different  \n timing may be considered for those with symptomatic hypotension.\n Wherever possible, Foundational HF medications should be continued during an acute  \n illness. If discontinued, they should be restarted as soon as the condition has stabilized. \n10.1.1 Diuretics (Table 15, page 90)\n Diuretics are indicated in all patients in whom there are signs and/or symptoms \n of congestion to alleviate symptoms, improve exercise capacity, and decrease \n hospitalizations for HF.344,345\n The goal is to achieve and maintain euvolemia with the lowest dose of a diuretic.  \n Euvolemia is, however, often difficult to assess clinically. Important features to look for  \n clinically are:345\n  Resolution of symptoms and signs of congestion - subclinical congestion is sometimes,  \n  however, difficult to detect.\n  Improvement in effort tolerance and walking distance.\n Other useful investigative tools which may be helpful to assess euvolemia, if available,  \n include: \n  Chest X-ray - this is a specific but not a very sensitive indicator of volume status.346,347\n  Echocardiographic parameters - such as:\n   Decrease in chamber sizes.\n   Decrease in the diameter of the IVC and a 50% decrease with inspiration.\n   Normalization or at least a decrease in doppler indices of LV and RV filling pressures. \n  Natriuretic peptides - These may, however, be persistently elevated in patients with  \n  Chronic HF and in addition, there is biological variability. A decrease in levels compared\n  to admission would be a helpful guide although relying on this alone can lead to a false  \n  assurance that decongestion has been achieved.48\n  Lung ultrasound (LUS) - In a small study, tailored LUS-guided diuretic treatment of  \n  pulmonary congestion reduced the number of decompensations and improved walking  \n  capacity in patients with HF.348 \n Most of these investigative tools-such as echocardiographic parameters and natriuretic  \n peptides - measure filling pressures and not volume status. These tests, however, may  \n sometimes be insufficient to detect subclinical volume excess without accompanying  \n increases in filling pressures.349\n The dose of diuretic used is variable and dependent on individual requirements. In the  \n presence of:\n  Severe congestive HF and ADHF, oral diuretic therapy may be ineffective. Intravenous \n  therapy may be preferred. The diuretic of choice in these patients with fluid overload  \n  is a loop diuretic i.e., furosemide. The goal is a reduction of body weight of about  \n  1kg/day. \n  Mild fluid retention, thiazide diuretics may be preferred especially in the presence  \n  of co-existing hypertension. Thiazides, however, are weak diuretics.\n For most patients however, a loop diuretic is often required. Other Foundational HF  \n Medications - ARNI, MRAs, and SGLT2-i - also have diuretic characteristics and this  \n may help modify the dose of the diuretic.350-353\nI,B",

Hypokalemia  \n is a common problem with diuretic use and oral potassium supplementation is usually  \n necessary.\n Patients should be educated in ‘dry weight’ management and advised to record their  \n daily weight. If there is a consistent increase in weight of more than 2kg in 3 days,  \n patients  should be educated to self-adjust their diuretic (furosemide) dose together \n with restriction  of their fluid intake until their “dry weight” is regained. However, if  \n the weight increase is  associated with worsening symptoms or the patient fails to  \n respond to these measures, the patient should seek medical help immediately.\n Diuretic therapy may be reduced as the clinical condition of the patient improves and they  \n are assessed to have attained euvolemia using the indicators listed earlier. In one study,  \n however, these indicators had limited predictive capability to determine down titration  \n success/failure.349 \n In selected patients who have stable symptoms and have been taught to manage their  \n volume status and modify their diuretic dose accordingly, diuretic therapy may be discontinued.\n This is more likely to succeed if their LVEF improves to above 40-45%.

If patients are on large doses of diuretics, the  \n BP and renal function should be monitored.\n Start with a low dose. The dose should be increased gradually to the target dose  \n (Flowchart III & IV, pages 37-38, Table 3, page 93) or the maximum tolerated dose.\n Orthostatic hypotension should be avoided. Wherever possible, the BP should be  \n measured in the lying and standing position.  The consensus definition of orthostatic  \n hypotension is a reduction of systolic BP of at least 20 mm Hg or a reduction of diastolic  \n BP of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of erect standing.358 In the elderly, the presence \n of orthostatic hypotension should be interpreted cautiously due to both its high prevalence  \n in this population and its low association with underlying pathology directly related to  \n volume status.345\n Renal profile should be checked periodically. Serum creatinine may increase up to 30%  \n (or estimated Glomerular Filtrate Rate (eGFR) may decrease by 25%) from baseline at  \n 7-14 days, after introduction of either an ACE-I or an ARB.359 Dose adjustments is not  \n required if the increase in serum creatinine stabilizes at < 30% (or eGFR reduces < 25%)  \n and serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/l. The renal function should however be monitored  \n periodically on a regular basis.  Other causes of deteriorating renal function such as  \n infection, drug therapies or worsening HF should be excluded.\n There is no significant difference in rates of hypotension, hyperkalemia, or renal dysfunction \n between ACE-Is and ARBs. \n ACE-I intolerance denotes the presence of a bothersome cough (most commonly, 5% -  \n 20% although it can be as high as 64.9%) or the experience of angioedema (uncommon,  \n < 1%) with ACE-I therapy.360,361 Patients with these conditions may be switched to an ARB, \n although, some may still develop angioedema.362,363 \n Routine combined use of both ACE-I and an ARB should be avoided, as this combination  \n causes more adverse effects (hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction).364,365\n10.1.2.2. ARNI \n ARNI is a combination of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a neprilysin  \n inhibitor (an  enzyme that degrades natriuretic peptides-bradykinin, adrenomedullin, and  \n other vasoactive peptides). The only drug in this class is sacubitril/valsartan. \n ARNI has been shown to improve symptoms, reduce HF hospitalizations and  \n increase  survival in patients with HFrEF who have previously tolerated ACE-I.335,366 \n ARNI has also been shown to be safe in patients who are ACEI-naive and in hospitalized  \n patients who have just recovered from Acute HF.315\n ARNI is recommended as a replacement to ACE-I in patients with HFrEF who  \n remain  symptomatic despite OMT. It has been shown to decrease CV death, HF  \n hospitalizations, and symptoms.335 The benefit of ARNI over an ACE-I, was consistent  \nI,A\nIIa,B\nI,A\nI,B\nI,B\nIII,A",

Laboratory  \n monitoring is also similar.\n The use of ARNI is, however, associated with hypotension but a low incidence of  \n angioedema.\n When initiating an ARNI, the initial dosing and rate of titration:\n  Is dependent on pre-existing treatment, hemodynamic profile, and associated comorbidities.  \n  It should be individualized.\n  Should not be initiated if systolic BP < 100mmHg and used with caution if eGFR \n  < 30 mL/min/1.73m2. \n  When switching from ACEI to ARNI, a washout period of at least 36 hours is required  \n  to decrease the risk of angioedema.\n  No washout period is required for conversion between ARB and ARNI.\n The drug should be up titrated to the target or maximally tolerated dose shown to improve  \n important HF outcomes. \n Among patients with HFrEF, similar improvement in prognostic biomarkers, health status,  \n and cardiac remodeling were observed across various ARNI doses - average daily dose:  \n 112 mg in Tertile 1 (low dose), 342 mg in Tertile 2 (moderate dose), and 379 mg in Tertile  \n 3 (high dose).369\n In patients taking ARNI, NT-Pro BNP is a more reliable biomarker than BNP. BNP levels  \n may be spuriously elevated as the drug prevents its breakdown.\n10.1.3 β-blockers (Table 3, page 94)\n In major clinical trials, β-blockers, on top of standard therapy, have been shown to  \n improve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations and improve survival in patients with HFrEF,  \n regardless of their NYHA Functional class.307-313,370-372 \n All patients with HFrEF should be on β-blockers unless there is a \n contraindication.307-313,370-372\n Objective improvement in cardiac function might not, however, be apparent for 6-12  \n months after β-blocker initiation. Hence, early initiation of β-blockers for all stable patients  \n with current or prior symptoms of HF upon diagnosis is warranted, unless contraindicated. \n When initiating a β-blocker, the patient should be in a non-congested state ie. out of  \n Acute HF and preferably euvolemic with clear lung fields. Caution should be exercised  \n when initiating β-blockers in a patient in NYHA class III-IV.\n Patients who decompensate and are admitted in Acute HF should be maintained on  \n the same dose of β-blockers unless the clinical condition (hypotension or significant  \n bradycardia) warrants a temporary stopping or reduction in the dose.314\n After the patient has been stabilized, an attempt should be made to titrate to the target or  \n maximum tolerated dose. \n The contraindications for β-blocker use include:\n  Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block (without a pacemaker).\n  Bronchial asthma (relative contraindication - use with caution).\n  Symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension.\n  Critical limb ischemia.\nIIa,B\nIIa,B\nIIa,B\nI, A\nI, A",

This  \n combination has been shown to improve survival in the African American population with  \n HF.391,392\n10.1.9.  Digoxin\n In patients with HF, digoxin may be considered in the following situations:\n  To relieve symptoms and lower the risk of hospitalization in patients with symptomatic  \n  HFrEF and already on OMT with an ACE-I (or ARB), a β-blocker and an MRA.393-395 It  \n  has no survival benefit.\n  Rate control in patients with AF.396-398\n Where rate control is the preferred strategy, β-blocker alone or in combination with digoxin  \n was associated with a similar decrease in the risk of mortality.396-398\n Digoxin alone was associated with an increase in mortality.399,400 \n Digoxin may be considered in patients with HF and AF in the following situations:397,398\n  Rate control is inadequate on β-blockers alone.\n  β-blockers are contraindicated.\n  Rapid control of the ventricular rate with parenteral drugs is required. \n Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range and thus close monitoring of renal function and  \n serum electrolytes (particularly potassium and magnesium levels) is required, prior to  \n initiation of digoxin and periodically during its use. \n No loading dose is required for the management of chronic HF. Lower doses of digoxin  \n and lower levels of serum digoxin (0.5-0.8ng/ml or 0.65 to 1nmol/L) are efficacious and  \n appear adequate in most patients with compensated HF.401-403 The maintenance dose of  \n digoxin may range between 0.0625mg to 0.25mg daily, which may be lower in elderly  \n patients, women, and those with renal impairment. \n Regular monitoring of digoxin levels is not required other than to assess for toxicity  \n as the levels should not be used to guide dose adjustment in chronic therapy. Digoxin  \n levels may be elevated in the presence of worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalance  \n (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcemia) or interacting drugs (e.g., amiodar  \n one), which may lead to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias particularly in the presence of  \n hypokalemia. \n10.1.10.

Etiology and Associated Comorbidities\n HFpEF may also share similar clinical characteristics with valvular heart disease, pericardial \n disease, and high-output HF. In all these conditions, patients present with HF and have  \n normal LVEF and even normal LV dimensions. In HFpEF however, the HF is due to  \n myocardial disease resulting in abnormal myocardial relaxation, decreased compliance,  \n and increased filling pressure.539 For this reason, a basic echocardiogram is essential in  \n the initial work up of these patients. \n The etiological factors affecting HFpEF and HFrEF seem to be different. When compared  \n to patients with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF are more likely to have hypertension,  \n valvular heart disease (e.g., aortic stenosis) and AF and are less likely to have a MI or left  \n bundle branch block.540 \n Comorbidities play an important role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF. These contribute  \n to systemic and endomyocardial inflammation with fibrosis which are important in the  \n pathogenesis of the disease.524 It is these comorbidities that primarily correlate with  \n outcome in patients with HFpEF rather than NP levels or echocardiographic parameters.541\n  Hypertension remains the most prevalent comorbidity of HFpEF, with a prevalence of  \n  60% to 89%.542-544\n  Other comorbidities include :542-544\n   Overweight or obesity- Obesity is not only a comorbidity, but it is also an important  \n   risk factor for HFpEF development. The mechanisms involved are complex and  \n   include neurohormonal mechanisms and oxidative stress.545 Morbid obesity also has  \n   an adverse effect on cardiac remodeling.545\n   Diabetes mellitus (DM)\n   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n   Anemia\n   Coronary artery disease (CAD)\n   Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n  The presence of diabetes, a lower systolic BP, lower hemoglobin and a lower eGFR  \n  were associated with a poorer outcome.541 \n  AF is common in HFpEF and increases the risk of adverse outcomes.546\n13.3 Management (Table 6, page 44)\nCompared with HFrEF patients, hospitalizations, and deaths in patients with HFpEF are \nmore likely to be due to non-cardiovascular causes. As LVEF increases, the proportional \ncontribution of non-cardiac and non-HF events to death or hospitalization increases, \nhighlighting the importance of managing comorbidities.\nThe important aim of therapy is to alleviate symptoms, improve well-being and reduce \nhospitalizations. Screening for comorbidities and treating these appropriately is important. \n13.3.1 Lifestyle measures\n Overweight or obesity are important comorbidities in HFpEF. \n  A caloric restriction diet is feasible and safe in older, obese patients with HFpEF.

Prevention of HF \n Diabetes is a CVD defining disease, and patients should have their other CV risk factors  \n treated aggressively and closely monitored.322\n Lifestyle measures are important and have been shown to lower risk for HF, particularly         \n in patients with HFpEF.608 These include:322\n  Weight reduction, \n  Increased physical activity; and\n  Smoking cessation.\n The BP and LDL-C should be treated to target:322\n  BP 130-139/70-79mmHg, SBP < 130 in those without pre-existing CAD (but not < 120  \n  mmHG) and who are at a higher risk of CKD or stroke.\n  LDL-C according to CV risk category. \n Ambulatory or home BP monitoring should be encouraged as undetected hypertension  \n and masked hypertension is highly prevalent among patients with DM.609 \n In asymptomatic patients, routine screening for CAD is not recommended. Routine  \n screening does not improve outcomes if CV risk factors are not treated to target.322\n14.1.6.2.  Treatment of HF\n The treatment of both Acute and Chronic HF in patients with DM is similar to those without  \n DM with the use of the Foundational HF medications.\n14.1.6.3.  Treatment of Diabetes -Glucose Lowering Agents\n Intensive glucose lowering is not associated with any significant reduction in CV risk.610  \n In fact, tight control of DM especially with the occurrence of hypoglycemia is associated  \n with increased mortality.611-613 \n In addition, HbA1c variability, has been shown to be an independent risk factor for CVD in  \n T2DM patients, even when the HbA1c is within the target range.614 \n Glycemic targets for patients with DM and HF should be individualized to include consid \n erations of comorbidities, severity of HF, and to balance benefits versus potential  \n risks.322,605\nI,A\nI,B\nI,A\nI,A\nI,A\nI,B\nIIb,B",

Supraventricular Arrhythmias\nAny supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a rapid ventricular response may induce HF. \nCommonly encountered SVTs in clinical practice include:\n Incessant atrial tachycardia (AT), \n Very frequent episodes of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and \n Atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT). \nArrhythmia-induced Cardiomyopathy has been reported in 10% of patients with AT, and as \nhigh as 37% of patients with incessant AT.688,690\nSuccessful treatment, usually via electrophysiological study and radiofrequency ablation, \ncould potentially restore LV function.416\nI,A\nI,A\nI,C\nI,C",

Most anti-arrhythmic drugs  \n are however contraindicated in the presence of HF.\n Catheter ablation - This has a higher chance of achieving rhythm control in patients with  \n AF than anti-arrhythmic drugs.437 Catheter ablation has been shown to reduce the risk of  \n death and HF hospitalization in patients with AF and HF when compared to standard  \n therapy with anti-arrhythmic drugs.692,693 The success of the procedure and benefits seen  \n were more likely in patients who underwent the procedure within 1 year of diagnosing AF.692\n14.4.1.4.

Factors increasing maternal and fetal risks include:757-761\n Previous cardiac events\n NYHA class III to IV or\n LVEF < 40%.  \nIn the ROPAC Registry, women with pre-pregnancy or peripartum cardiomyopathy had the \nhighest mortality rate (2.4%)762,763\nNormal hemodynamic changes that occur in pregnancy are: \n An increase in cardiac output by 30-50% during normal pregnancy. \n An increase in cardiac output to 80% above baseline during labour and delivery. \n Hemodynamic changes return to baseline 2-4 weeks after vaginal delivery and up to 6  \n weeks after Caesarean delivery.\nIn women with heart disease, these changes may have a deleterious effect on their \ncardiovascular system and may precipitate HF. \nThe periods of greatest risk for cardiac events during pregnancy are early third trimester, at \ndelivery and in the immediate post partum period.",

ADVANCED HEART FAILURE\n15.1.  Heart Transplant\nHeart transplantation is well-established for refractory end stage HF. It is the gold standard \nfor the treatment of advanced HF in the absence of contraindications. World-wide the 1-year \nsurvival rate is 91% and the median survival post-transplant is 12 to 13 years.842\nThis definitive therapy for HF is however limited by the lack of donor organs.843 To address \nthis, worldwide, efforts are being made to increase this organ donor shortage by increasing \nthe donor age limit criteria, improving donor recovery strategies and being more stringent in \nthe selection criteria.155,843\nAll patients with severe symptomatic HF despite OMT and no other alternative therapeutic \noptions should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist \nhospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispecialty, multidisciplinary team and \nappropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalizations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or peak oxygen  \n uptake) < 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2 max is the maximum rate of oxygen  \n consumption measured during incremental exercise i.e. exercise of increasing intensity.  \n This is widely used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable, and compliant with therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant:\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver, or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\nI,A",

Frequency of follow-up \nThis will depend on:\n The patient’s clinical stability and \n Need for pharmacotherapy optimization. \nA patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should \nideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of \nfollow-up would be determined by the local organization of care and resources.\n17.3.

OTHER THERAPIES FOR HEART FAILURE\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing \napproaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Center for \nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative \nmedicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, \nproducts, or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n18.1.  Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.894-898 Data seem to \nindicate that there is improved functional status, walk distance, and symptoms and NYHA \nFunctional class.896-897 There is however, concern that it could precipitate or exacerbate \nsymptoms in those with a history of HF.898 \n18.2.  Stem cell therapy\nStem cells, which are derived from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood, have been infused \ninto the coronary arteries or injected directly into the myocardium. The original hypothesis \nwas that stem cells would engraft in the myocardium and replace damaged cardiomyocytes. \nSubsequent research has suggested that stem cells probably do not differentiate into \nfunctional cardiomyocytes, but as an alternative hypothesis, it was hoped that they might \nhave paracrine effects that would benefit myocardial function. \nThere is still limited knowledge on the optimal cell type, dosing, route of administration, \npatient parameters, patient safety, and other important variables that contribute to successful \nstem cell therapy. There is, however, still a lot of research left to do into the effectiveness \nand safety of these interventions.899-901\n \n18.3.  Omega 3 fatty acids\nThis may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to standard HF therapy, based on \nobservations and clinical trials which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalizations \nespecially among diabetics.902-907 \n18.4.  Coenzyme Q10\nThere is some evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all-cause mortality and \nhospitalization for HF. However there still needs to be further research to determine the role \nof Coenzyme Q10 in patients with HF, the optimal dose, and the duration of Coenzyme Q10 \nsupplementation.908-910\n18.5.  Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 minute walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.911-914 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalization, MI and mortality is not \nknown. \n18.6.  Yoga\nYoga improves peak VO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.915 In \naddition, it has been reported to reduce cardiovascular events, morbidity, and mortality \nalthough the evidence supporting these conclusions is somewhat limited.916",

Suggestive criteria include:16\n Septal e’:\n \n  Major Criterion: e’ < 7 cm/s; or lateral e’ < 10 cm/s (subjects aged < 75 years)\n \n  Major Criterion: e’ < 5 cm/s; or lateral e’ < 7 cm/s (subjects aged ≥ 75 years)\n Average Septal-Lateral E/e’ Ratio: - The E/e’ index cannot be recommended as a single  \n \ndiagnostic index above all other non-invasive measures of filling pressures (such as retrograde  \n \npulmonary venous flow).16\n \n  Major Criterion:  ≥ 15 -This has good diagnostic value for identifying a high mean pulmonary  \n \n \ncapillary wedge pressure rest has (mPCWP) supporting the likelihood of HFpEF\n \n  Minor Criterion: 9 -14 - This is less sensitive in identifying a high mPCWP.\n Tricuspid Regurgitant (TR) Peak Velocity \n \n  Major Criterion: > 2:8m/s\n Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure - This is estimated 4x peak TR velocity plus estimated right  \n \natrial pressure.\n \n  Major Criterion: > 35mmHg\n Left Atrial Volume Index: This is an indirect correlate of LV filling pressures. It is more accurate  \n \nas a marker of chronic LA remodelling than either LA area or diameter.\n \n  Major Criterion: > 34mL/m2 - in sinus rhythm\n \n  Major Criterion: > 40mL/m2 - in atrial fibrillation\n \n  Minor Criterion: 29-34mL/m2 - in sinus rhythm\n \n  Minor Criterion: 34-40mL/m2 - in atrial fibrillation\n Left Ventricular Mass Index and Relative Wall Thickness (RWT)\n \n  Major Criterion: LVMI ≥ 149 g/m2 in men or ≥ 122 g/m2 in women and RWT > 0:42\n \n  Minor Criterion: LVMI ≥ 115 g/m2 in men or ≥ 95 g/m2 in women or RWT > 0:42 or \n \n \nLV end-diastolic wall thickness ≥ 12mm\nScoring System Based on Echocardiographic and Natriuretic Peptide Levels:\nFor each major criterion met, 2 points are awarded, and 1 point is awarded for a minor criterion. \n A score of ≥ 5  \nis diagnostic of HFpEF. \n A score of ≤ 1  \nmakes a diagnosis of HFpEF very unlikely.\n A score of 2-4  \nmakes the diagnosis uncertain and additional work up is recommended.",
