            "text": "MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n2\nNearly 30 years since the publication of the first Malaysian \nConsensus on management of hyperlipidaemia, I am proud to \nannounce the publication of the 6th Clinical Practice Guidelines \n(CPG) on the management of dyslipidemia. Since the 5th CPG, \npublished in 2017, there has been much development in both \ndiagnosis and treatments of dyslipidemia. This CPG is timely, as \nMalaysia has seen a rise in the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia        \nin adults - a rise of 31.5% in 2011 to 38.1% in 2019.\nDyslipidemia remains one of the most deadly of the established \ncardiovascular risk factors. Compared to cigarette smoking, hypertension \nand diabetes, dyslipidemia is often only diagnosed when patients develop \ntheir first acute vascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke. Therefore, with the advent \nof such new therapeutics now available, with accompanying safety and efficacy clinical data, \nthis CPG is timely to enable all healthcare professionals to optimise the management of their \npatients with dyslipidemia.\nThis CPG comes with 13 new key messages and 19 key recommendations, valuable \nadditions from the last CPG. The main aims of this 2023 CPG are to reduce the level of \nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), introduce new medications that can be used, in particularly \nfor secondary preventions; and new updates in the Medical Nutrition therapy section. A \nsignificant reduction the LDL-C targets will see a corresponding reduction in serious cardiovascular \noutcomes. Improved point-of-care diagnostics will lead to more of the population to be \ndiagnosed with dyslipidemia, and an aggressive, multi-aspect management plan being \nformulated, and administered, to each individual.\nI would like to thank the Chairperson of the Writing Committee - Dr Jeyamalar Rajadurai - \nand her colleagues, and all those who contributed towards the publication of this CPG.\nI am certain that, with its dissemination, the burden of cardiovascular disease attributed to \ndyslipidemia, will be attenuated, and its deadly manifestations in the form of acute vascular \nevents can be mitigated. For a condition so prevalent in Malaysia, this CPG will be a \nvaluable resource from healthcare professionals practising at primary to tertiary care \ncentres, and provide useful guidance to all stakeholders, so that this multidisciplinary \napproach will translate to improved health outcomes for both patients, and the population as \na whole.\nDr Muhammad Radzi Abu Hassan \nDirector-General of Health Malaysia\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH",

            "text": "MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n5\nRationale:\nIn Malaysia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the leading cause of death in both men and \nwomen till 2021.3,4 CVD includes coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease \nand peripheral arterial disease.\n \nThe prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors - dyslipidemia, hypertension, \ndiabetes, smoking and overweight/obesity - has been on an increasing trend.5,7,8 Malaysians \ndevelop heart disease at a younger age when compared to people in Thailand, mainland \nChina and western countries.10 Our local NCVD-ACS Registry (2018-2019) showed that \nmost patients (93.5%) had at least one established CV risk factor-hypertension (61.9%), \ndyslipidemia (36.7%) or diabetes (44.2%).10 About 40.3% (2 persons out of 5) had ≥ 3 CV \nrisk factors.10\nIn preventing CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing the individual’s global CV risk. This \nClinical Practice Guideline (CPG) is on management of dyslipidemia. The last CPG (5th \nedition) was published in 2017. Thus, the need for an update.\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this clinical practice guidelines are to review:\n The clinical evidence linking dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis and determining which  \n \nlipid parameters should be targeted.\n Strategies for assessing CV risk that is most applicable to our local population.\n Evidence based management of dyslipidemia that translates to CV benefits, utilizing  \n \nexisting healthcare resources wherever possible.\nProcess:\nThis CPG has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart Association \nof Malaysia, Ministry of Health and the Academy of Medicine. It comprises cardiologists, \nendocrinologists, general physicians, pharmacists and dieticians from the government and \nprivate sectors as well as from the Universities.\nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic databases - PubMed and \nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. The following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) \nterms or free text terms were used either singly or in combination:\n“Hyperlipidemia”; “Dyslipidemia”; “Hypercholesterolemia”; “Cholesterol”; “LDL-Cholesterol” \n“HDL-Cholesterol”; “Triglycerides”; Diabetic dyslipidemia”\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans, and published in the \nEnglish language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge list. In \naddition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further \nstudies. The search was conducted from 31st August 2016 (date of last review for previous \nCPG) till 31st August 2022.\nLocal guidelines were also studied. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain further \ninformation. International guidelines mainly that from the American Heart Association/ \nAmerican College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology were \nused as main references.\nRATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT",

The group members met several times throughout the \ndevelopment of the guideline. All retrieved literature was appraised by individual members \nand subsequently presented for discussion during group meetings. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated were agreed collectively by members of the Expert Panel. \nWhere the evidence was insufficient the recommendations were derived by consensus of \nthe Panel. The draft was then sent to local external reviewers for comments. \nThe level of recommendation and the grading of evidence used in this guideline was \nadapted from the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology \n(ACC/ESC) and outlined on pg. 9.

The use of non-fasting samples to assess lipid  \n  profile simplifies workflow and makes it easier for patients.\n \n Almost all the medications recommended are approved for use in Malaysia and  \n  available in public hospitals. Potent statins and ezetimibe are available as  \n  generics in the government formulary.\n \n These guidelines aim to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimize  \n  existing resources in the management of dyslipidemia.\nFacilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barriers for successful implementation of this CPG are the lack of knowledge of the: \n \n role of cholesterol (especially LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of CVD. \n \n benefits of total cholesterol (especially LDL-C) lowering.\n \n long-term safety profile of pharmacotherapy among both healthcare professionals  \n  and the public.\n \n Lack of knowledge of the benefits and safety of the very low levels of LDL-C \n \n  recommended for individuals in secondary prevention.\nImplementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical governance. \nTo ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n \n Increasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the importance \n \n  of knowing their individual CV risk.\n \n Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on CV risk assessment  \n  tools and the implementation of appropriate preventative strategies depending on  \n  everyone’s CV risk status. This can be done by road shows, electronic media, and in  \n  house training sessions.\n \n  Clinical audit by individual hospitals, units, and general practices to ensure compli \n  ance using the suggested performance measures in Section 14, pg. 87-88.\n \nDr. Jeyamalar Rajadurai\nChairperson",

This is almost 10 years younger than that seen in Singapore.\n The prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors among adults > 18 years  \n has been on an increasing trend.\n About 40% of patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome have >3 CV risk factors.\nKey Message #2: Measurement of Lipids and Apolipoproteins\n A standard lipid profile includes measurement of Plasma or serum total cholesterol (TC),  \n LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) and Triglycerides (TG).\n TC, HDL-C and TG are measured directly from the serum and LDL-C is calculated  \n using the Friedwald’s equation provided TG < 4.5mmol/l.\nKey messages #3: Classification of Dyslipidemia\n Dyslipidemias may be primary due to genetic disorders or secondary to nephrotic  \n syndrome, cholestatic liver disease, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, drugs,  \n alcoholism, and insulin resistance states such as Type 2 diabetes and metabolic  \n syndrome.\nKey Messages #4: Dyslipidemia as a CV Risk Factor\n LDL-C:\n  This has been shown to be an important causative factor in the development of  \n  atherosclerotic vascular disease based on numerous epidemiological, genetic and  \n  clinical interventional trials.\n  Based on the Malaysian NCVD-ACS Registry 2018-2019:\n   The prevalence of dyslipidemia among individuals admitted with ACS was 36.7%.\n   The mean LDL-C on admission was 3.1mmol/l in males and 3.0mmol/l in females.\n Non-HDL-C:\n  Reflects the concentration of cholesterol within all lipoprotein particles considered  \n  atherogenic. This includes chylomicrons, VLDL and their remnants, IDL, LDL and Lp(a). \n  Studies have demonstrated that non-HDL-C is a better predictor of CV risk than is LDL-C.\n Atherogenic dyslipidemia:\n  This consists of an increase in TG-rich lipoproteins, low HDL-C, lipoprotein remnants  \n  (i.e. small VLDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein [IDL]) and a preponderance of  \n  numerous small and dense LDL particles and postprandial hyperlipidemia.\n  It is usually associated with insulin resistance states such as obesity, metabolic  \n  syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.\n Lp(a)\n  This has been shown to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, MI,  \n  strokes, and aortic stenosis.\n  The difficulty, to date, has been that there is no standardized assay to measure the  \n  Lp(a), the “normal levels” in the different populations is still unknown and the lack of  \n  effective therapy specifically targeting it.\nKEY MESSAGES",

Individuals  \n who are at high risk of developing CVD should have a lipid profile earlier in life (> 18  \n years of age). For individuals at high risk of developing CVD see Table 10, pg.39.\n The intensity of LDL-C lowering should be tailored to the individual’s global CV risk.\n In 2 local studies, the FRS-General CVD risk model was shown to be a better discriminator  \n of global CV risk in our local multi-ethnic population. \nKey messages #6: Management of Dyslipidemia-Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes\n Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain a critical component of CVD risk reduction. It is  \n important both prior to, and, after commencement of lipid lowering therapies in all individuals.\nKey messages #7: Management of Dyslipidemia- Lipid Modifying Drugs\n Statins are the drug of choice for reducing LDL-C in a wide range of individuals with  \n dyslipidemia in both primary and secondary prevention.\n Some individuals may require combination therapy to achieve LDL-C goals.\nKey messages #8: Primary Prevention\n Maintaining a healthy lifestyle - a healthy diet, weight control, increased exercise and  \n the avoidance or cessation of smoking - plays an important role in the prevention of CVD.\nKey Message #9: Dyslipidemia in Thyroid Disease and Cushing Syndrome\n Thyroid hormones have profound effects on lipoprotein metabolism.\n Dyslipidemia is a common metabolic abnormality in Cushing syndrome, the prevalence  \n ranging from 12% to 72%.\nKey Messages #10: Dyslipidemia in Patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n CVD has become an important cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This  \n may be due to the:\n  HIV infection itself, which may produce a cardiometabolic type of syndrome.\n  metabolic changes associated with anti-retroviral therapy (ART).\n  associated CV risk factors such as smoking and recreational drug use (e.g. cocaine).\nKey Messages #11: Dyslipidemia in Psychiatric Disorders\n Psychiatric patients have a higher risk of developing CVD. \n In addition, antipsychotic drugs also induce a dyslipidemia which increases the risk \n for developing further metabolic complications and CVD.\nKey Messages #12: Dyslipidemia in Women, Children, Adolescents and Elderly\n The goals of lipid lowering therapy is similar in both gender and in the elderly. Target  \n LDL-C levels will depend on the global CV risk (Table 4, pg. 26) \n Children whose lipid levels are significantly elevated may have a genetic dyslipidemia  \n and should be referred to specialists interested in this field.\n When prescribing lipid lowering therapy in the elderly, the presence of co-morbidities  \n and altered pharmacokinetics should be considered. Lipid lowering medication should  \n be started at a lower dose and then titrated with caution to achieve target lipid levels.",

Epidemiology \nIn 2019, pre pandemic, non -communicable diseases accounted for 7 of the 10 leading \ncauses of deaths globally.1,2 This was about 74% of all deaths and the leading cause was \ncardiovascular deaths- Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and strokes.2 \nIn Malaysia, in 2020, ischemic heart disease remained the principal cause of medically \ncertified deaths accounting for 17.0% of all deaths.3 It had been the leading cause of deaths \nfor more than 2 decades and for the first time in 2021, it was overtaken by Covid-19 \ninfections, and it dropped to second place, accounting for 13.7% of all deaths.4\nThe most recent 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) reported that among \nadults aged ≥18 years, the prevalence of some cardiovascular (CV) risk factors - diabetes \nand overweight/obesity - were on an increasing trend.5 On the other hand, the prevalence of \nhypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking, although still high, appeared to have \nstabilized and seemed to be on the downward trend.5 (Table 7, pg. 30)\nThe prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in the NHMS VI was 38.1% and was similar in both \nrural and urban populations.5-7 Even in young adults aged 30-34 years, the prevalence was \nas high as 27.9%.5 The Malaysian Health and Adolescents Longitudinal Research Team \nstudy (MyHeARTs) found that among 13-year-old students from selected urban and rural \npublic schools, almost 20-25% had total cholesterols >5.2 mmol/L.8 The CV health of these \nadolescents have documented adverse transitions over time as more of these school \nchildren appeared to be shifting towards a higher prevalence of CV risk factors.9\nData from the most recent National Cardiovascular Disease Darabase - Acute Coronary \nSyndrome (NCVD-ACS) Registry 2018-2019, indicated that Malaysians developed ACS at \na mean age of 58.7 years and almost a quarter were below the age of 50 years.10 These \nfigures are similar to that in the 10 year NCVD-ACS Registry.11 This is almost a decade less \nthan that seen in Singapore where the median age of onset of MI was 70.4 years.12 Among \npatients admitted with ACS, 61.9% had hypertension, 44.2% had diabetes and 36.7% had                  \ndyslipidemia. Risk Factor clustering was common with almost 40% having 3 or more CV risk \nfactors.10\n1.2. Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease\nIn the prevention of CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global CV risk. This guideline \nemphasizes:\n \n A multifactorial approach that addresses all CV risk factors. This is because the benefits  \n  of modifying several risk factors simultaneously are synergistic.\n That preventing CVD should be directed at global CVD burden rather than heart disease alone.\nThere already exist clinical practice guidelines addressing specific CV risk factors. The \nobjectives of this CPG on the Management of Dyslipidemia are to:\n Critically review the role of dyslipidemia as a CV risk factor.\n Provide treatment strategies for managing dyslipidemia, in the following situations:\n \n  High risk individuals - these include those who have:\n \n   Established CVD (i.e., secondary prevention)\n \n   Diabetes, multiple CV risk factors and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (i.e., primary  \n    prevention in high-risk individuals).\n \n  Individuals who are otherwise healthy (i.e., primary prevention).",

Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)\nThis is usually calculated by the Friedewald equation. This equation is not valid if the TG > \n4.5 mmol/L. In these cases, it will have to be measured directly. However, the method of \nmeasurement is not standardized and for this reason it is not routinely performed.\nThere have been reports indicating that Friedewald-calculated LDL-C values lose their \naccuracy in patients with TG ≥1.7mmol/l or LDL-C <1.8mmol/l.16,17 A large analysis, however, \ncomparing the different methods of LDL-C calculation - the Friedewald, Martin-Hopkins, NIH \nequation 2 and BQ-derived methods - found that the correlation between all methods was \ngood and the differences small and clinically insignificant.18\nFriedewald equation:\nLDL-C (mmol/L) = TC - HDL-C - TG/2.2\n(If TG> 4.5 mmol/L, this formula is not valid.)\n2.2. Non-High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (Non-HDL-C)\nNon-HDL-C (mmol/L) = TC - HDL-C\n Non-HDL-C estimates the total amount of atherogenic lipoproteins (VLDL, VLDL  \n  remnants, IDL, LDL-C and lipoprotein(a)) present in plasma. It can be used to: \n   Evaluate CV risk when the TG > 4.5 mmol/L.19\n   Predict CV risk.20 \n If non-HDL-C is used as a treatment target, the value is 0.8 mmol/L higher than \n  the corresponding LDL-C target level.\n2.3. Triglycerides\nNon-fasting TG measurements are more predictive of CV risk than fasting TG.21         \nNon-fasting TG more accurately reflects the presence of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins \ncompared to fasting TG measurements. There is however a lack of a standardized protocol \nfor quantitation of post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia. This limits its clinical applicability.21\n2.4. Fasting vs Non-fasting Lipid Measurement\nNon-fasting lipid testing is acceptable.22 The difference in values between fasting and \nnon-fasting samples is small and has been shown to have no impact on CV risk estimation \neven in diabetics.23 Concentrations of HDL-C, apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-AI), apolipoprotein B \n(Apo B), and Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) are not affected by fasting/non-fasting status.\nThe use of a non-fasting sample, simplifies blood sampling, improves compliance to testing, \nhelps workflow in laboratories and facilitates clinical decision making. \n2.

Other Lipid Parameters\n Other lipid measures that can be considered include Apo B, Apo B/ Apo A-1 ratio and  \n  Lp(a). Studies, however, indicate that measuring other lipid measures beyond the  \n  traditional lipid parameters offer little, or at the most modest, improvement in CVD risk  \n  prediction.25,26\n2.5.1. Apo B \n Apo B is found in each of the atherogenic lipoprotein particles - chylomicrons, VLDL-C,  \n  intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL), LDL-C and Lp(a). \n It is a better measure of the total atherogenic burden of the individual. \n Where appropriate laboratory facilities exist, apo B/ apo A-1 ratio should be measured  \n  given the importance of apo B/ Apo A-1 ratio as a risk factor for MI and ischemic stroke.27,28\n It is important and realistic to note that the measurement of TC (and its usual conventional  \n  derivatives) is sufficient for most regions, given healthcare cost and the limited ability of  \n  most laboratories to measure apolipoproteins.29 \n2.5.2.

There is a  \n  need for:33\n \n  standardization and harmonization of the currently available assays.\n \n  standardization of reporting units. Lp(a) measurements can be expressed in molecular  \n   mass (mg/dl), or molar concentration nmol/L, however the most appropriate units for  \n   measurement of Lp(a) are nmol/L.34 Conversion between mass and molar units is  \n   inherently inaccurate and should be avoided.\n \n  evidence-based information on the cut points for “high CV risk” based on age, sex, and  \n   ethnicity and certain comorbid conditions.\nIIa, B\nKey Message #2:\n A standard lipid profile includes measurement of Plasma or serum total cholesterol  \n (TC), LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) and Triglycerides (TG).\n TC, HDL-C and TG are measured directly from the serum and LDL-C is calculated  \n using the Friedwald’s equation provided TG<4.5 mmol/l.",

Primary Dyslipidemia\n Primary Dyslipidemia is due to genetic disorders resulting in an isolated increase in  \n  LDL-C levels or a combination of elevation of LDL-C and TG. \n It is usually due to the complex interaction of multiple genes although occasionally it may  \n  be due to single gene defects. e.g., Familial Hypercholesterolemia. \n The commonest genetic disorder is Common Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia which is  \n  caused by a combination of multiple gene defects and environmental factors such as an  \n  atherogenic diet, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity.35\n3.2. Secondary Dyslipidemia \nIn the following situations, secondary causes of dyslipidemia should be considered. For \nmanagement of these patients, refer to sections 10.3, 10.6 and 11.\n When TC exceeds 7.0 mmol/L, exclude conditions such as primary hypothyroidism,  \n  nephrosis, and cholestatic liver disease.

According to the            \nMalaysian NCVD-ACS Registry 2018-2019, the prevalence of dyslipidemia among               \nindividuals admitted with Acute Coronary Syndrome was 36.7%.10 The mean LDL-C on \nadmission was 3.1 mmol/l in males and 3.0 mmol/l in females.10\nReducing LDL-C has been shown in numerous secondary and primary prevention trials to \nreduce CVD events and mortality.42-45 \nThe evidence of the CV benefits of reducing TG and/or increasing HDL-C has been less \nrobust.\nTC, HDL-C and TG are measured directly from the serum.\n4.1. Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) \nLDL-C plays a major causal role in the development of CVD. This role has been demonstrated \nin many epidemiological and mendelian studies and in randomized controlled trials of LDL-C \nlowering.46-57 Mendelian disorders such as Familial Hypercholesterolemia, where LDL levels \nare high, lead to a high incidence of premature CVD.58 \nThe risk of CVD is also determined by the duration of exposure to high levels of LDL-C. \nStudies have shown that young adults with elevated LDL-C have significant long-term risk \nfor CVD.59,60 In Familial Hypercholesterolemia, manifestations of premature CVD become \napparent early in the third decade of life.61-65 On the other hand, there is a near absence of \nclinical CHD in populations with very low levels of serum cholesterol throughout their            \nlife- (TC < 3.9 mmol/L or LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L).66,67 The risk of CHD appears to increase \nprogressively above these levels. \nIn the secondary prevention trials, LDL-C reduction by lipid lowering therapy and lifestyle \nmodifications led to a reduction in CV events and mortality. A 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C \nresulted in a relative risk reduction of major CV events by 22% and all-cause mortality by \n10%.42 A meta regression analysis showed that the reduction of LDL-C by 1 mmol/L, by \nwhatever mechanism, resulted in a similar reduction in major CV events.44  The achieved \nabsolute LDL-C level was significantly associated with the absolute rate of major coronary \nevents.44 For each 1 mmol/L lower LDL-C level, there was a 1.5% lower event rate in the \nprimary prevention trials and a 4.6% lower event rate in the secondary prevention trials.44\nFor these reasons, LDL-C is the primary target of therapy in both secondary and primary \nprevention.42-45 Both the absolute value of LDL-C achieved and the percentage reduction in \nLDL-C lead to CV benefits.44,68-84 \nLowering TC and LDL-C lowers CV risk, the absolute benefit is greater in high-risk                 \nIndividuals.42-45 The lower the LDL-C achieved, the greater the CV benefit.72-80 At levels \n<1.8mmol/L, less progression of the atherosclerotic plaque is seen and at levels               \n<1.6mmol/L, regression of the plaque has been documented.81-84\n4.

High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C)  \nIsolated Low HDL-C is more common among Asians than non-Asians (33.1% vs 27.0%).85 \nIt is associated with a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and avoidance of alcohol intake.85 A low \nHDL-C especially when combined with high LDL-C and high TG is associated with an \nincrease in CV risk.86,87\nDespite this, increasing HDL-C levels by pharmacotherapy or by genetic techniques have \nnot shown an improvement in CV outcomes.88\n4.3. Triglycerides (TG) \nIn some people, despite achieving low LDL-C levels, the rate of CV events is still significantly \nhigh. This residual CV risk is partly contributed by cholesterol remnant particles - TG and \nTG-rich lipoproteins.89,90 \nAn increase in TG levels is due to multiple factors. These include genetic factors, systemic \nillnesses e.g., hypothyroidism, poorly control diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, a \nhigh calorie diet and certain medications.90\nRecent epidemiological and mendelian studies have shown that high TG levels may have a \ndirect causal effect on CVD and is associated with an increase in all-cause mortality among \npersons with established CVD.91,92 \nPreviously, reducing TG levels by pharmacotherapy has not demonstrated an improvement \nin CV outcomes. More recently however, the use of newer agents, specifically icosapent \nethyl (IPE) at 4 grams per day, has shown promising results.93-96 The observed CV benefits \nwith this preparation of omega 3 fatty acids, however, appeared not to be consistent with the \namount of TG lowering that occurred. \n4.4. Non-HDL-C\nNon-HDL-C reflects the concentration of cholesterol within all lipoprotein particles                 \nconsidered atherogenic. This includes chylomicrons, VLDL and their remnants, IDL, LDL \nand Lp(a). \nStudies have demonstrated that non-HDL-C is a better predictor of CV risk than is LDL-C \nand may be especially true in statin-treated patients.97-103 A 1% reduction in Non-HDL-C by \nlipid modifying drugs has been shown to be associated with a 1% reduction in CHD.104\nNon-HDL-C is the secondary target of therapy. In cases where the TG>4.5 mmol/l, \nNon-HDL-C becomes the primary target of therapy.\n4.5. Atherogenic Dyslipidemia\nAtherogenic dyslipidemia consists of an increase in TG-rich lipoproteins, low HDL-C, \nlipoprotein remnants (i.e. small VLDL and IDL) and a preponderance of numerous small and \ndense LDL particles and postprandial hyperlipidemia.\nAtherogenic dyslipidemia is usually associated with insulin resistance states such as \nobesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.\nIt has been shown to be causally linked to the development and progression of CVD.105 It \nalso contributes to the residual CV risk seen in statin treated patients.105",

(Appendix 1, pg.  \n 90-91) The cut-off points that are used in these risk models to define risk categories are  \n in part arbitrary. They are based on the risk levels at which the stipulated CV end points  \n was seen in the population studied and the levels at which benefit was demonstrated in  \n clinical trials. \n All risk models have limitations and difficulty when extrapolated to our local population.  \n Ideally, the CV risk model used should be based on data derived from our local population. \n Currently, we do not have such a CV risk score. Both Thailand and Singapore have their  \n own CV risk score which is based on the older Framingham Risk Score (10-year risk of  \n CHD deaths, Non-fatal MI only) adapted to the local populations.108,109\n The risk score that is widely used in Malaysia is the Framingham General CVD risk score  \n tool (FRS-General CVD) for primary care that assesses the 10-year risk of developing  \n CVD (heart disease, strokes, PAD and Heart Failure).110 (Tables 1 & 2 pg. 23-24) It can  \n also be calculated online at https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk-functions/\n cardiovascular-disease/10-year-risk.php\n The earlier version of the Framingham Risk Score CHD (2002) provided a risk estimate of  \n “hard” CHD events only i.e. cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction unlike the  \n FRS-General CVD Risk Score.\n The FRS - General CVD has the advantage of being derived from a population that had  \n received no or little treatment at the start and during the study.110,111 It is also simple and  \n easy to use - an important feature if healthcare providers are to use it routinely.\n In 2 local studies, the FRS-General CVD risk model was a better discriminator of CV risk  \n in our local multi-ethnic population.112,113 \n The 2013 ACC / AHA risk calculator overestimated CV risk in the Malaysian population.114\n Based on a dataset from a longitudinal Malaysian community-based study of 12, 573  \n participants aged ≥18 years, it was shown, in a recent study, that both the FRS-General  \n CVD and the Revised Pooled Cohort Equations (RPCE) showed good discrimination in  \n CVD risk prediction.115 Based on calibration however, the authors felt that RPCE would \n be  the most clinically useful model to predict CVD risk in the Malaysian population.115  \n Discrimination is the ability to accurately rank individuals from low to high risk and calibration  \n is the ability to accurately predict the absolute risk level.\n Currently, the committee still recommends the FRS-General CVD risk score for primary  \n prevention since it has been well validated.\n5.2.2. Calculation of CV Risk\n All apparently healthy individuals should be risk stratified using the FRS-General CVD  \n Risk Score110 (Tables 1 & 2 pg. 23-24) or online at: \n https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk-functions/cardiovascular-disease/10-year-risk.php\n The 10-year risk calculation is to be performed at the outset to help guide the intensity of  \n lipid lowering therapy. It cannot be used to track changes in risk over time as risk factors  \n are modified.\n Risk assessment is not a one-time event; it should be repeated, for example, every 5  \n years, although there are no empirical data to guide intervals.\nI, C",

This decreases but remains significant between 31 and 90 days (HR 4.2-4.8)  \n    and 91 to 365 days (HR, 2.0-2.1).120 The risk of a recurrent stroke and the risk of  \n    death at 1 year was 8-11%121,122 and 24.5%121 respectively.\n   Atherosclerosis in other vascular beds - aorta including atherosclerotic aortic  \n   aneurysms, carotid, cerebral and peripheral vessels.\n   Asymptomatic significant atherosclerotic plaques detected on Computed               \n   Tomography (CT) coronary angiogram and carotid ultrasound.

Dietary  \n patterns refer to the balance, variety, and combination of foods and beverages habitually  \n consumed.166\n Poor diet quality is strongly associated with an elevated risk of CVD morbidity and mortality.166 \n In general, heart-healthy dietary patterns which are associated with low CV risk, should\n be encouraged in all individuals. Energy intake and expenditure should be adjusted to  \n achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. A healthy diet consists of:166\n  Primarily fruits and vegetables.\n  Foods made with whole grains such as brown rice rather than refined rice.\n  Healthy sources of protein:\n   Mostly plant based such as tofu, beans, lentils, chickpeas, and other legumes.\n   Fish, and seafood. Eating ≥2 fish meals per week is beneficial. However, preparing  \n   fish by deep frying is not associated with CV benefits.167,168 It is healthier to pan fry,  \n   bake or boil rather than deep fry the fish.169\n   Low-fat or fat-free dairy products.\n   If meat or poultry are desired, use lean cuts and avoid processed meats such  \n   as burgers and sausages.\n  Liquid plant oils such as sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil etc. \n  Minimally processed foods - (Appendix 2, pg. 92)\n  Low added sugar and salt in beverages and foods.\n  Nuts - Consuming ½ to 1 cup of nuts per day as part of a heart healthy diet, lowers TC  \n  by 4% to 21% and LDL-C by 6% to 29%.163,170,171 This, however, contributes significant  \n  calories to the diet.163 A higher nut intake has been associated with lower risk of  \n  incidence and mortality from CVD, CHD, and strokes.166,172,173\n A plant-based diet, along with increased fruit, nut, vegetable, legumes, and lean meat or  \n animal protein (preferably fish) consumption, with the inherent soluble and insoluble fibre  \n present in the food, has consistently been associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality  \n than control or standard diets.174-177\n  Replacing animal proteins of different origins with plant proteins has been shown to be  \n  associated with a lower all cause and CV mortality rate.178 Caution is necessary with  \n  the use of some plant-based meat alternatives. These may be ultra-processed and  \n  contain added sugar, saturated fat, salt, stabilizers, and other preservatives.166   \n  (Appendix 2, pg. 92)\n The Malaysian Healthy Plate guideline recommends the #QuarterQuarterHalf diet  \n which consists of:161\n  Quarter of the plate being carbohydrates - rice, noodles, bread, cereals and other  \n  cereal products and/or tubers.\n  Quarter of the plate being protein - fish, poultry, meat and/or legumes.\n  Half of the plate being fruits and vegetables.\n  Drinking plain water.\n7.1.1.1 Dietary Cholesterol\n The role of serum cholesterol (especially LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis  \n and CVD is consistent and robust.

Dietary  \n sources only contribute about 15-20% and there is, under normal circumstances, a  \n balance between the 2 sources to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.\n Data indicates that the impact of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol levels is  \n weak.179-181 However, many high-cholesterol foods also contain high levels of saturated  \n fats (SFA). This includes dairy products, meat, and most processed foods. \n Dietary guidance, at present, tend to focus on healthy dietary patterns rather than specific  \n dietary cholesterol targets.166,182\n7.1.1.2. Total Fats - Saturated and Unsaturated Fats\n Fats in the diet consist of TG which is made up of three fatty acids and a glycerol backbone.\n Fatty acids differ in the length of their aliphatic tails, ranging from short chain (≤ 5) to very  \n long chain (≥ 22) fatty acids. Depending on the number of double bonds, fatty acids can  \n be further categorized as: \n \n Saturated fatty acids (SFA) \n \n: no double bonds \n  Unsaturated fats which may occur as either: \n   polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)  \n \n: 2 or more double bonds \n   monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)  \n: 1 double bond\n Oils are mixtures of fatty acids. For fatty acid composition of common dietary oils and  \n selected Malaysian food, refer to Appendix 3 & 4, pg. 93-95).183 \n Omega fatty acids are PUFA and include: \n \n Omega-6 fatty acids - linoleic acid found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, safflower,  \n  soybean, corn, grapeseed, peanut, and canola oils as well as nuts and seeds.184\n  Omega-3 fatty acids which consist of: \n \n \n α-linolenic acid (ALA) - found in plant oils, canola oil, flaxseed oil, soybean, chia  \n   seed, linseed and rapeseed oils, walnuts, and leafy green vegetables.185-187\n \n \n Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) - present in marine oils such as fish oils.188\n \n \n Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - present in marine oils such as fish oils.188,189  \n The rate of conversion of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids in the body is low.187  \n \nThus it is important to increase the intake of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. Sources of  \n omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) are fatty fish (e.g., salmon, ikan kembung, ikan  \n jelawat, siakap, keli, patin, senangin, white pomfret).186,188,189 For prescription omega-3-fatty \n acid supplements and its effect on lipids and CVD, refer Section 7.2.6.3.\n The body can produce all the required fatty acids except for the essential fatty acids  \n -linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.190 These must come from the diet e.g., corn,  \n sunflower, and soybean, flaxseed walnuts, and dark leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach, kailan).\n Excess intake of SFA has been implicated with an increased risk of CVD in several  \n epidemiological studies.191 Increasingly however, there has been controversy about  \n associations between total SFA and CV risk.192-200 It is also being recognized that the  \n health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content of any nutrient group without  \n considering the overall macronutrient composition.166,201\n Older guidelines recommend that the intake of SFA should not exceed 10% of energy  \n intake.140,141,161,191 (Table 5, pg. 27) The current 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans,\n however, recommends a dietary pattern low in SFA without specifying targets.166,202\n A central issue in the relationship between SFA and CVD is the specific macronutrients  \n that are used to replace it in the diet.

However, there was no significant  \n  effect on all-cause, CVD, or CV mortality.192 \n  MUFA or Carbohydrates - will not have any effect on blood lipids.192  \n Taking PUFA or MUFA (e.g.,1 teaspoon of olive oil) without cutting down SFA intake will  \n not confer CV benefit. Virgin coconut oil is rich in SFA.\n7.1.1.3. Trans Fat\n Trans fat (TFA) may be:203\n  \"Industrially produced\" TFA- these are man-made fats added to foods such as shortening \n  and baked goods. \n  \"Ruminant\" TFA- these occur naturally in small amounts in foods such as butter and beef.\n Trans fats are created through a process of partial hydrogenation.203 The presence of TFA  \n makes oils more solid and extends their shelf life. Major sources of TFA are deep-fried  \n fast foods, margarine, commercially baked cookies, cakes, crackers, and some bread.203  \n Repeated / prolonged heating of MUFA and PUFA may convert them to trans-fat.204,205\n Intake of TFA raises levels of LDL-C, reduces HDL-C, and increases the ratio of TC to  \n HDL-C.203 Prospective cohort studies showed that TFA was also associated with an  \n increase in the incidence of diabetes.206-208\n TFA appears to increase the risk of CVD more than any other macronutrient on a per-calorie \n basis.203 Even at low levels of consumption of 1-3% of total energy intake, CV risk is  \n substantially increased.203\n Total TFA fat intake was associated  with all-cause mortality, CHD mortality, and total  \n CHD.203 Industrial, but not ruminant, TFA fats were associated with CHD mortality and CHD.209\n A 2 percent increase in energy intake from trans fats was associated with a 23 percent  \n increase in the incidence of CHD.210 It was estimated that substituting 2% of energy from  \n trans fats with SFA, MUFA and PUFA would reduce CV risk by 17%, 21% and 24%  \n respectively.210\n There has been no consistent scientific evidence of a relationship between TFA with BP  \n or cancer. \n TFA intake should be kept at <1% of total energy.140,141,161 (Table 5, pg. 27)\n The TFA content in commonly available commercial food sold in Malaysian supermarkets  \n is generally very low (<1mg/100gm of weight of the food).211 \n7.1.1.4. Carbohydrates\n There are many types of diet. Some of these are:\n  Low carbohydrate diet where the proportion of calories from carbohydrates are  \n  reduced and replaced with protein and/or fats. The calories in these diets may be  \n  reduced or be maintained.\n  Low fat diet where the proportion of calories from fats are reduced and replaced with  \n  either carbohydrates and/or protein. Again, the total calorie intake may be maintained  \n  or reduced. \n  Low calorie diet where total calorie intake is reduced and the proportion of carbohy \n  drates, fats and protein may be maintained or reduced e.g., low-fat, low-calorie diet or  \n  low carbohydrate, low calorie diet.\n A low-quality carbohydrate diet has been associated with an increased risk of CVD and  \n death.212,213 This consists of:\n  Low amounts of fibre,\n  High amounts of refined grains and \nI, A\nI, B\nIIb, B",

Diets that emphasized:\nPlant-based foods and high-quality carbohydrates, such as fruits, vegetables, and\nwhole grains were associated with a lower CV event rate and cancer mortality.226\nAnimal products and low-quality carbohydrates, such as potatoes, added sugars, and\nrefined grains, were not significantly associated with lower mortality.226\nThere is no clear consensus on what defines a low-carbohydrate diet. Commonly used\ndefinitions:\nA Low-Carbohydrate diet where carbohydrates are reduced to 26-45% of total calories.\n(<225 g/day of a 2000 calorie diet).215\nVery Low-Carbohydrate diets where carbohydrate content varies from <10% to <26%\nof daily caloric intake.215,225\nA keto diet has substantially lower intakes of carbohydrate (eg, <10% of daily calories).\nThis has been shown to induce nutritional ketosis. The body uses fat as its main fuel\nsource instead of carbohydrates. This results in significant weight loss but the diet itself \nis usually non sustainable. There is inadequate data on long-term safety of keto diets.227\nFor most individuals, the risks of ketogenic diets may outweigh the benefits.227",

Lipid Modifying Drugs\n Most individuals at Low and Intermediate (Moderate) Risk can be managed by Therapeutic \n Lifestyle Changes. Occasionally, lipid modifying agents may be necessary to achieve  \n target lipid levels. Only statins have been studied in primary prevention.\n In those at Very High and High CV Risk, it is recommended that drug treatment be initiated \n early, simultaneously with TLC. There are eight  major groups of lipid modifying  \n drugs. (Tables 11, pg. 56) \n7.2.1. HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)  \n Statins are inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in hepatic cholesterol \n synthesis. This results in a reduction in intracellular cholesterol which leads to an increase  \n in LDL receptor expression at the surface of the hepatocytes. This in turn, results in an  \n increase in clearance of LDL- and other Apo B-containing lipoproteins, including TG-rich  \n particles from the plasma.\n LDL-C reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid lowering therapy to  \n reduce risk of CVD.42-45,134,135,266 They are the drugs of choice in reducing LDL-C because  \n of the consistent results of numerous randomized primary and secondary prevention  \n clinical trials.42-45,134,135,266 \nI, C\nI, A",

Lipid Lowering Effects of Statins\n The degree of LDL-C reduction seen with the different statins is dose-dependent. \n (Table 12, pg.59)269\n  A high intensity statin (i.e atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg) can, on average,  \n  reduce LDL-C by > 50%.\n  A moderate-intensity statin reduces LDL-C by about 30-50%.\n Statins reduce TG levels by 10-20% from baseline values.270 High intensity Statins have  \n moderate effect in lowering TG and in elevating HDL-C. (Table 12, pg.59)\n Statins have either no effect or result in a small increase in Lp(a) levels.271 The magnitude \n of relative risk reduction in CV events with statin therapy was, however, similar among  \n participants with high or low Lp(a).271\n Statins also have other pleiotropic effects - anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects - that \n are potentially relevant for the prevention of CVD.272-274 \n7.2.1.2. Initiating Statin Therapy\n Since cholesterol is biosynthesized in the early morning hours, statins with shorter  \n half-lives (pravastatin 1-3 hours, lovastatin 2 hours, simvastatin < 5 hours, and fluvastatin  \n < 3 hours) should be administered in the evening. In contrast, statins with longer half-lives  \n (atorvastatin 14 hours, rosuvastatin 19 hours, and pitavastatin 22 hours) can be administered \n during the day.275,276\n Treatment is initiated at the recommended starting dose with the evening meal or at  \n bedtime especially with simvastatin.275 Small short term clinical studies indicated that the  \n LDL-C fell significantly by 5-8% when simvastatin was taken in the evening rather than in  \n the morning.277-281 \n In initiating statin therapy, the following steps are proposed:\n  Evaluate the total CV risk of the individual. (Table 4, pg. 26) \n  The total CV risk will help determine the LDL-C treatment target.\n  Involve the patient in the decision-making process on managing his/her CV risk.\n  Choose a statin regimen that is likely to reach the target LDL-C level. (Table 12, pg 59)  \n  This practice will help overcome both doctor and patient inertia of starting low and then  \n  up titrating to reach the target dose.\n  Response to statin treatment is variable, therefore monitoring of the statin dose is  \n  required before additional LDL-lowering treatments are started.\n If the LDL-C treatment target is not achieved, additional treatment (s) may be necessary  \n to achieve both absolute on treatment value and percentage LDL-C reduction. This  \n includes:\n  ezetimibe and/or  \n  PCSK9 inhibitors or\n  Inclisiran",

It should not be prescribed to women of childbearing potential unless adequate  \n contraception is taken.\n7.2.1.3. Monitoring Statin Therapy \n It should be stressed that these individuals will be on lifelong therapy. It is therefore  \n important to assess them on a regular basis to monitor for:\n A)  Response to therapy and achievement of lipid targets. \n B)  Safety/Adverse effects\nA)  Response to therapy and achievement of lipid targets.\n The degree of LDL-C reduction is dose dependent and varies between the different  \n statins.282 There is considerable inter-individual variation in LDL-C reduction with the  \n same dose of drug.283 \n Inadequate response to statin treatment may be due to poor compliance and/or genetic  \n variations of cholesterol and statin metabolism in the liver.284,285\n Lipid profile should be measured at 1 to 3 months following initiation and following a  \n change in the dose of statin therapy.\n The dose is then adjusted accordingly to achieve LDL-C levels.\n If LDL-C targets have been achieved, the same dose of statin should be maintained. The  \n drug should not be stopped. \n The lipid profile can be repeated at 6-to-12-month intervals.\n If LDL-C target is not achieved, the dose of statin should be up titrated to the maximal  \n tolerated dose. If target level is still not achieved, then a non-statin drug can be added. \n The frequency of repeat testing while on stable lipid therapy, will depend on individual  \n adherence to therapy and lipid profile consistency. If adherence is a concern or the lipid  \n profile is unstable, then more frequent assessments may be necessary.286\nB)  Safety/Adverse Effects\nB.1. Liver Function\n Hepatic transaminases should be measured at baseline and at 1 to 3 months after starting  \n treatment and/or following a change in dose. \n If levels are elevated prior to therapy, other causes (e.g., fatty liver, hepatitis) should be  \n excluded. If due to fatty liver, lipid lowering therapy is not contraindicated. \n Mild elevation of ALT occurs in < 3% of patients on statin treatment, more commonly with  \n potent statins or at high doses.287 \n Mild elevation of ALT has not been shown to be associated with true hepatotoxicity or  \n changes in liver function.288-290\n When transaminase levels (especially ALT) are > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  \n on 2 occasions, the drug should be stopped. The transaminase levels tend to decrease  \n and may even normalize with reduction of the dose or cessation of the drug.\n Cautious reintroduction of therapy may be considered under close monitoring after ALT  \n values have returned to normal.\n Progression to liver failure is exceedingly rare. Routine monitoring of ALT during long  \n term statin treatment is no longer recommended.291 \n Mild elevation of transaminases at baseline is not a contraindication for statin therapy.\nIII, C",

Muscle Symptoms\n In clinical practice and in registries, 10-30% of patients report statin-associated muscle  \n symptoms (SAMS).294,295 This includes myalgia (CK normal), myositis (CK > ULN) and  \n rhabdomyolysis (CK > 10X of ULN). \n The incidence of SAMS is much lower in clinical trials, and only differs slightly from  \n placebo.296-298 In observational studies, however, the frequency varies between 10 and  \n 15%.299,300 \n In a study by Parker designed specifically to study the effects of statins on muscle  \n symptoms, the frequency of muscle-related complaints was approximately 9%.301  \n Myalgia (without CK elevation) occurs in 5-10% of patients in clinical practice.301 If the  \n symptoms are not tolerable or are progressive, the dose of statin should be reduced, or  \n the drug stopped. \n The incidence of myopathy (myositis and rhabdomyolysis) is low and is more likely to  \n occur in persons with complex medical problems (especially chronic kidney disease)  \n and/or who are taking multiple medications, or in elderly persons, especially women. \n Creatine kinase (CK) is not routinely measured unless myositis is suspected. If the level is  \n more than 5 times the ULN on 2 occasions, the drug should be discontinued. Measurement  \n should not be done after vigorous physical exertion.\n There is no uniform definition for statin intolerance. In certain trials, ‘statin intolerant’  \n patients were defined as patients unable to tolerate at least two different statins because  \n of unexplained skeletal muscle-related symptoms (pain, aches, weakness, or cramping)  \n that began or increased during statin therapy and symptoms improved when statin  \n therapy was discontinued.296\n When SAMS or statin myopathy is suspected:\n  the first step is statin discontinuation for 2-3 weeks.\n   If symptoms have not resolved, it is unlikely to be statin related and the patient  \n   should be continued on the same dose of statin. \n   If symptoms have resolved, then the following strategies may be considered:\n    Lowering the dose or decreasing the frequency to less than daily.302\n    An alternative dosing such as every other day or twice a week with atorvastatin or  \n    \nrosuvastatin303 can be used.\n    Treatment with the highest tolerable dose of statin in combination with a cholesterol  \n    \nabsorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) \n    If indicated, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered.304,305\n 92% of statin intolerant patients do well with a second statin.302 \n 73% will tolerate a re-challenge with a third statin.302\n An alternative approach is to consider co-enzyme Q10 to alleviate the symptoms of  \n myalgia. he relationship between co-enzyme Q10 and statin related muscle symptoms is  \n circumstantial. However, the risk of side effects from co-enzyme Q10 is low. Thus, a trial  \n of co-enzyme Q10 in patients with possible statin related muscle side effects may be  \n considered. The response rate is variable.306-308\n The routine use of Co- enzyme Q 10 together with statins is unproven and therefore not  \n recommended.306-308  \n Care should be taken when prescribing high doses of simvastatin (> 20mg/daily) together  \n with certain other medications that inhibit the cytochrome P450 pathway. It has the  \n potential of increasing the risk of muscle injury.309,310\n The combination of statins with gemfibrozil enhances the risk of myopathy and should be  \n avoided. There is no or very little increased risk for myopathy when combining statins with  \n other fibrates, such as fenofibrate, bezafibrate, or ciprofibrate.311,312 \nIII, C\nIIa, B",

Diabetes\n Statins have been associated with a slight increase in dysglycemia and new-onset  \n diabetes (9-12%).313,314 It occurs with all statins and is a dose related effect. The risk is  \n higher with the more potent statins at high doses.314  \n The CV reduction benefits seen with statins far outweigh the risk of developing diabetes.  \n In fact, statins have been proven to prevent CV events in persons with diabetes with no  \n overt CVD.43,69,70 \n Screening for diabetes should be considered at 6 - 12 monthly intervals in patients at high  \n risk of developing diabetes. These include the following individuals/conditions: \n  elderly \n  metabolic syndrome\n  obesity or signs of insulin resistance\n  family history of diabetes (parents and siblings)\nB.4. Kidney Effects \n An increased frequency of proteinuria has been reported for all statins, more so for  \n rosuvastatin.\n The proteinuria induced by statins is of tubular origin and is due to reduced tubular  \n reabsorption and not to glomerular dysfunction.315 \n In clinical trials the frequency of proteinuria is in general, low and in most cases is not  \n higher than for placebo.316 It is reversible on stopping the medication.\n As such, we do not recommend routine monitoring of kidney function or proteinuria.316 \n Statins do not have any deleterious impact on the kidneys and, in fact, has been shown  \n to reduce CVD and mortality in patients with CKD.

The use of goals can also aid patient - doctor communication and facilitate  \n adherence to treatment. \n If available, plasma levels of statins may be checked for compliance.\n We advocate LDL-C treatment goals and percentage LDL-C reduction.42-45,68-84 \n (Table 4, pg. 26)",

This leads to a  \n reduction in hepatic cholesterol delivery - a mechanism which complements the action of  \n statins. \n It cab be used in combination with any dose of statin to further lower LDL-C if targets are  \n not achieved with the maximum tolerated statin dose. \n Ezetimibe-statin combination therapy was found to have CV benefits in individuals with  \n CKD and following vascular surgery and acute coronary syndromes.76,83,338-341\n7.2.2.1. Lipid Lowering Effects of Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors\n Ezetimibe monotherapy can result in:342\n  Reduction of 18.58% in LDL-C\n  Reduction of 13.46% in TC\n  Increase of 3.0% in HDL-C\n  Reduction of 8.06% in TG levels.\n When used in combination with a statin there is significantly greater LDL-C reduction.  \n When ezetimibe (10 mg) was administered with any dose of a statin, LDL-C levels was  \n reduced by an additional 25%. This is far greater than the 6% obtained when the dose of  \n statin is doubled.343 This is because of dual cholesterol inhibition - liver production and  \n absorption from the gut.\n It may be considered as monotherapy in patients who cannot tolerate statins.342\n No major adverse effects have been reported with ezetimibe monotherapy.342 As add-on  \n therapy, ezetimibe resulted in little or no difference in adverse events.344\n No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild to  \n moderate kidney disease.\n It is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.345\n Recommended Dose:\n  Ezetimibe 10 mg daily\n7.2.3. Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin type 9 (PCSK9)- Inhibitors\n This group of drugs work by inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to the LDL-receptors. This  \n interaction decreases the degradation of the LDL-receptors, resulting in higher \n LDL-receptor density at the cell surface. The higher expression of LDL-receptors at the  \n cell surface leads to increased clearance with resulting decrease in LDL-C levels.346,347\n Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)have been developed against PCSK9 that have been  \n shown to reduce LDL-C, irrespective of the background lipid-lowering therapy. 77,78,84,304,305,345,348,349\n The 2 mAbs that have been approved in Malaysia are alirocumab and evolocumab.\n7.2.3.1. Lipid Lowering Effects of PCSK9- inhibitors.\n In clinical trials, alirocumab and evolocumab, either alone or in combination with statins,  \n and/or other lipid-lowering therapies, have been shown to significantly reduce LDL-C  \n levels on average by 60%, depending on the dose.350\n Both alirocumab and evolocumab have been shown to effectively lower LDL-C levels in  \n patients who are at high CV risk, including those with DM.350\nI, A",

Fibric Acid Derivatives (Fibrates)\n Fibrates are Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR)  - α agonist which have  \n an important role in fatty acid oxidation.  They reduce serum TG effectively and increase  \n HDL-C modestly. The initial lipid level has a significant impact on the size of the effect.362\n Fibrates reduce the risk of CV and coronary events in primary prevention, according to  \n moderate-quality evidence, however the absolute treatment effect is limited with absolute  \n risk reductions of about 1%.363\n Fibrates have not been shown to reduce CVD events in the secondary prevention  \n trials.364-366\n Its use is limited to the treatment of patients with very high TG levels who do not respond  \n to non-pharmacological measures to prevent pancreatitis.367 (Table 13, pg.62) \n In persons with diabetes already on maximally tolerated statins, and who have low HDL-C  \n (≤ 0.88 mmol/L) and high TG (≥2.3 mmol/L), fibrates may be considered to reduce CV  \n events.368,369 A more recent trial in this group of patients, was however neutral.370\n Dosage adjustment of fibrates is required in the presence of CKD. Serum alanine  \n aminotransferase should be monitored when starting therapy or when doses are  \n increased. (Table 13, pg. 62)\nIII, C\nIIa, C\nIIb, B",

Newer Lipid Lowering Agents\n7.2.5.1. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) PCSK-9 Inhibitors (Inclisiran)\n Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules also block the hepatic production of PCSK9.  \n Inclisiran is a long-acting, synthetic siRNA molecule that binds to a RNA-induced silencing  \n complex (RISC), thereby inhibiting the translation of PCSK9 messenger RNA (mRNA)  \n causing a marked reduction in LDL-C levels.371,372\n Inclisiran is a first in this class of therapeutic agents.\n7.2.5.1.1. Lipid lowering Effects siRNA PCSK-9 Inhibitors (Inclisiran) \n Inclisiran can reduce LDL-C by ≈50%.372-374 \n Current evidence suggests a good safety profile with total and serious adverse events  \n approximating that of placebo.373,374 \n No serious hepatic or renal effects were seen. Elevation of liver enzymes to >3x the upper  \n limit of normal was seen in about 1% of individuals.372-374 It was also found to be safe in  \n patients with mild to moderate CKD.374\n It, however, still lacks clinical evidence for the expected reduction in atherosclerotic CVD  \n events when added to statin therapy. Clinical studies are still ongoing. (ClinicalTrials.gov  \n Identifier: NCT05030428)\n Inclisiran is administered subcutaneously.\n Recommended dose:\n \n Dose of inclisiran: 284mg administered as a single SC injection, initially repeated at 3  \n  months after the 1st dose and then followed by every 6 months.\n Inclisiran should not be used in combination with PCSK-9 inhibitors since there is no  \n evidence of additive LDL lowering.345\n7.2.5.2. Bempedoic acid\n Bempedoic acid antagonizes ATP-citrate lyase, which is a rate-limiting component of the  \n cholesterol synthesis pathway.375\n It reduces LDL-C376 when given alone (by 20-24%)375,376 and in combination with a statin  \n (an additional 18% reduction)376 or ezetimibe (by as much as 38-40%).376,377 \n The combination of bempodoic acid and ezetimibe has been shown to significantly reduce \n major CV events in statin intolerant patients.378,379\nIIa, B\nIIa, B",

Other Lipid Lowering Agents\n7.2.6.1. Bile Acid Sequestrants (Anion exchange resins)\n Bile acid sequestrants bind to bile acids to promote their secretion into the intestines. This  \n leads to bile acid depletion resulting in the liver generating more hepatic cholesterol.  \n This raises the hepatic demand for cholesterol and lowers the level of LDL in the blood.\n Monotherapy has a modest effect on CHD in primary prevention trials done in the pre  \n statin era.380-382 \n There is no significant impact on HDL-C. In some individuals who are susceptible however,  \n TGs may rise.383 Its use is discouraged in patients with TG ≥ 3.4mmol/L.345\n Bile acid sequestrants provide a practical add-on option with extra LDL-C-lowering for  \n those who are unable to tolerate a guideline directed statin dose.384\n Even at low doses, these medications frequently cause gastrointestinal side effects such  \n as flatulence, constipation, and dyspepsia, which restricts their usefulness. \n Due to major drug interactions, other medications should be taken 1 hour before and / or  \n 4 hours after resins. Cholestyramine may be taken before a meal and/or at bedtime to  \n minimise the drug interactions.\n Recommended Dose:\n  Cholestyramine: 4gm/d increased by 4gm at weekly intervals to 12-24gm/day in 1-4  \n  divided doses, Max: 24gm/day\n7.2.6.2. Nicotinic Acid (Niacin) and its derivatives\n Nicotinic acid acts in the liver and decreases mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose  \n tissues. It increases HDL-C and lowers TG levels. Its effect on TC reduction is modest. \n An earlier trial showed mortality benefits with niacin during long term follow up.385 More  \n contemporary clinical studies, however, have not shown any CV benefits.160,386 \n It may be considered as an alternative therapy to fibrates in individuals with elevated TG  \n not responsive to other pharmacological options.387\n Recommended Dosages:\n  Nicotinic acid (Niacin) is available as tablets of 50mg, capsules of 100mg and 250mg.\n  Starting dose: 150-300mg daily in divided doses, titration of dose up to 2g/day (usual  \n  dose). It should be taken with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.\n7.2.6.3 . Omega-3 Fatty Acids supplements\n Omega-3 fatty acids supplements are present as:\n  Mixtures of EPA and DHA - as omega-3 ethyl esters and as carboxylic acids.\n  Purified EPA- as icosapent ethyl (IPE).\n In individuals whose LDL-C is already at target, Omega-3 Fatty Acids has a role in:\n  Reducing TG usually in combination with other lipid lowering agents.21,96 (section 11,  \n  Specific Lipid Disorders). \nIIb, B\nIIb, B\nIIa, B",

The LDL-C  \n  was reduced from 3.4mmol/L at baseline to 2.3mmol/L. This significantly reduced the  \n  primary endpoint by 25% although there was no mortality reduction seen.431 In HOPE 3  \n  the best clinical outcome was seen in patients taking both antihypertensive and lipid  \n  lowering therapy.432 In patients taking antihypertensive drugs alone, no reduction in CV  \n  events were seen. \n These observations support the analysis that the lower the absolute LDL-C achieved  \n and the greater the percentage LDL-C reduction, the greater the magnitude of the CV  \n benefits.42-44\n A meta regression analysis showed that statin therapy effectively decreased CV morbidity  \n and mortality to the same extent in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients.433\n In patient with concurrent hypertension and dyslipidemia, combination therapy has been  \n shown to not only improve medication adherence but also improvement in  CV risk  \n factor  control.434-436\n In patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia who refuse to take lipid lowering drugs, the  \n use of therapeutic lifestyle changes (non-pharmacological approaches) with a favourable  \n effect on BP and lipids, has been shown to reduce CV events.437  \nI, A\nI, A\n10.3. Diabetes Mellitus \n Patients with diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at high risk of CVD.438,439  \n These patients have higher mortality and a higher incidence of recurrent CV events.439  \n \nThis is especially in individuals with diabetes of more than 10 years duration.440-442 \n Dyslipidemia is one of the key risk factors contributing to CVD in patients with diabetes.",

Pharmacotherapy\n In patients with CKD, statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality, CV mortality \n and non-fatal CV events in primary and secondary prevention.484-486\n Lipid lowering therapy is safe in patients with CKD. However, when initiating it in patients  \n with CKD, the initiating dose of statin should be lower.338,339,487,488 These patients are at  \n high risk of medication-related adverse events especially muscle related symptoms due  \n to multiple reasons such as reduced kidney excretion, polypharmacy etc.\n The combination of simvastatin plus ezetimibe was found to be safe in CKD patients with  \n no history of MI or coronary revascularization.

Cushing Syndrome\n Chronic hypercortisolism due to Cushing syndrome is associated with the development  \n of metabolic syndrome with hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, a prothrombotic \n state, and visceral obesity. All these contribute to the increased CV risk seen in these  \n patients. Even patients with subclinical Cushing syndrome, have been found to be at  \n increased CV risk.501\n Dyslipidemia is a common metabolic abnormality in Cushing syndrome. Estimates for the  \n prevalence of dyslipidemia in active Cushing disease ranges from 12% to 72%.502 The  \n dyslipidemia in Cushing syndrome:502,503\n \n Is characterized by elevated plasma TC and TG due to increased circulating VLDL and  \n  LDL particles, and variable levels of HDL-C. \n \n The severity can be influenced by the severity and duration of hypercortisolemia,  \n  presence of diabetes, and degree of visceral obesity. \n Patients who achieve successful remission of Cushing syndrome after treatment do  \n experience improvement in dyslipidemia and other CV risk factors such as obesity,  \n hypertension, and diabetes. However, these risk factors persist after cure in a significant  \n proportion of patients.502-505 Therefore, patients may require monitoring and treatment for  \n dyslipidemia after successful biochemical remission of Cushing disease. \n10.6.2.1 Management\n In adult patients with Cushing syndrome, it is recommended to monitor lipid profile at the  \n time of diagnosis and periodically afterwards. \n In adults with persistent endogenous Cushing syndrome, irrespective of the CV risk  \n score, statin therapy, as adjunct to lifestyle modification, should be considered to reduce  \n CV risk.498 \n LDL-C should be the primary target of therapy. The target should be LDL -C < 1.8 mmol/L.498 \n Several medications used for the treatment of Cushing syndrome have important effects  \n on lipids. \n  Ketoconazole inhibits cortisol biosynthesis and is also an inhibitor of cholesterol  \n  biosynthesis, and treatment can lead to an approximately 25% reduction in apoB and  \n  LDL-C levels. \n  Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and can markedly \n  increase plasma levels of certain statins, specifically simvastatin, lovastatin, and, to a  \n  lesser extent, atorvastatin. This can significantly increase the risk of myotoxicity from  \n  statin therapy. Therefore, statins not metabolized by the CYP3A4 system (including \n  fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) should be used when cholesterol-lowering  \n  therapy is required in the setting of ketoconazole therapy. \n  Mitotane, commonly used in the treatment of Cushing syndrome, by itself can contribute \n  to a secondary dyslipidemia.498,506\nIIa, C\nKey Message #9 :\n Thyroid hormones have profound effects on lipoprotein metabolism.\n Dyslipidemia is a common metabolic abnormality in Cushing syndrome, ranging from  \n 12% to 72%.",
