During the process of development of this guideline,\nthere was active involvement of a review committee who consisted of\nhealthcare professionals both from the public and private sector.\nThis document is the first Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on The\nManagement of HIV infection in Pregnant Women in Malaysia and has been\ndeveloped in parallel with the CPG on Management of HIV Infection in\nChildren.\nLiterature search was carried out at the following electronic databases,\nInternational Health Technology Assessment Website, PUBMED, Cochrane\nDatabase of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) Journal full text via the OVID search\nengine, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registered, CINAHL via EBSCO search\nengine.  The search was limited to publications from 1985 – 2007 and for\narticles in the English language. Reference lists of all relevant articles\nretrieved were searched to identify further studies. The following free text\nterms or MeSH terms were used as the keywords: HIV infection AND\npregnancy, screening, diagnostic test, confirmatory test, rapid test, Western\nBlot, immunoabsorbent assay, immunofluorescent assay, specificity,\nsensitivity, false positive, false negative AND accuracy; management and\nHIV and pregnancy; mother to child transmission and HIV; HIV and pregnancy;\nHIV and MTCT; HIV and membrane rupture; HIV and premature rupture of\nmembrane; HIV and prom; HIV and preterm labour, ‘HIV’, ‘pregnancy’, ‘CD4’,\n‘viral load’, ‘monitoring’, ‘disease progression’, ‘vertical transmission’;\nHAART  and pregnancy; zidovudine and pregnancy; efarvirenz and pregnancy;\nnevirapine and pregnancy; HIV and postpartum care; HIV and post natal\ncare; HIV and nursing care; HIV and breastfeeding; HIV and formula feeding;\nHIV and complications; HIV/ AIDS and contraception.

In the absence of any intervention,\nbetween 30% and 45% of children born to HIV positive mothers will become\ninfected with HIV; the lower end of the range applies to higher income country\nsettings, while the upper end of the range applies to lower income, higher\nprevalence settings1\nTransmission is believed to be uncommon during early pregnancy, but the\nrisk increases sharply in late pregnancy and during labour and delivery.\nOverall, about 15-20% of children who acquire HIV infection from their\nmothers are infected during the antenatal period, 50% during delivery and\n33% through breast feeding.2\nIn June 2001, through its Declaration of Commitment, the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS undertook to\nreduce the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20% by 2005 and by\n50% by 2010, through a four-pronged strategy:\nI.\nprimary prevention of HIV infection in women of reproductive age;\nII.\nprevention of unintended pregnancy in HIV-positive women;\nIII. prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV by:\na.\nproviding antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy,\nb.\nimplementing safer delivery practices,\nc.\nproviding counselling and support on infant feeding methods\nIV. provision of care, treatment and support to HIV-infected parents,\ninfants and families.\nFrom 1986 till December 2006, there have been 76, 389 cases of HIV\nreported by Ministry of Health (MOH) with 9,155 deaths.3 Although males\naccount for more than 93% of all the HIV infections reported in Malaysia to\ndate, the proportion of new cases among females has increased sharply,\nfrom 1.4% in 2000 and 15% in 2006.\nDetermination of HIV status enables appropriate counselling, timely ARV\ntherapy and management of HIV positive pregnant women to be provided to\nreduce the risk of vertical transmission.4\nThe Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) initiated a National Prevention of\nMother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) Program in 1998. The Program\nis based partly on UNGASS “prong” 2 (i.e. detection of HIV infection during\nthe antenatal period) and more strongly on UNGASS “prong” 3 (i.e. the\nprovision of ARV therapy to mother and baby, safer modes of delivery and\nsafer infant feeding practices for HIV positive mothers (through artificial\nfeeding).\n1",

            "text": "16\nSince the introduction of the PMTCT program, a total of 2,925,472 mothers\nwere screened for HIV during antenatal period from 1998 until the end of\n2006 in government facilities. The coverage has been good and for the last\nfive years, increased from 92.8% (2002) to 99.5% (2006). However the\npercentage of HIV positive pregnant women detected was maintained at\nbelow 0.04% (graph below). The vertical transmission rate of HIV from 1998\n– 2006 was 3.8%. (* These data do not include the availability or result of\ntesting in non-government facilities nor the outcomes in HIV infected pregnant\nwomen who do not seek antenatal testing or care).\nIn Malaysia, any woman in whom HIV infection is detected during pregnancy5\nis entitled to free ARV prophylaxis or, if indicated, highly active anti-retroviral\ntherapy (HAART).The dual goals of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in pregnant\nwomen are to provide treatment for the mother and to reduce the likelihood\nof transmission of the virus to the foetus or neonate.\nIn view of increasing numbers of HIV positive women and advancements in\nmanagement, this guideline will facilitate the care of these women by\ndisseminating relevant and contemporary information to all levels of health\ncare workers in a systematic fashion.\n*In 2006, the outcome of only 62 babies out of the 170 positive pregnant women is\npresently known.\n2",

In general the risk of transmission will be highest if the\nmaternal viraemia is high and / or CD4 counts are low.6,level 6;7,Level 6;8 Level 6\nHowever, transmission has been reported in patients with low viral load of\nless than 1000 copies/ml. There is no evidence at which viral load\ntransmission occurs.9,Level 1\nBased on 13 cohort studies the risk of vertical transmission without ARV\ntreatment was estimated to be about 15 to 30% worldwide.4 Level 1 As\nmaternal health plays an important role in reducing perinatal transmission,\nthe strategy to improve HIV-related care for HIV-infected women is crucial\nto reduce HIV infection in children.\nThe most important obstetric factors that influence the transmission rate are\nduration of membrane rupture and mode of delivery. Invasive monitoring,\ninstrumental delivery and prematurity have also been shown to increase the\nrate of perinatal transmission.10, Level 9 Studies in twins suggest that the first\nborn twin is at higher risk of transmission than the second born. This supports\nthe evidence that the presence of virus in the genital tract influences vertical\ntransmission.11, Level 8\nAny invasive procedure (e.g. amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling) for\nprenatal diagnosis is not recommended unless the potential benefits outweigh\nthe risks.10,Level 9;12 ,Level 9\nRecommendation for reducing risk of transmission\n••••• Invasive procedures (e.g. amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling)\nin HIV pregnant women are not recommended (Grade C)\n3",

Elective LSCS has been shown to further reduce\ntransmission rates. 86 ,Level 1\nWomen who have a detectable viral load and / or who are not taking HAART\nshould be offered an elective caesarean section as it reduces MTCT. It is\nrecommended that delivery by elective caesarean section should take place\nafter 38 weeks of gestation. 10, Level 9\nIncreasing geometric levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA were associated with\nincreasing rates of transmission.

The estimated probability of transmission\nincreased from 8% to 31% with duration of ruptured membranes of 2 and 24\nhours respectively.93, Level 1\nTo reduce the risk of MTCT, caesarean section should be performed within\n4 hours of membrane rupture (with the exception of women stable on HAART\nwith viral load <1000 at 34-36 weeks’).  94 Level 9; 10,Level 9\nRecommendation for management of ruptured membranes\n• The duration of ruptured membranes increases the risk of\nperinatal transmission (Grade A) therefore Caesarean section is\nof doubtful benefit after 4 hours of membrane rupture.
