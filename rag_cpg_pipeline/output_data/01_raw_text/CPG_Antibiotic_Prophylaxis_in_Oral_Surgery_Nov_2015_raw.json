Sections \non periodontal surgery, cancer surgery and surgery in previously \nirradiated bone have been included. The section on trauma has been \nsimplified. There are also some changes in the choice and regime of \nthe recommended antibiotics.  In addition to the new and updated \ninformation, key messages are given where the available evidence is \ntoo weak to make a recommendation.\n  \nClinical audit indicators have been identified for the purpose of \nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes and are recommended for use in \nindividual centres.\nIn reviewing these guidelines, publications from the year 2003 onwards \nwere retrieved and scrutinized. A literature search was carried out using \nthe following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE; Cochrane \nDatabase of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); ISI Web of Knowledge and \nfull text journal articles via the OVID search engine.  In addition, the \nreference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify \nfurther studies.

From these studies several important \nprinciples were established which remain valid to this day:\ni)\t Our body’s defence against bacteria depends primarily on its \nown natural resistance. \nii)\t The risk of infection can be decreased and sometimes \nprevented by supplementing the body’s natural resistance \nwith antibiotics. \niii)\t Antibiotics must be delivered before bacterial contamination \nof the tissue occurs. \niv)\tAntibiotics serve no purpose if they are administered after the \nend of the period of active bacterial contamination.\nThere are however significant risks associated with antibiotic use. \nWhen an antibiotic is administered, strains of bacteria sensitive \nto the antibiotic are killed allowing the proliferation of resistant \nstrains. Repeated ‘selection’ of resistant strains of bacteria would \neventually render the antibiotic ineffective for prophylaxis or \ntreatment of infections associated with these bacteria. Antibiotic \nchoice is becoming increasingly limited by antimicrobial \nresistance6, level III and new antibiotic discovery is not keeping pace \nwith the rates of this antimicrobial resistance.7, level III\nAlso, an antibiotic administered to a patient can act as an \nantigenic stimulus and hence produce an allergic reaction.  \nAllergic reactions manifest either locally or systemically at \nvarying degrees of severity ranging from minor skin lesions to \nanaphylactic shock and death.\nAntibiotics in general should be used only when the benefits \noutweigh the risks to the patient and are therefore only indicated \nwhen the consequence of infection is severe or when the \nincidence of infection is high.",

The authors noted \nthat despite the lack of evidence, recommendations in Sweden \ninclude many different medical conditions for which antibiotic \nprophylaxis should be used.9, level 1\nA Cochrane Review stated that though there is some evidence \nthat prophylactic antibiotics can reduce infection and dry sockets \nfollowing third molar extraction, it was unclear whether the \nevidence in the review is generalizable to those with concomitant \nillnesses or immunodeﬁciency. They however concluded that such \npatients are more likely to beneﬁt from prophylactic antibiotics, \nbecause infections in them are likely to be more frequently \nassociated with complications and be more difﬁcult to treat.10, level 1\nThe French Health Products Safety Agency Recommendations \nstates that patients with certain medical conditions have \nan increased susceptibility to infection which would include \noncological patients, patients with congenital or immunological \nimmunodepression, patients with immunodepression due to \nmedication, patients with infectious immunodepression (AIDS), \npatients with metabolic disorders (diabetes), and patients with \nrenal and hepatic insufficiency.

In one systematic review 38, level II-3 the \nincidence of osteoradionecrosis following tooth extraction was \nslightly lower when prophylactic antibiotic was used as compared \nto when no antibiotics  was used (6% vs. 7%). The conclusions \nof this systematic review were, however, derived from weak \nevidence consisting mainly of retrospective and non-randomised \nprospective studies. Prophylactic antibiotics therefore do not \nappear to be effective in preventing osteoradionecrosis.\nThere is no difference in the incidence of osteoradionecrosis \nfollowing tooth extraction whether antibiotics are administered \nor not.\nIf osteoradionecrosis does occur, there appears to be a changing \ntrend in its management.

At the start of the study it was discovered that \ndoctors followed 3 patterns of prescribing, either i) they did not \nprescribe any antibiotics, ii) prescribed only a single dose of \nantibiotic pre-operatively or iii) prescribed 5 days of antibiotics \npost-operatively. For the doctors who prescribed antibiotics \npost-operatively, 77% prescribed one antibiotic while the rest \nprescribed two. There was also a wide range of the types of \nantibiotics prescribed which included amoxicillin, bacampicillin, \nco-amoxiclav, metronidazole, cloxacillin and cefuroxime.\nIt is important to ensure that the use of prophylactic antibiotics \nin oral surgery is evidence-based.
