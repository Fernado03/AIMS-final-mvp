Specific attempts were made to use local data and\npublications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not \nnecessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care as this \ndepends on other clinical factors like co-morbidities, acceptance of patients towards \nrecommended therapy etc.  Every health care provider is responsible to individualise \nthe management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation and \nmanagement options available locally.\n REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline is issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in 2022 or earlier if important \nnew evidence becomes available.\nCPG Secretariat\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia\nAvailable on the following websites:\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadmed.org.my\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

            "text": "2\n MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nCardiovascular Diseases (CVD) has been the leading \ncause of death in Malaysian since the early 1980s. The \nNational Burden of Disease Study in early 2000s showed \nthat coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular \ndisease (CVA) are the top two causes of death for both\nmen and women. What is of concern is that the age of \nonset of CVD in Malaysia is younger compared to\nour neighbors and some western nations. \nEqually of concern is that the incidence of the major risk factors contributing to CVD \nhas shown an increasing trend over the last 3 decades. The Ministry of Health \n(MOH) in conjunction with the Academy of Medicine and Professional Non-Govern-\nmental Organisations had since the mid-1990s had published Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (CPGs) on the Management of major risk factors for CVD. This is \nfollowed by CPGs on the Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure \nand Cerebrovascular Accidents. More recently, in 2010, the MOH launched the \nNational Strategic Plan for Non-Communicable Disease (NSP-NCD) in response to \nthe global challenge in combatting NCD in general and CVD in particular. This \ndocument is now being updated by the MOH to reflect latest developments in the \nfield and more current global targets set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). \nWhat has been missing thus far is an integrated approach to combat CVD at both \nthe primary and  secondary prevention levels. This is where this pioneering CPG on \nPrevention of CVD is a most welcome addition to compliment earlier initiatives to \nconfront the scourge of CVD. The integrated approach adopted in this CPG engag-\ning a wide spectrum of health care professionals (from dieticians to clinicians) is \nmost commendable. It is my wish that this CPG is widely available and adopted by \nall health care professionals involved in the management of CVD. I strongly believe\nthat, God Willing, compliance to the recommendation made in this CPG will go a \nlong way to improve the quality of care we offer to reverse the rising tide of this \npreventable disease. \nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector General of Health Malaysia\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

The National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS) have shown that the \nprevalence \nof \nthe \ncardiovascular \n(CV) \nrisk \nfactors \n– \nhypertension, \nhypercholesterolemia, diabetes, overweight/obesity and smoking – has been on an \nincreasing trend. The National Cardiovascular Disease – Acute Coronary Syndrome \n(NCVD-ACS) Registry has also shown that Malaysians are developing heart disease \nat a younger age than that seen in the neighbouring countries. \nThis Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease, 1ST Edition, is timely. It is directed at both individuals with and without \nestablished CVD. It has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National \nHeart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy of \nMedicine. It comprises of cardiologists, endocrinologists, general and family \nphysicians and physicians from the MOH, Public Health Division, government and \nprivate hospitals and the universities.  \nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to:\n• \nLook critically at the available evidence on the effectiveness of strategies for \n \nthe primary and secondary prevention of CVD.\n• \nEducate healthcare workers on methods of assessing and stratifying CV risk in \n \nour local population.\n• \nSuggest appropriate preventive steps against CVD at the individual, community \n \nand governmental level.\nProcess:\nA review of current medical literature on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention for the \nlast 10 years was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases – PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews.The \nsearch was conducted for the period January 2006 till 31st August 2016. Literature \nsearch was carried out using the following electronic databases – PubMed and \nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. The following MeSH terms or free text \nterms were used either singly or in combination:\n“Primary Prevention of Heart Attacks/stroke”, “Secondary Prevention of Heart \nAttacks/strokes”, “Dietary therapy for prevention of cardiovascular disease”; \nPhysical Activity for primary prevention; Physical activity for secondary prevention;\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

The relevant articles were carefully selected from \nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were \nsearched to identify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the \nfield were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines \nmainly that from the American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology \n(AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main \nreferences. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all \nstatements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The \ngrading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted \nfrom the AHA/ACC and the ESC (pg 14).\n \nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health \npersonnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector for review and \nfeedback.  \nClinical Questions Addressed:\n• \nHow common are the CV risk factors in Malaysia?\n• \nHow cost effective is CVD prevention?\n• \nWhat are the types of CVD one should target for prevention?\n \n What are the risk factors?\n \n Are there any other conditions/risk markers beyond the traditional risk \n \n \nfactors?\n• \nHow do you assess CV risk for:\n \n Primary prevention?\n \n Secondary prevention?\n• \nWhat steps should be taken to prevent CV risk at the:\n \n Individual level?\n \n Community, population and governmental level?\nTarget Group:\nThese guidelines are directed at all healthcare providers – all medical practitioners, \nallied health personnel, traditional and complementary medicine practitioners.\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n• \nIncreasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the \n \nimportance of knowing their individual CV risk.\n• \nContinuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on CV risk \n \nassessment tools and the implementation of appropriate preventative \n \nstrategies depending on each individual’s CV risk status. This can be done by \n \nroad shows, electronic media, in-house training sessions.\n• \nPerformance measures that include:\n \n Achieving of NCD Targets (Section 14, pg 133) \n \n Hospital admissions and discharges\n \n Periodic national health surveys\n \n Mortality statistics\n \n Burden of disease studies conducted every 10 years\nFacilitators, Barriers and Resource Implications\nIn the prevention of CVD, the emphasis is on lifestyle measures and the use of \nmedications  that are  already available in  the hospitals of the Ministry of Health. It \nhowever entails:\n• \nEducation of the healthcare providers on:\n \n What constitutes a healthy diet\n \n How to teach simple practical exercises that even a busy/elderly person   \n \n \ncan perform. These simple exercises should be tailored to the physical   \n \n \ncapabilities of the individual.\n \n Where to go if individuals want help to quit smoking\n \n Practical tips on losing weight and where to refer overweight/obese  \n \n \n \ninvididuals with co morbidities\nAlthough there a number of strategies to prevent /reduce the burden of \nNon-Communicable Diseases being undertaken at the governmental level, there are \nproblems of implementation. (e.g. no smoking in areas gazetted as NO Smoking \nAreas) This has to be overcome by education beginning from the young in schools \nand also via the mass media.

The data available is \nfrom the NCVD-ACS Registry. This is a voluntary registry of patients admitted with \nACS to public and private hospitals. Data from the 2011-2013 registry indicated that \nMalaysians developed ACS at a younger age than that seen in neighbouring \ncountries.6 The mean age was 58.5 years and the peak incidence was in the 51-60 \nyear age group.6 This is younger than that noted in Thailand (63.5 years)7 and \nSingapore (median: 68.3-69.2 years).8  \n1.2  \nPrevalance of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Malaysia\nThere is more representative information on the prevalence of CV risk factors locally \nfrom the National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS). \n \nThe Malaysian adult population (≥18 years) has high levels of CV risk factors. \n• \n63.6% of men, and 64.5% of women are either overweight or obese.9\n• \n43% of men smoke,9 59% of men between the ages 21-30 smoke.10 \n• \n43.5% of men, and 52.2% of women have hypercholesterolemia.9 \n• \n30.8% of men, and 29.7% of women have hypertension.9 \n• \n16.7% of men, and 18.3% of women have diabetes mellitus.9\n   \nData from NHMS V 2015 showed that the prevalence of these CV risk factors begin \nto increase from the age of 30 years.9 (Table 7, pg 28)\nThe projected adult population (≥18 years of age) in this country for 2016, stands at \n21.5 million, with 11 million men and 10.5 million women. The prevalence of CV risk \nfactors above translates into the following estimates: \n• \n13.8 million adults are either overweight or obese; 7.0 million men and 6.8  \n \nmillion women.\n• \n10.3 million adults have hypercholesterolemia; 4.8 million men and 5.5 million \n \nwomen.\n \nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

Management of Individual Risk Factors\nIn the primary prevention of CVD, the emphasis should be on the assessment and \nmanagement of the global risk of the individual and not solely concentrating on \nindividual risk factors. The global CV risk can be calculated using many different CV \nrisk calculators. The risk calculator that has been validated in our local population is \nthe Framingham General CV Risk Calculator for primary care.31 (Tables 1-3, pg \n18-20), Appendix 2, pg 166-167.\n9.1  \nHypertension \nThe NHMS 2015 showed that the prevalence of hypertension among adults 18 years \nold and above is 30.3%.9 It is now estimated that there are 6.4 million individuals with \nhypertension in Malaysia. According to NHMS 2011, almost two thirds (61%) of \nindividuals with hypertension in Malaysia were unaware they were having \nhypertension.498 Of all patients with hypertension and on treatment, only 35% of them \nachieved target BP.498 With the anticipated doubling of CVD burden especially in the \ndeveloping world in the next few decades, it is imperative that major risk factors like \nhypertension be optimally managed.\n9.1.1 \nPreventing Hypertension\n9.1.1.1 The Population Approach\nThe objective is to prevent hypertension by lowering the average BP by a relatively \nsmall amount across a whole population. In a study done in UK, it was estimated that \na reduction in SBP as low as 2 mmHg could prevent >14,000 deaths per year.499 By \nencouraging enough people to change their lifestyles sufficiently to lower their BP, \nlarge numbers are shifted to below the threshold for hypertension (140/90 mmHg).499\nThe main lifestyle changes required to achieve this are:\n• \nReducing the population average intake of salt to 5 g per day (65-75% of salt \n \nintake is from processed foods)500 (Appendix 9, pg 174 for salt content of \n \ncommon Malaysian food)    \n• \nIncreasing potassium intake by increasing fruit and vegetable intake to at least \n \nfive portions a day \n• \nControlling weight to achieve a 5-10% weight loss in overweight or obese people\n• \nIncreasing habitual PA to a total of at least 30 minutes a day of at least \n \nmoderate-intensity activity, on five or more days of the week for adults, and at \n \nleast 60 minutes each day for children\n \nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

However, it is known that the risk \nof CVD starts to increase at a much lower level of blood glucose compared to the \nonset of diabetic retinopathy (Section 9.3.1.3).521\n9.3.2.1 Epidemiology\nAccording to the NHMS 2015, the prevalence of diabetes in adults above the age \nof 18 years was 17.5%.9 In addition:9,541,533\n• \nThe prevalence in the 20-24 year age group was 5.9%. (Table 7, pg 28)\n• \nThe prevalence was highest in the Indians (22.1%) followed by Malays (14.6%) \n \nand Chinese (12.0%).\n• \nMore than half (53%) of those with diabetes were unaware of their diagnosis. \n• \nThe percentage of undiagnosed diabetes was highest among the Malays (64%) \n \nfollowed by the Chinese (52%) and the Indians (42%). \n• \nOf concern is the proportion of undiagnosed diabetes among those below the \n \nage of 30 years (88%).\n• \nOnly 23.8% of patients in primary care and 12.7% in tertiary institutions were \n \nable to achieve their A1c targets.\n9.3.2.2 Diabetes & CVD\nThe metabolic milieu of diabetes comprises mainly of but not limited to insulin \nresistance, reduced insulin secretion and/or their combination. These are \nresponsible for endothelial dysfunction, increased platelet reactivity and \ninflammation; factors that trigger and aggravate atherosclerotic vascular disease and \nthrombosis.534\nThe higher mortality and complication rates seen in diabetic patients appear to be \nmultifactorial.

Community, Population and Governmental Level\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major health burden to the country. \nPreventive care ensures a healthy population leading to a reduction in the \nexpenditure for curative care. This is the focus of the healthcare sector in the current \n11th Malaysia Plan. Health education and promotion (including media campaigns) are \nimportant in raising awareness and knowledge. However, by themselves, these are \ninadequate in achieving behavioural change. Essentially, we need “pro-health” \nnational policies to achieve positive behavioural changes.\nIn accordance with the recommendations of WHO.608 Malaysia has adopted a \n“whole-of-government” approach to effectively prevent NCDs with strong and \nproactive involvement of many ministries and stakeholders. The 3 main modifiable \nCV risk factors – unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and smoking – have to be tackled \nsimultaneously. This involves individual behavioural modification, as well as policy \nand regulatory interventions. \nMalaysians need to take on more responsibility for their own health. As such, the \nMOH puts a high priority on empowering individuals and communities to take on \nself-care responsibilities and becoming a resource for themselves and others in \ndisease prevention and management. This is done through the KOmuniti Sihat, \nPerkasa Negara (KOSPEN) Program (Section 11.4, pg 122). \nNational policies for the prevention of CVD has focused on the following main areas:\n• \nTobacco control\n• \nSalt reduction\n• \nModifying the obesogenic environment\n• \nOthers: KOSPEN\n11.1 \nTobacco Control\n11.1.1 \nLegislation for Tobacco Control in Malaysia\nTobacco control in Malaysia is regulated under the Control for Tobacco Products \nRegulations (CPTR) 2004, a component of the Food Act 1983.

This was \nintroduced in 2016 to give smokers to obtain three levels of support, namely professional advice, materials to help quit smoking \nand enlisting the smoker’s own willpower. Smokers will have the ease to get professional help from either the government \nhealth clinics or hospital, or from the private sector such as the community pharmacies.  \nThe delivery of the services is standardised through the national Clinical Practice Guidelines on Treatment of Tobacco\nDependence615. On top of that, a national Quitline was established to help and guide smokers to quit through behavioural \nintervention through telephone calls. \n2. \nSchool programs to develop a Smokefree Malaysian Generation \nPreventative programme: Implementation of the IMFree Program616 This is an educational program for smoking prevention \namong primary school children age 7 to 12 years. Some components of the IMFree Program are also implemented in pre-\nschools under the Tunas Doktor Muda Program throughout the country. \nIntervention programme: The majority of smokers had their first cigarette before the age of 14 years old. Therefore, intervention \nprogrammes for school children are deemed essential.  \n• \nThe Kesihatan Oral Tanpa Asap Rokok (KOTAK) is a new initiative but as an extension to the existing \nIncremental School Dental Care programme. In this programme school children who are detected as smokers will \nbe given interventions to help them beat smoking. \n• \nA new Guidance for Helping School Children Who Smoke was developed to give guidance to school counsellors on \nhow to manage school children who smoke. This approach is a curative approach rather than punitive. Smokers will \nbe coached on how to quit smoking properly. \n3. \nEmpowering the community \nTo empower the communities to stop smoking and creating smoke-free environments through the KOSPEN Program. \nKOSPEN is currently a flagship program led by the MOH for community-based NCD risk factor screening and intervention. \n(more information on KOSPEN in Section 11.4) \nSpecifically, for smoking, smokers identified through the screening are referred for quit smoking services available in their area. \nThe KOSPEN volunteers could have a great influence in encouraging their fellow community members to quit smoking properly\nthrough professional smoking cessation in their local area. \n4. \nProtecting the public from the dangers of tobacco smoke \n• \nThrough volunteerism: To reduce exposure to second-hand smoke, houses in the KOSPEN area are encouraged \nto commit to “My Smokefree Home” declaration and all community events declared “Smoke-free”. On the other \nhand, the Blue Ribbon5 programme is a voluntarily smoke free declaration in public places such as businesses, \neateries and other community places. \n• \nGazettement of Smoke-Free Places by law: Smoking is generally prohibited on public transportation. Smoking is \nprohibited in specified public places and workplaces listed in the regulations including, among others, in workplaces\nwith a centralized air-conditioning system; health, education, government and cultural facilities; and indoor stadiums. \nSmoking is also prohibited on floors with a service counter in banks, financial institutions, national telecom \ncompany, national energy company and post offices. Expansion of places to be gazetted as smoke-free place is \nbeing undertaken; most recently the rest & respite areas of the federal highways – and will include all hotels, public \nparks and all restaurants. \n5. \nOther Tobacco Control Activities \n• \nTobacco Packaging and Labeling: Rotating combined picture and text health warnings are required to occupy \n50% of the front and 60% of the back of the package. The text of the warning is in Malay on the front panel and \nEnglish on the back panel. Misleading packaging and labeling, including terms such as “light” and “low tar” and\nother signs, is prohibited. Efforts are currently being undertaken to move towards “plain packaging”. \n• \nIncrease in tobacco excise tax: Fiscal measure is one of the best option for reducing demand for cigarettes. It is \nalso a great deterrent for non-smoker to take up smoking. WHO FCTC encourages countries to raise their tobacco \ntaxes to at least 75% of the retail price. \n \nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

It is known as \nKomuniti Sihat Perkasa Negara (KOSPEN). The program aims at bringing the NCD \nrisk factor related activities to the community by creating trained health volunteers, \nwho will function as “agents of change” or health enablers who will introduce and \nfacilitate healthy living practices amongst their respective community.\nThe main objectives of KOSPEN are to:\n• \nEmpower the community in adopting and practicing healthy lifestyles and \n• \nEnhance their participation and involvement in programs aiming at preventing \n \nand controlling NCD in Malaysia. \nThis program was launched in 2014. Its main scope is promoting a healthy diet, \nactive living, non-smoking, weight management and routine community NCD risk \nfactor screening.\nThe MOH is currently collaborating with the Ministry of Rural and Regional \nDevelopment (through the Department of Community Development or KEMAS) in \nimplementing KOSPEN in rural areas, and collaborating with the Department of \nNational Unity and Integration (through Rukun Tetangga) for urban and sub-urban \nareas. \nA group of health volunteers within the identified residences or community registered \nunder both collaborating agencies are provided with training that will enable them to \npromote healthy behaviours, advocate for healthy policy adoption and facilitate \nenvironmental changes within the local community. These trained volunteers are \nalso capable of conducting basic health screening consisting of measuring blood \npressure, blood glucose levels and BMI. They also conduct semi-structured \ninterventions, and those at high risk would be referred to nearby health clinics for \nfurther investigation and management.\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

Traditional and Complimentary Medicine\n12.1 \nDefinition of Terms and Concepts\nTraditional medicine, by WHO definition,617 is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, \nand practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different \ncultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in \nthe prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. \nIn Malaysia, it identifies strongly with the respective ethnic cultures and is often \nconsidered as an important part of their cultural heritage. \nComplementary medicine refers to a broad set of healthcare practices that are not \npart of that country’s own traditional or conventional medicine and are not fully \nintegrated into the dominant healthcare system.618 It is often used together with \nconventional medicine. \nAlternative medicine, on the other hand, is used in place of conventional medicine.\nIn Malaysia, the Traditional and Complementary Medicine ACT 775, (2016)619 \ndefines the practice of T&CM as a form of health-related practice designated to \nprevent, treat or manage ailment or illness or preserve the mental and physical \nwell-being of an individual. The handbook on T&CM outlines the program in \nMalaysia.618 \nAccording to the Act 775, T&CM practices includes:\n• \nTraditional Malay medicine  \n• \nTraditional Chinese medicine\n• \nTraditional Indian medicine\n• \nIslamic medical practice\n• \nHomeopathy and \n• \nComplementary therapies\nIt excludes medical and dental practices used by medical and dental practitioners \nrespectively. (Appendix 12, pg 177-178)\nTCM stands for Traditional Chinese Medicine whereas T&CM is abbreviation for \nTraditional and Complementary Medicine.

The \n \npractitioner uses his/her thumbs, palms, elbows and/or feet in applying a sustained mechanical \n \npressure during massage. Sometime massage tool such as wooden stick, comb, and horn may \n \nbe used as an aid during the massage. Traditional Malay massage may involve recitation of\n \nprayers.\n    • Malay Herbs- Herbs are used as a complement therapy in TMM in the treatment of a disease or \n \nenhancement of wellness. It may consist of any part of a plant such as root, leaf or stem, either \n \ndry or fresh.\n    • Cupping- This is a form of traditional medicine found in many cultures world-wide. TMM \n \npractitioners do not combine other forms of practices (such as herbal prescription) during or \n \nafter cupping\n    • Postnatal care- There are three unique features in Malay postnatal care: the use of herbs, the \n \nuse of heat and Malay postnatal massage. Malays are the main users.\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM)\n    • Is based on knowledge inherited from generation to generation among the Chinese community \n \ngrounded on a profound philosophy of Yin Yang and Five Element. \nTCM uses many forms of treatment methods, the major methods being:\n    • Chinese herbs and material medica that involve mineral substance and animal components \n \nmay be combined to form concoction. This is the most important method used to treat various \n \ndiseases and manage the health of individual.\n    • Acupuncture, acupressure, Tuina, moxibustion, cupping and Guasa- These are the physical or \n \nmechanical treatment methods often use together under the guidance of the Meridian Theory, \n \nYin Yang and Five Element Theory. \n \n \nAcupuncture needles are suitable for deep but small area stimulation of human body. \n \n \nCupping and Guasa are suitable for large but superficial stimulation of skin area. \n \n \nAcupressure is method of the choice when relatively mild stimulation is indicated or when \n \n \nthere is no suitable equipment available. \n \n \nMoxibustion provides stimulation of acupuncture points and heat therapy simultaneously. \n \n \nTuina is a form of manipulative treatment method use for treatment of certain disease \n \n \nand health condition. The practitioner can use a range of motion, traction, and massage \n \n \nwith the stimulation of acupuncture points.\n    • Qigong- This is a practice of aligning body, breath and mind to cultivate and balance qi or what \n \nhas been translated as “life energy”.\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease 2017",

            "text": "APPENDIX 12: FORMS OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE (cont’d)\nTraditional Indian medicine (TIM)\nHas 5 major forms:\n    • Ayurveda means “science of life”. The principal objectives of Ayurveda are maintenance and \n \npromotion of health, prevention of disease and cure of sickness. It is a famous practice in North \n \nIndia. It is a system based on 5 elements-space, air, fire, water and earth; and treatment concept \n \nbased on balance of the three elemental substances. These elemental substances combine in \n \nthe human body to form three life forces or energies, the Doshas. The Doshas consist of Vata \n \n(kinetic energy), Pitta (thermal energy), Kapha (potential energy) that governs physiological and \n \npsychological functions of the body. An equal balance of the 3 doshas leads to health, while \n \nimbalance in them leads to disease. Ayurveda emphasizes on Dietary Principles (Ahara Niyma), \n \nDaily regimen (Ritucharya), Good conduct/social behaviour (Sadavritta), the use of plant based \n \nmedicines and treatments. \n    • Siddha came from the word siddhi, which means perfection of heavenly bliss. Siddha system \n \ngained popularity in South India especially in Tamil Nadu. Siddha medicine is a form of the TIM \n \nthat uses a therapeutic concept. It is assumed that when the normal equilibrium of the three \n \nhumors (Vaadham, Pittham and Kabam) is disturbed, disease is caused. The factors, assumed \n \nto affect this equilibrium, are environment, climatic condition, diet, physical activities, and stress. \n \nAccording to the siddha medical system, diet and life style play a major role, not only in health \n \nbut also in curing disease.\n    • Unani is a form of TIM practiced mostly by Indian Muslim. According to its teachings, the body \n \nis comprised of four basic elements (earth, air, water and fire) and four humors (blood, phlegm, \n \nyellow bile, and black bile). Equilibrium in the humor indicates good health while a disturbance \n \nin this equilibrium results in disease. \n    • Yoga is a practice that involves physical movement, mental focus and spiritual strength. It \n \noriginates from ancient India. The aim is to achieve a peaceful state of mind. Yoga also has been \n \npopularly defined as “union with the divine” in the context of other traditions. It has eight folds or \n \npaths that advocate certain restraints and observances, physical discipline, breath regulations, \n \ncontemplation, meditation and Samadhi. \n    • Naturopathy- Practitioners often recommend the use of natural materials, such as sunlight, \n \nherbs and certain foods, as well as the activities that are supposed to be natural, such as \n \nexercise, meditation and relaxation. They claim that natural treatment helps restore the body’s \n \nnatural ability to heal itself without the adverse effects of conventional drugs. This treatment is \n \noffered through consultations. \nHomeopathy\nThis is a system based on Samuel Hahneman’s doctrine of “like cures like”, according to which a \nsubstance that causes the symptoms of disease in healthy people will cure similar symptoms in sick \npeople.
