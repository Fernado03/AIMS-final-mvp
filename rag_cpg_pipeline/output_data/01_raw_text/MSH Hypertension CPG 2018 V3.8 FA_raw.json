            "text": "STATEMENT OF INTENT\nThis guideline was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the management \nof hypertension. All efforts were made to ensure references quoted were the most \ncurrent at the time of printing. Specific attempts were made to use local data and \npublications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline may not necessarily \nlead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care. Every health care provider \nis responsible for the care of his/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation \nand treatment options available locally. However, adherence to this guideline is strongly \nrecommended as a starting point in managing patients as it constitute the best available \nevidence at the time of writing.\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThis guideline was issued in 2018 and will be reviewed in 2023 or earlier if important \nnew evidence becomes available. This is an update to the Clinical Practice Guideline \non Management of Hypertension – 4th Edition (published 2013) and supersedes the \nprevious. Electronic version will be made available on the following websites:\nwww.moh.gov.my \nwww.acadmed.org.my \nwww.msh.org.my\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nThe panel members had completed disclosure forms. None held shares in pharmaceutical \nfirms or acted as consultants to such firms. Some may have been engaged as speakers in \nconferences or Continuing Professional Development activities mainly organised by the \nMalaysian Medical Association, the Malaysian Society of Hypertension, National Heart \nAssociation of Malaysia or similar professional non-governmental associations (NGOs). \nThese events may or may not have received financial assistance from pharmaceutical \ncompanies as part of an educational grants (details are available upon request from the \nCPG Secretariat).\nSOURCE OF FUNDING\nThe development of the CPG on Management of Hypertension (5th Edition) was \nsupported via unconditional educational grant from Servier Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. The \nfunding body was not involved in and has no influence on the development of the \nguidelines. An independent third party was engaged for all secretarial task and was \nappointed by and reported directly to the Malaysian Society of Hypertension.\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)",

This \nhas not changed since 2011. Blood pressure should be measured at every \nchance encounter. \n4.\t Untreated or sub-optimally controlled hypertension leads to increased \ncardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal morbidity/ mortality and overall \nmortality.\n5.\t A systolic BP of 120 to 139 mmHg and/or diastolic BP of 85 to 89 mmHg \nis defined as ‘at risk blood pressure’ and should be treated in certain high \nrisk groups. \n6.\t Healthy living should be recommended for all individuals with hypertension \nand ‘at risk blood pressure’. \n7.\t Decisions on pharmacological treatment should be based on global \nvascular risks and not on the level of blood pressure per se. \n8.\t In patients with newly diagnosed uncomplicated hypertension and no \ncompelling indications, choice of first line monotherapy includes ACEIs, \nARBs, CCBs, diuretics and ß-blockers.\n9.\t Only 37.4% of Malaysian patients achieved blood pressure control (<140/90 \nmmHg) while on treatment. Although this is an improvement from 2011 \n(34.7%) every effort should be made to achieve target blood pressure in \nall patients. Target blood pressure depends on specific patient groups. \n10.\tCombination therapy is often required to achieve target and may be \ninstituted early in patients with stage II hypertension and in high risk \nstage I hypertension.\n11.\tA patients whose BP is not controlled on three or more drugs (including a \ndiuretic) is by definition having resistant hypertension. \nKey Messages\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)\n3",

            "text": "In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nIn 2015 the Ministry of Health released data from the National Health and Mortality \nSurvey which focused on Non Communicable Diseases. Diseases of the heart and \ncirculatory system (Cardiovascular diseases or CVD) still dominates the national health \nlandscape being the number 1 cause of morbidity and mortality for the last few decades \nand is projected to do so for years to come. Of all the risk factors contributing to CVD, \nhypertension confer the greatest risk for both male and female based on the latest \nnational burden of disease in 2008. It is thus pertinent that all health care providers \ndirectly or indirectly involved with CVD know what is latest in the management of \nhypertension. \nI will like to record my utmost appreciation to all the members of the Working Group \non Hypertension for their tireless effort in coming up with this latest edition of the \nHypertension Clinical Practice Guideline. This is the fifth in the series since it was \nfirst launched in 1998. This reflects the rapid evolution of knowledge in hypertension \ndriven by major outcome trials for which there were a few since the last edition 5 \nyears ago. There are also more Malaysian studies quoted which is a testimony of the \ngrowing research interest in the topic nationally. I am happy to report that in some \nof the landmark multicentre clinical trials quoted, Malaysian researchers were actively \ninvolved. A special thanks to the Health Technology Assessment Unit of the Ministry of \nHealth Malaysia for ensuring that the development of this CPG conforms to the high \nstandards it had laid down. \nAlthough the NHMS 2015 showed some positive developments in important key \nindicators on hypertension, there is still a lot of scope for improvement. It is hoped \nthat this latest edition of the Hypertension CPG will continue to play an important role \nin controlling this major CVD risk factor. It is the hope of the Working Group that the \nrelease of this new edition will be followed by concerted effort by various stakeholders \nto implement the recommendations made. By so doing, we will have contributed in \na significant way to combat the scourge of CVD particularly pre mature CVD. If that \nhappens, this CPG will have served its purpose, God Willing.\nYours Sincerely,\nAbdul Rashid Abdul Rahman\nChairman, Working Group on Hypertension CPG 2018\nForeword\nForeword\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)\n7",

            "text": "RATIONALE\nThe Clinical Practice Guideline on the Management of Hypertension was developed \nto provide a clear and concise approach to all health care providers on the current \nconcepts in the management of hypertension. Since hypertension is managed by various \nlevels of health care providers in Malaysia, attempts were made to ensure the different \nstakeholders will benefit from this CPG. This is reflected by the representation of the \ncommittee members who developed the guideline. There were four previous guidelines \non hypertension; in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2013.This edition is the fifth in the series and \nwas deemed necessary due to new evidence which has emerged since the last edition. \nPrior to the publication of this edition, the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015 \nwas published. The results of the survey showed that the prevalence of hypertension has \nincreased while the awareness has decreased compared to a similar survey done in 2011. \nHowever the rate of blood pressure control in the hypertensive population has increased \nby 10% (now 37.4% of treated patients are controlled). This rate of blood pressure control \nis still poor when one compares with a large nation like Canada where the control rate \nwas more than 80%. This may reflect the fact that clinicians are still not clear of the target \nblood pressure to achieve in their patients. It is hoped that this CPG will contribute \ntowards achieving the desired targets.\nGUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) \nwere from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and \nprivate healthcare providers. The membership of the DG was multidisciplinary and most \nspecialties are represented by at least 2 experts. These are Cardiovascular Medicine, \nNephrology, Geriatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Family Medicine and Clinical \nPharmacology/Clinical Pharmacy. There are also specialties which are represented by 1 \nexpert. These include Endocrinology, Neurology and Public Health. Where there are at \nleast 2 members, 1 act as the principal author and the other reviewer of the initial draft. \nEach draft will then be reviewed collectively in every DG meeting.\nThe CPG update was done based on the CPG Management of Hypertension 4th \nedition of 2013. In the update, systematic review methodology was used and the scope \ncovered include epidemiology and public health, definition and classification, blood \npressure management, diagnostic criteria, investigations, global cardiovascular risk \nevaluation, general principle of management, non pharmacological and pharmacological \nmanagement, management of patient sub groups and approach to resistant and \nrefractory hypertension. Emerging areas in hypertension are also covered including \nHealth Economics, Device Based treatment and scope for future research.

The search was done on Published English literature focusing \nmainly but not exclusively on Clinical Trials. Important observation studies, where relevant, \nwere also looked at. Unlike some CPGs, the search was not limited to literature published \nin the last fifteen years. This is because hypertension management has be powered and \ndriven by good evidence generated over the last thirty years. Some seminal and practice \nchanging trials were conducted a few decades ago and the result so conclusive that \nrepeating the trials will be an act of futility. In addition, the reference lists of all recent \nHypertension Guidelines i.e that written over the last 5 years only were retrieved and \nsearched to further identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 24 May \n2017 to 5 January 2018. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at \nthe end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published after \nJanuary 2018 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. \nReferences were also made to the most recent CPG on Hypertension from the American \nCollege of Cardiology / American Heart Association released in full in December 2017. \nThis CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation \n(AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.\nA total of 23 clinical questions were developed under 13 different sections. Members of \nthe DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer to Appendix 5 for \nClinical Questions). The DG members met 9 times throughout the development of these \nGuideline. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and further \ndiscussed in each DG meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated after \nthat were agreed upon. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were \nmade by consensus of the DG. This CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic \nreviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials in particular trials where Malaysia participated. \nWhere evidence are lacking or non existent, local practices are taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive \nServices Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of recommendation was \ndone using the principles of Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (Version 1.0 \nupdated July 2017). The writing of the CPG follows strictly the requirement of AGREE II. \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external reviewers both nationally \nand internationally. It was also posted on the Malaysian Society of Hypertension (MSH) \nofficial website for feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to \nthe Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia \nfor review and approval. Details on the CPG development methodology by MaHTAS \ncan be obtained from Manual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based \nClinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh.gov.my/\nindex.php/pages/view/117).\nRationale and Process of Guidelines Development\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)\n11",

Epidemiology, Definition and Classification of Hypertension\nFIGURE 1-B DALYs Attributable to Risk Factors, Malaysia 20082\nThe latest National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) for NCD risk factors in 20153 \nshowed an overall prevalence of hypertension of 35.3% among adults 18 years and \nabove. This is an increase from 33.6% in 2011 as compared to 34.6% in 2006. However, \nin terms of awareness, only 37.5% were aware in 2015 a drop from 40.7% in 2011. In \n2006, the awareness rate was 35.6%.3\nNo significant difference between gender was observed. There was a general increasing \ntrend in prevalence with age, from 6.7% in the 18-19 years age group, reaching a peak \nof 75.4% among the 70-74 years age group. Based on the 2015 survey, prevalence was \nthe highest among other Bumiputras (37.3%) followed by Malays (36.4%), Indian (34.9%) \nand Chinese (34.2%).3\nHypertension was more prevalent in the rural area in all three NHMS: 36.9% versus \n32.9% (2006), 36.5% versus 32.6% (2011) and 39.2% versus 34.1% (2015). In terms of \ngender differences, hypertension was more prevalent among males; 35.3% versus \n33.9% (2006), 34.2% versus 33% (2011) and 35.9% versus 34.8% (2015).\nThe relationship between BP and risk of cardiovascular events is continuous, consistent \nand independent of other risk factors. The higher the BP, the greater the chance of \nmyocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and kidney diseases. The presence of each \nadditional risk factor, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus or smoking status, \ncompounds the risk. Therefore, the main aim of identifying and treating high BP is to \nreduce these risks of end organ damage or end organ complications.

The \nprevalence of systolic hypertension increases with age, and above 50 years of age, \nsystolic hypertension represents the most common form of hypertension. DBP is a \nmore potent cardiovascular risk factor than SBP until age 50; thereafter, SBP is more \nimportant.10 \n1.2 Isolated Office (“White-Coat”) Hypertension\nIsolated office hypertension is characterised by an elevation in clinic blood pressure \nbut normal home or ambulatory blood-pressure values. In these subjects the clinic \nBP is persistently above 140/90 mmHg but the home or daytime ambulatory systolic/ \ndiastolic BP measurements are lower than 135/85 mmHg.\n1.3 Masked Hypertension\nPatients with masked hypertension have normal clinic blood pressure but elevated \ndaytime ambulatory or home blood-pressure level (≥135/85 mmHg). Prognosis of \nmasked hypertension is worse than isolated office hypertension.12\nFor both isolated office and masked hypertension, once diagnosed, initial therapeutic \ninterventions should be non-pharmacological and aim for adoption of healthy living. \nHowever, drug treatment is indicated, particularly when the patient’s cardiovascular risk \nprofile is elevated or when target-organ damage (TOD) is detected.12 (Refer to chapter \n3 on Diagnosis and Initial Assessment).\nSUMMARY\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)\n29",

The former may however give rise to dose-related \nadverse effects. Properly selected antihypertensive combinations may also mitigate \nthe adverse effects of each other. If the patient does not show response or does not \ntolerate the initial drug, substituting with a drug from another class is recommended.\n(Level III) In patients presenting with stage II hypertension or beyond, combination \ntherapy as first line is recommended.(Level III) (Refer to Figure 5-A). Combination \ntherapy can be considered as first line in high risk stage 1 hypertension especially \nfor secondary prevention 83,84 (Level 1)\nSingle Pill Combinations (SPC) is very convenient to use and promote treatment \nadherence by reducing pill burden and simplifying the treatment regimen.104,105,106 \n(Level 1) In addition, it takes less time to achieve BP control using a combination than \nmonotherapy.107,108,109 (Level I)\nIt should be emphasized that simplification of the treatment regimen using SPC is \nonly one strategy for improving adherence. For many patients, cost is a critical issue. \nIn Malaysia, generic SPC are generally not available. Patented SPC are available but \nare more expensive. This may adversely affect adherence especially for self-paying \npatients. Free drug combination is the obvious choice in such circumstances. It is \nhowever worth emphasizing that available evidence showed SPC is associated with \nnot only improved adherence, but also lower overall healthcare cost.110(LevelII-2)\nIt is important to be reminded that the beneficial effects of BP lowering with \npharmacotherapy is demonstrated from medium to very high CV risk.

For patients <80 years old, the target \nSBP should be <140 mmHg and DBP <90 mmHg.88,100 For patients aged 80 years and \nabove, aim for a target of <150/90 mmHg115 (Refer to chapter 7.5 on Hypertension \nin Older Adults). For high/very high risk individuals the target is <130/80 mmHg116,117 \n(Refer to chapter 7 on Hypertension in Special Groups).\nIf BP is still >140/90 mmHg with three drugs, including a diuretic at optimal tolerated \ndoses, there is a need to exclude medication non-adherence and isolated office \nhypertension. After excluding these causes of uncontrolled hypertension, the patient \nis then defined as having resistant hypertension118 (Refer to chapter 10 on Resistant \nHypertension). A quick check on the possible causes of resistant hypertension is \nrequired. These include:\n•\t secondary hypertension\n•\t excessive sodium intake, excessive liquorice intake, drugs and drug \ninteractions. (see chapter 4 Non-pharmacological Management) \n•\t complications of long standing hypertension such as nephrosclerosis, loss of \naortic distensibility and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis\n5.2 Follow–Up Visits\nFollow up intervals should be individualised based on global CV risk, pre-treatment BP \nlevels and drugs used. For high and very high risk patients, it is advisable to bring the \nBP to target within 3 to 6 months.82 Once target BP is achieved, follow-up at three to \nsix-month intervals is appropriate. As a rule, once the BP is controlled, most patients \nwill require life-long treatment. Patients must be counseled to have at least six monthly \nfollow ups even though the BP is well controlled and not to resort to merely going for \nrepeat prescription without seeing a doctor. During these visits, doctors should assess \npersistence of BP control, adverse reaction to treatment, global vascular risk (including \nnew onset and pre-existing CV risk factors) and complications of hypertension with may \nhave developed since the last visit.\n5.3 When To Refer\nMost patients can be effectively managed by primary care practitioners. Patients with \nthe following conditions should be referred to the appropriate specialists including \nFamily Medicine Specialists for further assessment. Indications for referral to the \nappropriate specialists include:\n•\t severe hypertension (>180/110 mmHg) - refer to chapter 6 on Management of \nSevere Hypertension\n•\t suspected secondary hypertension\n•\t resistant and refractory hypertension\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)\n45",

Its presence increases the \nrisk of morbidity and mortality. In 2016 the prevalence of hypertension in Malaysian \ndiabetics was 76%.138 Hypertension should be treated early in diabetes to prevent both \nmicrovascular and macrovascular complications and CV death.\n7.1.1 Threshold for Treatment\nPharmacological treatment should be initiated in patients with diabetes when the BP \nis persistently ≥140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic.\nThe presence of microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria should be treated even if the BP \nis <140/90 mmHg.

Normalisation of microalbuminuria is \nassociated with a reduction in the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate.148\n7.1.2 Target Blood Pressure\nTight BP control should take precedence over the class of anti-hypertensive drug \nused.149,150 (Level I) This will often require combination therapy. \nPrior to the ACCORD study, it was generally accepted that for diabetics, the lower \nthe BP the better the outcomes. However, in the ACCORD Study, diabetic patients \nat high risk of cardiovascular events who were randomised to a target systolic blood \npressure (SBP) of <120 mmHg, did not show a reduction in the composite outcome of \nCV death, myocardial infarct and stroke, as compared with <140 mmHg.151 (Level I) This \ncould possibly be due to the J-curve phenomenon seen in this particular cohort of \npatients who had underlying cardiovascular disease at baseline.

Hypertension in Special Groups\n7.2.1 Hypertension and Non-Diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease \nHypertension may be a cause or consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).164,165 \nCKD is one of the commonest causes of secondary hypertension. Hypertension \nin CKD is often associated with an elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria and/or \nhaematuria. The prevalence of hypertension increases with increasing levels of renal \nimpairment, and approximately 50-75% of individuals with GFR <60 ml/ min/1.73m2 \n(CKD stages 3–5) have hypertension.166 Hypertension accelerates the progression of \nCKD and may lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, CKD is associated \nwith an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There are proven benefits of \nblood pressure lowering for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with \nmoderately reduced kidney function167 as well as those on dialysis.168,169(Level 1)\nTight control of BP in patients with CKD is therefore important. BP goals depend on \nurinary protein excretion. The target BP should be <140/90 mmHg for patients with \nCKD170-172 (Level I) and <130/80 mmHg for those with proteinuria ≥1g/24hours.173(Level I) \nWhere well tolerated, aiming towards an Automated Office Systolic BP of 120mmHg \nin patients aged >50 years with nondiabetic nephropathy, GFR>20 ml/min/1.73m2 \nand proteinuria <1g/day has shown cardiovascular benefits.174,175(Level II-2) When \naiming towards <120 mmHg systolic, close monitoring is recommended to detect \ntreatment-related adverse effects including hypotension, syncope, electrolyte \nabnormalities and acute kidney injury.175 All anti-hypertensive drug classes can be \nused to achieve this goal.167 \nIn the management of hypertension in CKD, control of BP and proteinuria are the \nmost important factors in terms of retarding CKD progression. Anti-hypertensive \nagents that reduce proteinuria have an advantage in patients with nondiabetic \nproteinuric nephropathy. Meta analyses of comparative trials concluded that \nACEI conferred an anti-proteinuric effect greater than other anti-hypertensive \ndrugs.176(Level 1) Overall 30% reduction in incidence of ESRD with ACEI can be \nexpected.177 The anti-proteinuric effect and reduction in ESRD was beyond that \nattributable to the BP lowering effect.172,178(Level I) This anti-proteinuric effect of ACEI \nwas most prominent in patients on a low sodium diet or those treated with diuretics. \nPatients with proteinuria >3g/24 hours benefit the most.172,178 The advantage of ACEI \nis most apparent in patients with rapid progression of renal disease associated with \nproteinuria. ARBs are similar to ACEI in lowering BP and reducing proteinuria.\nCombined RAS blockade can reduce proteinuria more than monotherapy.179 \nHowever this is associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, hypotension and \nrenal failure.180(Level 1) Hence, this approach is not recommended in patients with CKD.\nRenal insufficiency should not be a contraindication to starting ACEI or ARB therapy, \nnor should it be a reason for discontinuing therapy.

This is especially important in the presence \nof other risk factors. Multiple CHD risk factors combine as multipliers, to increase \nCHD risk that is greater than the sum of its individual components. Management \nof patients with hypertension should consider the individual’s absolute CHD risk. \n(Refer Table 3-D Risk Stratification) The decision to initiate drug treatment should \ntake this into consideration.\nAlthough the recommended target is <140/90 mmHg, in those at high CV risk \nin whom it is deemed safe on clinical grounds, and in whom drug therapy is well \ntolerated, aiming for a lower blood pressure may be considered.116,117,194(Level 1)\nClinical studies have also shown that coronary events in hypertensive patients with \nCHD are reduced in those whose blood pressure is controlled.195(Level 1) Based on \nmany studies using different groups of antihypertensives, the benefits are achieved \npredominantly by lowering the blood pressure rather than the use of any specific \nclass of antihypertensive agent.96,196,197(Level 1) \nThere are clinical trials showing morbidity and mortality benefits of anti-hypertensive \nagents such as ß-blockers, ACEIs and ARBs,198-200(Level 1) following myocardial \ninfarction.

In these patients, ACE inhibitors and ß-blockers \nare recommended for initial therapy. ß-blockers are contraindicated in the presence \nof acute heart failure. Careful monitoring for hyperkalaemia is recommended when \ncombining an aldosterone antagonist with an ACEI or ARB. The evidence for ARB is \nless convincing211 but they may be used for ACEI intolerant patients.212-218\nIn patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction >50% (HFpEF), blood \npressure control is important. For these patients, results with ARBs have been \nmixed.213,215 Several randomised control trials evaluating the efficacy of ARBs found \nno effect on prognosis including all-cause mortality.

Existing antihypertensive medications during the acute phase of \nstroke should be deferred until patients have suitable enteral access and are \nmedically and neurologically stable.265 (Level III)\nIn cases where acute BP reduction is indicated, BP lowering should be done \ncautiously targeting BP reduction of 10 to 20% from the baseline BP over \n24 hours. More profound BP reductions (>20%) have been associated with \nneurological and functional worsening.270 BP management in patients for \nthrombolysis/thrombectomy will not be discussed in this guideline (Discussed \nin the ischaemic stroke CPG).\n7.4.2.2 Haemorrhagic Stroke (HS)\nCurrent recommendations for treatment of elevated BP levels in patients with \nacute HS are more aggressive than those with IS271(Level III) (Table 7.4-A).

The INTERACT2 trial has shown no increase in death \nor serious adverse events from early intensive BP lowering in eligible patients \nwith elevated SBP. INTERACT2273(Level 1) trial and subsequent meta-analysis274 \nhave suggested that acute aggressive lowering of SBP to ≤140 mmHg within 3-6 \nhours of onset provide some evidence to indicate improved functional recovery. \nThe more recent ATACH-II trial enrolled patients within 4.5 hours of ICH onset. \nThey were randomly assigned to blood pressure reduction with intravenous \nnicardipine to achieve systolic pressures in the range of 140 to 179 mmHg \n(standard care) or 110 to 139 mmHg (intensive blood pressure lowering).

The definition of hypertension in the older adult (>65 \nyears old) is the same as that of the general adult population. Hypertension is an \nincreasingly important public health concern as our population ages. The prevalence \nof hypertension in adults >65 in Malaysia has been reported to be 71.7%,288 and the \nproportion of older adults in Malaysia is expected to increase from 9.0% in 2017 to 15% \nof the total population by 2030.289\nHypertension magnifies the risk for cardiovascular disease, with each 20 \nmmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and 10 mmHg increase in diastolic \nBP associated with a doubling in risk of death from stroke and coronary artery \ndisease.255 In older adults, the risk of cardiovascular events and death is twice as \nthat observed in younger individuals at same levels of BP.4 SBP increases linearly \nwith age, leading to an increase in prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension \nin the older adult. SBP is a better predictor of cardiovascular events than DBP.290 \nTreatment of hypertension in the older adult, particularly of high SBP, significantly \nreduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular \nevents (myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke).6,79,83,113,117,151,253,262,263,287,291-295(Level 1) \nThere is evidence that this benefit extends to even the very elderly (>80 years old).113(Level1)\nDespite the profusion of published data, there remains ongoing debate regarding \noptimal management of BP in the older adults, with various guidelines espousing \ndifferent targets and treatment recommendations. The term ‘hypertension in older \nadults’ itself causes some difficulty as it encompasses the age groups of the ‘young-\nold’ (65-70 years) to the ‘old-old’ (>80 years). This group of patients is extremely \nheterogeneous with regards to comorbidities, frailty, and physical and cognitive \nfunctioning. Hypertension trials are also widely variable in terms of age cut-offs, \ninclusion and exclusion criteria, patient cardiovascular risk profiles, treatment regimens \nand method of BP measurement.\nCurrent evidence supports treating the older adult to a target SBP of <150 mmHg to \nimprove all cardiovascular outcomes.6,113,262,293(Level 1) There is some evidence that targeting \na SBP of <140 mmHg may be beneficial, especially in reducing risk of stroke,296,297 whilst \na recent trial supports even stricter targets (SBP <130 mmHg).117(Level 1)\n7.5.1 Considerations in the Older Adults\nHypertension management in older adults are often complicated by the various \npathologies associated with aging. There are numerous challenges including multiple \ncomorbidities, postural hypotension, falls, functional and cognitive impairment and \nfrailty. These conditions frequently overlap. The absolute benefit of aggressive BP \ntreatment in older adults with multiple comorbidities and frailty is not well known.\n7.5 Hypertension in the Older Adults\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)\n77",

Therefore, it is important to critically \nevaluate the need for each medication.\n7.5.1.3 Postural Hypotension and Falls\nAdvancing age is associated with an independent increase in prevalence of \npostural hypotension. Postural hypotension is defined as a sustained reduction in \nSBP of at least 20 mmHg or DBP of 10 mmHg from lying to standing position.317 \nIn symptomatic older adults it is recommended to check BP up to 3 minutes of \nstanding. Both uncontrolled hypertension, especially ISH, and aggressive BP \ntreatment have been associated with postural hypotension.318-322(Level II-1) Postural \nhypotension, symptomatic or not, is associated with falls in older adults.318,323,324(Level II-2) \nLess strict BP targets may therefore be acceptable in the very elderly, the frail, \nthose with multimorbidities and previous fallers.322(Level III)\n7.5.1.4 Cognition\nIn addition to cardiovascular disease, another pertinent health concern for the \nageing Malaysian population is cognitive decline and dementia.

Hypertension in midlife (40-65 years old) has been \nfound in longitudinal studies to be a risk factor for developing cognitive decline \nin later life. Hypertension predisposes mainly to development of vascular \ncognitive impairment, but has also been found to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s \npathology.325,326(Level II-2)\nEvidence from randomised controlled trials on the effect of antihypertensive \ntreatment on incident cognitive decline and dementia in older adults has \nlargely been negative, due to most trials being of insufficient duration,6,295,327-329 \nalthough observational studies of up to 20 years suggest a benefit.301 Conversely, \nobservational data suggest that aggressive treatment of hypertension (to <130 \nmmHg SBP and <70 mmHg DBP) in older adults is associated with increased risk \nof new-onset cognitive impairment,301,325,326 and more rapid cognitive decline in \nindividuals with established dementia.330\n7.5.1.5 Frailty\nFrailty increases in the older adult, especially in those over 80.331 It is defined as \nincreased vulnerability to physical stressors as a result of reduced physiological \nreserve.332 The HYVET trial showed benefit of treating hypertension in adults >80 \nyears of age and did not find any effect of frailty on the benefit of hypertensive \ntreatment. However, it should be noted that HYVET excluded the very frail. \nPost-hoc analysis of the SHEP trial333(Level II-1) found that the benefit of treatment \non cardiovascular and all-cause mortality disappeared in those with functional \nimpairment. Observational studies have also demonstrated the importance of \nfrailty status on hypertension and outcomes.301,303(Level II-2) Therefore, results from \nthe HYVET and SPRINT trials which support treatment in the very elderly and \nintensive therapy respectively need to be interpreted with caution. Goals should \nbe driven by patients’ functional status and comorbidities.\n7.5.2 Assessment\nRecommendations for BP measurements in older adults are similar to those for the \ngeneral population. If there is presence of postural hypotension, the standing BP is \nused to guide treatment decisions.\nIt is very important to ascertain hypertension and the true level of BP before \ncommencing or adding pharmacological therapy. We advocate multiple readings \nusing an automated office blood pressure monitor after up to 3 minutes of quiet \nrest.\nEvaluation of older patients with hypertension should not differ from that of younger \nadult populations.

Healthcare \nproviders must be mindful that in older adults, additional aspects must be \nconsidered before starting therapy. These include frailty, physical and cognitive \nfunctioning, and tolerance to treatment. Less strict BP targets may be considered \nin certain situations.\n•\t Treatment of hypertension in the older adult, particularly of high SBP, \nsignificantly reduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular \nmortality, and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, heart failure \nand stroke), even in the very elderly.\n•\t There is strong evidence of benefit for treating to target SBP <150 \nmmHg.\n•\t There is some evidence for treating to even lower target SBPs in certain \nsubgroups of older adults.\n•\t Older patients with multimorbidities, cognitive or functional impairment \nand frailty are under represented in randomised control trials for \nhypertension. Observational studies suggest worse outcomes in these \npatients.\n•\t Measure standing BP and use it to guide treatment decision. (Grade C)\n•\t Assess comprehensively to confirm hypertension. (Grade C)\n•\t Assess for frailty, mobility, function, cognition, nutrition, postural \nhypotension and falls. (Grade C)\n•\t Individualised treatment based on clinical scenarios. (Grade C)\n•\t Target SBP <150 mmHg for >80 year olds. (Grade A)\n•\t Target SBP <140 mmHg for 65-80 year olds. (Grade B)\n•\t Consider SBP <130 mmHg in fit 65-80 year olds.

An obstetrician should lead the joint \nmanagement of women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.\n1.\t Preconception counseling and adjustment of treatment in women with \nchronic hypertension.\nWomen with chronic hypertension may require a change in the type of anti-\nhypertensive agent used pre-pregnancy.345(Level III) The drugs of choice in \npregnancy are methyldopa and labetalol (Table 7.6-A). Atenolol has been \nshown to lead to fetal growth restriction. The use of ARBs, ACEIs and thiazide \ndiuretics are associated with fetal anomaly and are therefore contraindicated \nin pregnancy.346 Women in the reproductive age group requiring these drugs \nshould be on effective contraception. In the event of unplanned pregnancy, \nthe drugs must be stopped.347\nIt should be noted that the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy is solely \nfor maternal safety particularly for prevention of intracranial bleeding. It does \nnot reduce the risk of development of preeclampsia or perinatal mortality, \nnor improve fetal growth.348 There is still no clear evidence on the target \nBP that should be achieved prior to or during pregnancy. A recent study \ncomparing less tight (target DBP of 100 mmHg) against tight (target DBP 85 \nmmHg) control of BP in women with non-proteinuric chronic hypertension or \ngestational hypertension showed no significant differences between these \ntwo groups with regard to both maternal and perinatal complications.349\nRisk\nRisk Factors\nModerate349\n•\t primigravida\n•\t age >40 years\n•\t pregnancy interval >10 years\n•\t body mass index of >35 kg/m2 at first visit\n•\t family history of PE\n•\t multiple pregnancy\nHigh349\n•\t hypertensive disease during previous pregnancy\n•\t chronic kidney disease\n•\t autoimmune disease such as Systemic Lupus \nErythematosus (SLE) or anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS)\n•\t type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and\n•\t chronic hypertension\n2.\tRecognition of women at risk of preeclampsia for commencement of \nprophylaxis.\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)\n85",

This will prevent delay \nin referral. Any patient with preeclampsia should be closely monitored, as the \nprogression to severe preeclampsia is unpredictable and rapid.\nIn the event of an acute hypertensive crisis, IV hydralazine, IV labetalol, or \noral nifedipine, may be used to lower the BP.365,366(Level I) Sublingual nifedipine \nis no longer recommended (Table 7.6-B).367(Level III) Diuretics are generally \ncontraindicated as they reduce plasma volume, may cause Intrauterine Growth \nRestriction (IUGR) and may possibly increase perinatal mortality. Their only use \nis in the treatment of acute pulmonary oedema.341(Level III) In order to reduce the \nrisk of maternal stroke, the blood pressure should be reduced within 30-60 \nminutes.368\n7.6.1.5 Anticonvulsants in Preeclampsia-Eclampsia\nParenteral magnesium sulphate is currently the drug of choice for the prevention \nof eclampsia and to abort an eclamptic fit (Table 7.6-C).367,369(Level 1) The alternative \nis intravenous diazepam, bearing in mind that it is inferior in efficacy compared to \nmagnesium sulphate. Magnesium sulphate also provides fetal neuroprotection \nfollowing preterm birth with a significant reduction in the incidence of cerebral \npalsy.370\n7.6.1.6 Postpartum Care\nPostpartum, women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are advised to \nhave their BP checked regularly at local clinics if there is a significant delay \nin their scheduled hospital follow-up.

Direct cost \nincludes the cost of treatment (drugs, investigations, healthcare providers time and \ntransportation) whereas indirect cost measures the income lost due to hypertension \nand its complications. A difficult to measure indirect cost would be the cost to society \nin managing patients with sequelae of hypertension (e.g. managing patients with a \nhypertensive bleed, hypertensive heart and renal failure). \nA study in a primary care setting showed that more than half of treatment cost is driven \nby antihypertensive medications. This cost increases as the severity of hypertension \nincreases.409,410 The direct cost to the Ministry of Health for antihypertensive medication \nhas steadily increased from RM570.3 million in 2014 to RM608.8 million in 2016.411\nThe direct and indirect cost for hypertensive complications is not available for Malaysia. \nA study in Malaysia showed that the estimated direct cost for complications in patients \nwith diabetes for the outcomes of stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure to be \nas high as RM12,685 per admission.

Diuretics work \nvia inducing natriuresis which alter long term sodium balance, leading to reduced \nperipheral vascular resistance and sustained blood pressure reduction. Diuretics provide \nsynergistic effect to almost all anti-hypertensive agents, particularly renin-angiotensin \nsystem (RAS) blockers. There were also outcome data that supported the potential \ncardiovascular benefits of thiazide diuretics, particularly in those with preserved renal \nfunction.419 (Level 1)\nThiazide diuretics are classified into thiazide (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-\nlike diuretics, e.g. chlorthalidone (CTD) and indapamide. Locally, hydrochlorothiazide \n(HCTZ) is the most commonly used thiazide diuretic. Most positive outcome studies \nused thiazide-like diuretics, i.e. chlorthalidone5,89 and indapamide.113 Even though there \nwere no head to head trials comparing HCTZ and CTD, a systematic review and network \nmeta-analyses reported superiority of CTD to HCTZ in preventing cardiovascular \nevents. This difference might be attributed to the pleomorphic effects of CTD or to the \nshorter duration of action of HCTZ.420(Level II-1)\nHCTZ is effective in the range of 12.5mg – 50mg daily dose.421(Level II-1) However a dose \nabove 25mg per day is more likely to cause electrolyte and metabolic adverse effects. \nThe major out come data for the use of thiazide-like diuretics (CTD) was from ALLHAT \nstudy.89(Level II-1) Chlorthalidone-based regimen was equally effective in reducing clinical \noutcome as lisinopril and amlodipine. In chronic kidney disease with eGFR<30ml/\nmin/1.73m2, thiazide diuretics are less effective and a switch to loop diuretics is \nrecommended. \nA recent case-control study highlighted a significant increase in the risk of skin and lip \nsquamous cell carcinoma among thiazide diuretics users.422,423 (Level II-2) There was a clear \ndose-response effect with the highest cumulative dose of HCTZ having the highest risk. \nThere was more than 7-fold increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma for a cumulative \nuse of ≥200,000 mg HCTZ (equivalent to 50mg daily for a duration of more than 11 \nyears). Even though this is an observational study, the risk is not negligible.\nTypes of Antihypertensive Agents\n9\n102\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)",

They are \nparticularly useful in hypertensive patients with effort angina, tachyarrhythmias or \nprevious myocardial infarction where they have been shown to reduce cardiovascular \nmorbidity and mortality. Certain ß-blockers have been shown to be beneficial in \npatients with heart failure. (Table 5-C)\nBeta-blockers are absolutely contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled asthma \nand relatively contraindicated in other forms of obstructive airways disease (including \ncontrolled bronchial asthma). It is also absolutely contraindicated in patients with severe \nperipheral vascular disease and heart block (2nd and 3rd degree).\nThey are generally well tolerated. Adverse effects reported include dyslipidaemia, \nmasking of hypoglycaemia, and increased incidence of new onset diabetes mellitus. \nDespite that, a long-term follow-up of a study in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes \nshowed that the benefit of ß-blocker persisted and is even better than an ACEI.424(Level II-2) \nOther reported adverse events include erectile dysfunction, cold extremities and \nnightmares (especially for lipophilic ß-blockers), increased triglyceride levels and \nreduced HDL levels (especially for non-selective ß-blockers). Use of ß-blockers during \npregnancy is cautioned.\nIn a major landmark study, an ARB was shown to be superior than ß-blocker in patients \nwith high risk hypertension and ECG LVH112 (Level 1) This prompted a meta-analysis on the \nuse of ß-blockers in the treatment of hypertension.92 Beta-blocker therapy did not reduce \nthe risk for first myocardial infarction compared to other drugs but was associated with \na significant 16% higher risk for stroke when compared to non- ß-blocker therapy and \nthat atenolol in particular was associated with a significant 26% increase in the risk of \nstroke when compared to other anti-hypertensive agents.

The strategy is to either \nblock aldosterone production (aldosterone synthase inhibitors) or to block its \nreceptor (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). \nThe prototypes of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists would be \nspironolactone and eplerenone. Finerenone is the latest in this class and is \ncurrently undergoing phase III trials, not only for hypertension but also for \ndiabetic nephropathy and heart failure. Because it has low affinity for steroid \nreceptors, there is a lower incidence of gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction, \nand reduced libido.\n2.\t Those targeting the classical RAS. These would include angiotensin converting \nenzyme 2 activators, angiotensin type 2 receptor agonists and vaccines against \nthe angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors.\n3.\t Centrally acting aminopeptidase inhibitors to inhibit excessive sympathetic \noutflow from the brain.\n4.\t Vasopeptidase inhibitors which degrade natriuretic peptides.\n5.\t Dual-acting angiotensin receptor–neprilysin Inhibitors.
