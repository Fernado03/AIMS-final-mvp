There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review \nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane \nDatabase of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines \nInternational Network. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy. The inclusion criterion was patients suspected and diagnosed \nwith OSA. The exclusion criteria were complex sleep apnoea syndrome \n(e.g. overlap syndrome etc.) and other sleep disorders e.g. narcolepsy, \ninsomnia etc.  The search was limited to literature published in the last \n10 years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of \nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in the \nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted \nfrom November 2020 to 31 May 2022. The literature search was \nrepeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development \nprocess allowing any relevant papers published before 31 May 2022 \nto be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published \nafter this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines as listed below: \n•\t Treatment of Adult Obstructive Sleep Apnea with Positive Airway \nPressure: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine Clinical \nPractice Guideline (2021)\n•\t Use of polysomnography and home sleep apnea tests for the \nlongitudinal management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: An \nAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical guidance statement \n(2021) \n•\t Referral of adults with obstructive sleep apnea for surgical \nconsultation: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical \npractice guideline (2021) \n•\t Evaluation and Management of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome: \nAn Official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline \n(2019)\n•\t Clinical Practice Guideline for Diagnostic Testing for Adult \nObstructive Sleep Apnea: An American Academy of Sleep \nMedicine Clinical Practice Guideline (2017)\n•\t Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Guidelines on \nPreoperative Screening and Assessment of Adult Patients With \nObstructive Sleep (2016)",

Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. \nThe DG members met 22 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nLiterature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian \nPreventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001) while the \ngrading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE \n(refer to page i). The writing of the CPG follows strictly the requirements \nof AGREE II.\nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external \nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for \nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to \nthe Technical Advisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology \nAssessment (HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and \napproval.

            "text": "Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\n1\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nObstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep-related breathing \ndisorder caused by repetitive upper airway collapse resulting in partial \nor complete breathing cessation. Symptoms include unrefreshed sleep, \ndaytime sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, awakening with a gasping \nor choking sensation and loud snoring. Sleep disordered breathing \n(SDB) and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) are commonly \ndescribed as OSA in the literature. For the purpose of this document, \nwe will use OSA as the referring terminology. \n \nThis disease affects both children and adults and is associated with \nsignificant morbidity.  A recent review estimated that nearly one billion \nadults aged 30 - 69 years worldwide could have OSA. The number \nof people with moderate to severe OSA in whom treatment was \nhighly recommended was estimated to be at least 425 million.1, level III \nIn children,  the prevalence of OSA was reported to be up to 5.7%. \nObesity was identified as an independent risk factor for OSA in this \ngroup.2, level I Early recognition and treatment are essential in preventing \nsequelae from OSA. This medical condition increases all cause and \ncardiovascular (CV)-related mortality predominantly among the middle-\naged group. It is also associated with other co-morbidities including \nmetabolic and cognitive consequences. Therefore, it is important to be \naware of the disease and updated with its management. \n \nThe management of OSA has evolved since its discovery in 1965, \nespecially after  the introduction of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure \n(CPAP) therapy via nasal mask in 1981 as a form of treatment for OSA. \nTo date, there is no specific local CPG addressing the management \nof OSA. Thus, it is timely to have the first Malaysian CPG on OSA to \nguide local healthcare providers in managing this common disorder. It \nwill provide a standard framework for the management of OSA based \non the latest evidence available.",

Fiber-optic nasal endoscopy with Muller’s \nManoeuver (FNMM) has been used as a method to assess upper airway \nobstruction. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) has recently been \nintroduced for such assessment. However, it requires deep sedation \nand involvement of anaesthetists, and thus may pose challenges in \ncarrying out the procedure in the local setting.

There were significant \ndifferences in the detection of retrolingual collapse identified via DISE \ncompared with FNMM.27 - 29, level III \nThe CPG DG opines that DISE is more accurate than FNMM in \ndetermining the degree of upper airway obstruction prior to sleep \nsurgery based on case series.  \n•\t If DISE is unable to be performed prior to surgery, FNMM may still be \noffered as an alternative procedure to identify the level and degree \nof obstruction.  \n3.3\t Treatment\nManagement of adult OSA patients include lifestyle modification, \nweight management, PAP therapy, oral appliance therapy and surgical \nprocedures.

In neonates or infants with severe airway \nobstruction, a tracheostomy tube to bypass the obstructed upper airway \nis necessary until corrective surgery can be performed.139 - 140, level III\nSurgical treatment of OSA in CA children include mandibular\ndistraction osteogenesis, AT and rapid maxillary expansion. Evidence \nhave shown that OSA has improved in these children after these \nsurgeries.133, level III; 140 - 142, level III\nRecommendation 21\n•\t Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and craniofacial anomalies \nshould be assessed for the benefit and risk of a surgical intervention.\nNon-surgical treatment using nasal CPAP and oxygen therapy may be \nuseful if surgery is not possible or in mild to moderate OSA. Medications \nlike proton pump inhibitor may also be used.141; level III; 143 - 144 level III\n5.3\t Down Syndrome\nPatients with Down syndromes (DS) are known to be at high risk for \nOSA. The prevalence of OSA in DS varies from 45% to 82%. There are \nmultiple factors to explain the increased prevalence of OSA in DS which \ninclude differences in anatomy and physiology. Soft tissue crowding of \nthe pharynx and palate caused by midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia \nis further exacerbated by an increased incidence of adenotonsillar \nhypertrophy, relative macroglossia and glossoptosis, laryngomalacia, \nand subglottic and tracheal stenosis. Due to its high prevalence, \nscreening and treatment for this group of patients are strongly \nsupported.145, level III",

Of those \nwith ongoing monitoring, 78.0% had moderate or severe OSA at \nsome time.146, level III\nTreatment of OSA in DS includes pharmacotherapy, CPAP and surgery. \nAT is one of the mainstay treatments of OSA in this group.

Several \nfactors may affect the implementation of recommendations in the \nCPG. OSA is best managed by a multidisciplinary approach to ensure \nsuccess of treatment and reduction of complications. \n6.1\t Facilitating and Limiting Factors \nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in this CPG \ninclude: \n•\t availability of CPG to health care providers (hard copies and soft \ncopies/online)\n•\t regular seminars/conferences/courses for health care providers \non management of OSA including those involving professional \nbodies (e.g. Sleep Disorder Society Malaysia, Malaysian Thoracic \nSociety, Malaysia Society of Oral, Head and Neck Surgery and \nFamily Medicine Specialist Association)\n•\t public awareness activities during World Sleep Day including the \ninvolvement of governmental/non-governmental organisations \ne.g. Gabungan Persatuan Pemandu Pengangkutan Darat \nMalaysia, Malaysian Pilots Association\n•\t accessibility to relevant multidisciplinary teams\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n•\t limited awareness and understanding/knowledge in managing \nOSA among health care providers\n•\t variation in clinical management and preferences\n•\t insufficient resources in terms of budget, expertise, access to \ndiagnostic tests, medications and treatment options \n•\t misconception about the disease and its management by the \npublic\n6.2\t Potential Resource Implications \nOSA is a prevalent disease and underdiagnosed in Malaysia. It is a \nchronic disorder associated with several cardio-metabolic complications, \nneurocognitive impairment, increased motor vehicle accidents and \nreduced productivity when untreated. Hence, early diagnosis and \nprompt management of OSA can improve its outcomes. \nAs OSA is the commonest sleep-related breathing disorder, its \nmanagement should be emphasised throughout all levels of care. \nTherefore, implementation of nation-wide screening among high-risk \ngroup e.g. with STOP-BANG questionnaire is important. Those at high \nrisk should be provided with health education and advice on lifestyle \nmodifications to prevent complications of the disease.",

The purpose of the system is to assess and communicate \na patient’s pre-anesthesia medical co-morbidities. The classification \nsystem alone does not predict the perioperative risks, but used with \nother factors (e.g. type of surgery, frailty, level of deconditioning), it can \nbe helpful in predicting perioperative risks.\n  \nThe definitions and examples shown in the table below are guidelines \nfor the clinician. To improve communication and assessments at a \nspecific institution, anesthesiology departments may choose to develop \ninstitutional-specific examples to supplement the ASA-approved \nexamples.   \nAssigning a Physical Status Classification level is a clinical decision \nbased on multiple factors. While the classification may initially be \ndetermined at various times during the preoperative assessment of \nthe patient, the final assignment of Physical Status Classification is \nmade on the day of anaesthesia care by the anaesthesiologist after \nevaluating the patient.   \nASA PS  \nClassification\nDefinition\nAdult examples,\nincluding but not\nlimited to:\nPaediatric examples, \nincluding but not \nlimited\nObstetric examples,\nincluding but not \nlimited to:\nHealthy, non- \nsmoking, no or \nminimal alcohol use\nHealthy (no acute or \nchronic disease), normal\nBMI percentile for age\nA normal \nhealthy patient\nASA I\nSubstantive functional  \nlimitations; one or more\nmoderate to severe \ndiseases.  \nPoorly controlled  \nDM or HTN, COPD, \nmorbid obesity (BMI ≥40),\nactive hepatitis, \nUncorrected stable \ncongenital cardiac \nabnormality, asthma with  \nexacerbation, poorly-\ncontrolled epilepsy,\ninsulin dependent DM, \nmorbid obesity, \nmalnutrition, severe OSA,\nA patient with  \nsevere systemic\ndisease\nASA III\nASA Il\nNormal pregnancy*, \nwell-controlled \ngestational HTN, \ncontrolled \npreeclampsia without \nsevere features,  \ndiet-controlled \ngestational DM\nAsymptomatic  \ncongenital cardiac\ndisease, well-controlled \ndysrhythmias, asthma \nwithout exacerbation,  \nwell-controlled epilepsy,\nnon-insulin dependent\nDM, abnormal BMI \npercentile for age, mild/\nmoderate OSA, \noncologic state in \nremission, autism with \nmild limitations\nMild diseases only \nwithout substantive  \nfunctional limitations. \nCurrent smoker, social  \nalcohol drinker, \npregnancy, obesity \n(30<BMI<40), well-\ncontrolled DM/HTN, \nmild lung disease\nA patient with \nmild systemic \ndisease\nPreeclampsia with \nsevere features,\ngestational DM with \ncomplications or high \ninsulin requirements, a  \nthrombophilic disease  \nrequiring anticoagulation",
