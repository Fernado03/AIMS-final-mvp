There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines \nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans, \n“all adults (19 plus years)”, publication from year “2009 to Current” and \nEnglish language. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature \nand guidelines were searched and, experts in the field contacted to \nidentify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 19 Nov \n2018 to 26 Feb 2019. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 30 June 2021 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on schizophrenia e.g.:\n•\t Practice Guideline for The Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia \n(Third Edition) [The American Psychiatric Association (APA), \n2021]\n•\t Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Adults [National Institute for \nHealth and Care Excellence (NICE), 2014]\n•\t Management of Schizophrenia [Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines \nNetwork (SIGN), 2013]\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of 35 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG \nmembers met 33 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed at each DG meeting.

This CPG was developed largely \nbased on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical \ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of \nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows \nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external \nreviewers.

            "text": "1\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nSchizophrenia is a term that describes a major psychiatric disorder \nthat alters an individual’s perception, thought, affect and behaviour. \nGlobally, it was ranked as the 11th leading cause of disability in 2013.1 \nIn the Second Report of the National Mental Health Registry on \nSchizophrenia in 2003 to 2005, the incidence rate of schizophrenia in \nMalaysia was stated as 5 cases/100,000 population/year. However, the \nexpected rate was 100 cases/100,000 population/year and possible \nreasons for low reported incidence were delayed or under reporting and \nadministrative reasons. The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was \nlong with a mean of 28.7 months and longer among females. The clinical \nimportance of DUP was that it was one of the few prognostic factors \nwhich can be altered through changes in health service delivery.2 This \nemphasises the value of early recognition and the necessity for early \nreferral and intervention including during prodromal period.\nAlthough the prevalence of schizophrenia worldwide was low,3 its \nimpact on health, social and economy are tremendous for patients, \nfamilies/caregivers and society.  In an economic evaluation in Malaysia, \nbased on a total estimated number of treated cases of 15,104, the total \neconomic burden of treatment for schizophrenia stood at USD100 \nmillion which was equivalent to 0.04% of the national gross domestic \nproduct. On average, the mean cost per patient was USD6,594. Of \nthe total economic burden, 72% was attributed to indirect cost (USD72 \nmillion), followed by direct medical cost at 26% and the remaining on \ndirect non-medical cost.4 This huge magnitude of this disease burden is \nvital for policymakers to prioritise service for schizophrenia. \nWorldwide, mental health services have experienced a series of \nparadigm shifts along with the development of medical technologies \nand the human rights movements where the services are delivered in \nthe community.5; 6 The community-based mental health service takes \ninto account the fact that people with schizophrenia face difficulties \nin essential issues e.g. employment, housing, and relationship \nwith families and friends,6; 7 besides stigma and discrimination. Ideally, \nsuch service should include care and treatment delivered close to\nhome.8, level III In Malaysia, efforts on integrating the care for mentally \nill patients in the community have started since 1997 as outlined in \nthe National Mental Health Policy.9; 10 Subsequently, the development \nof community mental health centre (CMHC) begun in 2011. CMHC, \nor Mentari as it is branded in Malaysia, is a centre for treatment and \ncare of mental health that offers screening, diagnosis, treatment \nand rehabilitation of any person suffering from any mental disorder \nin accordance with the Mental Health Act 2001 and Mental Health \nRegulation 2010.11",
