There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nThe previous CPG entitled Management of Osteoarthritis 2002 was \nused as the basis for the development of the present guidelines. \nA literature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N); World Health \nOrganization (WHO), Medline via Ovid, Pubmed, Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and International Health Technology \nAssessment websites (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published in the last ten \nyears, on humans and in English. If the evidence was insufficient, the \nperiod of publication was extended for another ten years. In addition, the \nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to \nfurther identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted \nto identify further studies. All searches were conducted from 27 October \n2011 to 27 September 2012. Literature searches were repeated for all \nclinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing \nany relevant papers published before 31 July 2013 to be included. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other CPG on Osteoarthritis such as The \nNational Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions (2008) & National \nInstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2008) â€“ Osteoarthritis: \nNational Clinical Guideline for Care and Management in Adults. The \nCPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and \nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.\nA total of 14 clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions) \nThe DG members met 28 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed",

This may arise as a result of biomechanical, \nbiochemical and/or genetic factors. The process may involve one or \nmultiple joints. \nIn the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study, it was estimated that \n251 million people suffered from knee OA worldwide. Musculoskeletal \ndiseases which included OA was the second greatest cause of disability \nas measured by years lived with disability.1\nOA is prevalent in the ageing population. In 2010, WHO estimated that \n524 million people were aged 65 or older and this number is expected \nto triple which represents 16% of the worldâ€™s population by 2050.2\nIn view of its potential public health burden and emergence of more \nrecent advances in the management of OA, it is timely to update the \nCPG on Management of OA 2002 using evidence-based methodology. \nIt is hoped that this CPG serves as a useful guide in the daily practice \nof health care providers in various disciplines from the public, academic \nand private sectors.",

The most commonly used \ncase definition is radiographic OA, symptomatic OA and self-reported \nOA. Symptomatic OA is defined as the presence of the radiographic \nfeatures of OA in combination with symptoms attributable to it. Not all \nindividuals with radiographic OA have concomitant symptoms; thus \nradiographic OA has the highest prevalence.3, level III\na. \t Hand OA\nIn the Framingham Osteoarthritis Hand OA study, the mean baseline \nage was 58.9 years. The age-standardised prevalence of hand OA was \nhigher in women (44.2%) than men (37.7%). The prevalence was even \nhigher in erosive (9.9% vs 3.3%) and symptomatic (15.9% vs 8.2%) \nhand OA. Majority of women (96.4%) and men (91.4%) with hand OA \nat baseline showed progression at 9-year follow up.4, level II-2\nb.\t Hip OA\nThe prevalence of symptomatic hip OA in United States of America\n(USA) was 9.2% among adults age >45 with a slight female \npreponderance.5, level III In another study, the crude prevalence of \nradiographic hip OA in Chinese aged 60 - 89 years was 0.9% in women \nand 1.1% in men. Hip OA was 80 - 90% less frequent in the Chinese \nthan white persons in the USA.6, level III\nc. \t Knee OA\nIn the Johnston County OA Project of USA, the lifetime risk of developing \nsymptomatic knee OA in at least one knee was 44.7% (95% CI 40.0% \nto 49.3%) by age 85 years. The lifetime risk is higher in those with \nhistory of knee injury and increased BMI.7, level II-2\nThe prevalence of symptomatic knee OA was 4.9% among adults age \n>26 years in the Framingham study,5, level III 16.7% among adults age \n>45 in the Johnston County study,7,  level II-2 and 12.1% among adults \naged >60 in the NHANES III study.5, level III\nIn the Beijing Osteoarthritis Study of persons aged 60 years and above, \nthe prevalence of radiographic knee OA was 42.8% in women and",

Compared with women of the same age in Framingham, \nwomen in Beijing had a higher prevalence of radiographic knee OA \n(prevalence ratio=1.45, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.60) and of symptomatic knee \nOA (prevalence ratio=1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.75). The prevalence of knee \nOA in Chinese men was similar to that in their white USA counterparts \n(prevalence ratio of 0.90 for radiographic OA and 1.02 for symptomatic \nOA). Possible explanations for these differences range from genetic \ndifferences to heavy physical activity among Chinese.8, level III\nIn the Community Orientated Program for the control of Rheumatic \nDisease (COPCORD) study in Malaysia which was initiated by ILAR \nand WHO, 9.3% of adult Malaysians had knee pain and more than half \nof those examined had clinical evidence of OA. The prevalence ranged \nfrom 1.1% to 5.6% in the various ethnic groups. This prevalence is likely \nto be an underestimate as the study only included those with pain in the \npast week and not all subjects with knee pain attended the subsequent \nmedical examination. Hip pain was less common, with only 2.2% of the \nstudy population affected.9, level III\nTo better understand the burden of disease, further epidemiological \nstudies are needed to obtain the prevalence and incidence of OA in \nMalaysia.\n2.2 \tRisk Factors\nMultiple risk factors have been associated with the development and \nprogression of OA.

However, \nthere are diagnostic criteria by American College of Rheumatology and \nEuropean League Against Rheumatism which can be used as a guide.\n4.1 \tClinical Features\nClinical features of OA depend on the extent of the disease. Patients \nmay have radiological evidence of OA without clinical symptoms. \nSymptoms of OA include:-\ni.\t\nJoint pain - Pain is the most common presenting complaint. It is \nusually insidious in onset, of variable intensity through the day, \nmay be intermittent and relapsing, increased by joint use and \nimpact and relieved by rest. Night pain may occur in severe OA. \nRefer to Appendix 3 for possible mechanisms of pain in OA.\nii.\t\nStiffness - Stiffness may be defined as a sensation of tightening \nof the involved joint that usually occurs after inactivity, such as in \nthe morning or when arising after sitting for a prolonged period. \nIn contrast to inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, \nstiffness in OA usually lasts only a few minutes and almost always \nless than 30 minutes.\niii.\t Swelling - There may be fullness and swelling of the joint with or \nwithout associated warmth and loss of function.\niv.\t Gait disturbance - OA of weight-bearing joints if significant is \nassociated with gait disturbance, increased muscle spasm and \na reduced quality of life. An affected knee or hip can produce a \nprominent limp. Impaired function of a weight-bearing joint will \ncause added stress on the contralateral weight-bearing joints, for \nexample a patient with impaired right knee function and pain will \nhave difficulty with the left hip and vice versa.\nv.\t\nBony swelling - In hand OA, hypertrophic bone formation in the \ninterphalangeal joint may result in reduced dexterity and difficulty \nin performing fine movements such as sewing. OA of the first \ncarpometacarpal (CMC) joint may result in writing difficulties.\nvi.\t Loss of muscle bulk - Inactivity secondary to pain, for example in \nknee OA, may lead to significant weakness and loss of quadriceps \nmuscle bulk.\nvii.\t Limb deformity - Enlargement of the knee joints may occur resulting \nin increasing deformity of the knees, such as â€˜knock kneesâ€™ (valgus) \nor â€˜bowingâ€™ (varus).\nviii.\t Clicking or grinding sensation - There may be a clicking or grinding \nsensation with joint motion resulting in discomfort or pain.",

However, it is most notable in the interphalangeal joints \nof the hands with enlargement and subluxation, the first CMC \njoint, the knees (varus/valgus) or the hips (shortened extremity). \nDeformity may be associated with joint fusion or instability.\n4.2 \tDiagnostic Criteria \nThe diagnostic criteria for classification of OA are based on the American \nCollege of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

Rheumatology opinion should be \nsought for evaluation of arthritis with unclear diagnosis.\n9.2 \tOrthopaedic Referral\nReferral to the orthopaedic surgeon should be made when the patient \ndoes not experience satisfactory improvement in terms of pain, stability \nor function despite adequate pharmacological and non-pharmacological \ntreatment. The patients should be made to understand the reason for \nreferral. \nRecommendation 16\nâ€¢\t Referral of osteoarthritis cases to either rheumatology or orthopaedic \nclinic should provide the following information:-\nï‚™\t Diagnosis\nï‚™\t Severity and its impact on activity of daily living\nï‚™\t Co-morbidities that might require further medical assessment\nï‚™\t Relevant investigation results and current medications (Grade C)\n10. \tPRIMARY PREVENTION\nIdentifying and modifying the risk factors can help in preventing OA and \nits progression. Many of these risk factors are of particular importance \nin weight-bearing joints. Prevention of obesity, weight reduction in the \nobese and health education pertaining to joint protection techniques \nincluding avoidance of trauma to the joints are recommended as \nmeasures for primary prevention. Currently, there is no evidence \navailable to recommend the intake of any medication to prevent OA. An \nimportant aspect of primary prevention is to identify those individuals \nat risk.",
