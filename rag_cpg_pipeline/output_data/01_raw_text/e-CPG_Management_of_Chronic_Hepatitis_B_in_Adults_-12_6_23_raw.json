There was active \ninvolvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee during the process \nof the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Embase. \nRefer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion \ncriteria are all adults at risk and with hepatitis B infection regardless of \nstudy design. The first search was limited to literature published in the \nlast 10 years (2010 - 2020) for majority of the clinical questions and on \nadults aged 19 to 44 years old and in English. In addition, the reference \nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts \nin the field were contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were \nconducted from 24 July 2020 to 30 September 2020. The literature \nsearch was repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG \ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before 31 \nJuly 2022 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence \npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can \nbe obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines on chronic hepatitis B \nin adults as listed below: \n•\t EASL 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines on The Management of \nHepatitis B Virus Infection\n•\t Update on Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Chronic \nHepatitis B: AASLD 2018 Hepatitis B Guidance\n•\t Asian-Pacific Clinical Practice Guidelines on The Management of \nHepatitis B: A 2015 Update\nA total of 17 main clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG \nmembers met 24 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and review committee (RC). Where evidence was insufficient, \nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. \nAny differences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\niv",

            "text": "1\nManagement of Chronic Hepatitis B in Adults\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nChronic Hepatitis B (CHB) is defined by the presence of hepatitis B \nsurface antigen (HBsAg) for at least six months.1; 2, level III It is a global \npublic health problem. In Malaysia, the incidence rate is approximately \n12.64 in 100,000 population.3, level III The prevalence is decreasing due to \nimprovements in socioeconomic status, universal vaccination programs \nand perhaps effective antiviral treatments.\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted by perinatal or horizontal \ntransmission, percutaneous, and sexual exposure and exposure to \ninfected blood and body fluids. HBV can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis \nand hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Screening is important, especially \nfor those at high risk.\nNon-invasive methods to assess liver fibrosis and cirrhosis e.g. the use \nof aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 \nindex (FIB-4) testing have been validated in hepatitis B and are easily \nperformed.\nThe induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents \nthe main endpoint of current treatment strategies. Functional cure \nof hepatitis B is an optimal endpoint which is defined as sustained \nundetectable circulating HBsAg and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\nAdditional indications for treatment include the prevention of mother-\nto-child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and the \nprevention of HBV reactivation in patients requiring immunosuppression \nor chemotherapy. \nThe long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) \nwith a high barrier to resistance, such as entecavir (ETV), tenofovir \ndisoproxil (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), represents the \ntreatment of choice. \nIn view of high disease burden, variation in practice and non-existence \nof local guidelines, as well as the aim of elimination of viral hepatitis by \n2030 in line with World Health Organization’s (WHO) goal, an evidence-\nbased CPG is required to guide healthcare providers locally in the \nmanagement of CHB in adults.",

However, there was no difference in the risk between \nETV and no intervention groups.

It is defined as severe \nliver injury, leading to coagulopathy (usually with an INR ≥1.5) and \nany degree of mental alteration (encephalopathy) in a patient without \npre-existing liver disease.

It may occur spontaneously, during or after \nantiviral treatment and in the setting of immunosuppression and/or \nchemotherapy. \nThe clinical spectrum of hepatitis B flares varies from asymptomatic \nto symptomatic and typical overt acute hepatitis, even with hepatic \ndecompensation or failure. Flares may also occur in viraemic cirrhotic \npatients with a higher incidence of decompensation/mortality compared \nwith those without cirrhosis, hence requiring immediate antiviral \ntreatment for prevention or rescue.31, level III",
