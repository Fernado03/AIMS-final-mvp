Specific attempts were made \nto use local data and publications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this \nguideline does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual \npatient care. Every health care provider is responsible for the management of \nhis/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation and management \noptions available locally.\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline is issued in 2016 and will be reviewed in 2021 or earlier if \nimportant new evidence becomes available.\nCPG Secretariat\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia\nAvailable on the following websites:\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadmed.org.my\nThis is an update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines on Prevention of Heart \nDisease in Women published in 2008.

            "text": "FOREWORD BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE \nMINISTRY OF HEALTH MALAYSIA\n \n2\n2016\n \nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah \nDirector-General of Health Malaysia \nCardiovascular disease, till this day, remains the primary cause \nof mortality globally. Although it affects both genders, a greater \nemphasis appears to be placed on male patients, who appear \nto develop the disease at an earlier age compared to females. \nHowever, it is also known the incidence of cardiovascular \ndisease in females rapidly rises to match males after \nmenopause. From the National Cardiovascular Disease \nRegistry in Malaysia (2011-2013), it was demonstrated that \nfemale patients had a higher in-hospital and 30-day mortality \nfor acute coronary syndrome compared to male patients. \nSuch statistics demand a greater focus being placed, not only on the diagnosis and \ntreatment, but critically on the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women in our \ncountry.\nMalaysia has a rising prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the population. \nDiabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia afflict both gender groups. Coupled with \nsmoking and other non-communicable cardiovascular risk factors, it is important to place \nequal emphasis on both gender groups in the effort to prevent cardiovascular disease. \nThe Ministry of Health is committed towards reducing the rates of non-communicable \ndiseases, including those leading to cardiovascular disease, and these Guidelines form \nan important reference point to all stakeholders.\nThe advent of newer diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has also provided the \nopportunity to improve prevention of cardiovascular disease, including in women. \nTechniques such as multislice computed tomography of the coronary arteries and \ncardiac magnetic resonance imaging provide the clinician greater options for disease \ndetection, yet each has its limitations. Contemporary strategies such as these will \nenhance the capacity of the clinician to improve both primary and secondary prevention \nof cardiovascular disease, augmenting established strategies such as the exercise \nstress test. Research in cardiovascular medicine has accelerated in recent years, and \nwith such a rapidly expanding evidence base, these updated Guidelines are timely.\nI am therefore grateful to the writing committee chaired by Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Robaayah, \nwho has no doubt put countless hours into the preparation of this Clinical Practice \nGuidelines, which is now in its second edition. While publication becomes a useful \ncompanion for clinicians, I hope it inspires more women to the field of cardiovascular \nmedicine.",

It is 2 ½ times more common \n \nas a cause of death than all cancers combined.\n• \nThe pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to myocardial ischemia \n \nin women are varied and maybe multiple. Women with angina may have:\n \n Atherosclerotic obstructive Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)- \n \n \n(coronary lesions > 50% luminal narrowing)\n \n Non-obstructive CHD (≥ 20% and < 50% luminal narrowing). The \n \n \nprognosis of these patients is not benign. It is worse if myocardial \n \n \nischemia is documented.\n \n Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (< 20% luminal \n \n \nnarrowing)\n• \nOther unique gender specific cardiac issues include:\n \n Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy\n \n Spontaneous coronary artery dissections\n• \nPresenting symptoms for CHD and stroke in women may be both typical \n \nand sometimes atypical.\n• \nPrognosis for women following a myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke is \n \npoorer than in men.\n• \nOther diseases that are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) \n \nrisk in women include:\n \n connective tissue diseases (especially rheumatoid arthritis, systemic \n \n \nlupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic vasculitis) and the drugs \n \n \nthat are used to treat these diseases\n \n chemotherapy and radiation induced cardio toxicity\n \n infections such as influenza, periodontal disease and human \n \n \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n \n obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n• \nIncreased awareness, early detection with appropriate investigations and \n \nmanagement is important.\n• \nAll women above the age of 40 years should know their CVD risk.\n• \nAssessment of CVD risk involves: \n \n History: Looking for symptoms suggestive of CHD or CHD \n \n \nEquivalents, family history of premature CHD, smoking status, \n \n \nphysical activity \n \n Physical Examination: Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist \n \n \ncircumference, pulses, blood pressure (BP)\n \n Investigations: Blood glucose, lipid profile",

The first edition was published in \n2008. This CPG has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the \nNational Heart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health and the Academy \nof Medicine. It comprises of cardiologists, endocrinologists and general \nphysicians from the government and private sectors and the Universities.  \nObjectives:\nThe objectives of these guidelines is to:\n•   Increase awareness regarding cardiovascular disease in women among \n      healthcare providers\n•     Improve the detection and management of women with cardiovascular \n      disease\n•     Update healthcare providers on women’s cardiovascular health\n•     Develop a preventive strategy for cardiovascular disease in women \nProcess:\nThe previous CPG published in 2008 was used as a base. In addition to the \nprevious clinical questions that needed to be updated, the Expert Panel \nformulated new questions that needed to be addressed. These clinical \nquestions were then divided into sections and each member was assigned \none or more topics.\nA review of current medical literature on Cardiovascular Disease in Women \nand Women’s Heart Health from 2008 (the date of the last CPG) till 30th \nAugust 2015 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the \nfollowing electronic databases – PubMed and Cochrane Database of \nSystemic Reviews.",

There are \nhowever, considerable differences in the first manifestation.21 Men are more \nlikely to develop CHD as a first event, while women are more likely to have a \nstroke or heart failure (HF) as their first event, although these manifestations \ntend to appear when they are older.21\n2.1.  Coronary Heart Disease\n2.1.1. \nPresenting Symptoms\nIn general, women present with CHD 10 to 20 years later than men.22-26 Before \nmenopause, the prevalence of CHD is low.25\nThere are gender differences in the symptoms at presentation.18,20,22 Angina \npectoris is an earlier and more common presentation in women as compared \nto men who more often present with MI.27 Women often have atypical \npresentations.27 In addition to chest pain or discomfort, women also have a lot \nof non chest related pain symptoms. Compared to men, women’s symptoms \nare more often precipitated by mental or emotional stress and less frequently \nby exertion.27\nThe prodromal symptoms of an MI may also be atypical e.g. shortness of \nbreath, sleep disturbances, diaphoresis, epigastric pain and fatigue.28,29 \nHowever, when presenting as an ACS, there are no gender differences where \nwomen may also have typical symptoms (acute chest pain associated with \nsweating).18,19\nWomen presenting with an MI tend to have more atherosclerotic plaque \nerosions than plaque rupture.30 In autopsy studies, plaque erosions accounted \nfor about 25% of MI.30 Most of these erosive lesions have a thick fibrous cap \nand do not have a necrotic core. In a series of patients who presented with MI \nand underwent aspiration thromboectomy followed by optical coherence \nstudies, the residual lesion showed relatively minor luminal narrowing.31 Most \nof these patients were younger individuals including premenopausal women \nand smokers.31\nFollowing an MI, women have worse outcomes irrespective of age.,11,32,33 \nMore women had sudden cardiac death (SCD) before their arrival in hospital \nand almost two thirds of women who died suddenly had no previous \nsymptoms.26,34",

At age of 55 years, with an optimal risk factor profile, lifetime risk \nfor CHD is 3.6% for men and < 1% in women; with ≥ 2 risk factors, it is 37.5% \nin men and 18.3% for women.39 In one study, women were found to \nexperience the combined end point of CV death, MI, stroke and HF \nhospitalization, an average of 5.7 years later than men of similar risk profiles. \nFor MI there was a delay of 10.7 years.23 \nThere are important gender-related differences in the prevalence and \noutcome of cardiac risk factors (section 4, pg 52). Generally, women with CHD \nare more likely to be obese and have type 2 diabetes when compared to \nmen.17,18,26 Elderly hypertensive women and young female smokers are \nespecially at risk for CHD. \nRisk assessment can be used to raise awareness of CVD, educate patients \nabout their CV risk, prompt lifestyle changes, guide therapy, and predict both \n10-year and lifetime risk of CVD.40 (section 5, pg 72)\n2.1.3. \nDiagnosis and Investigations\nWomen with chest pain are less likely to be referred for appropriate \ninvestigations due to the following:\n•    patient factors\n            - differences in presenting symptoms27-29\n            - cultural norms – passive nature, fearfulness, anxiety, denial, \n \nself-sacrifice and care giver roles\n            - co-morbidity e.g. arthritis, obesity\n            - age\n•     physician factors\n            - lack of awareness and misconceptions",

The sensitivity is 31-71% and specificity is about \n66 to 78% in women and about 80% for both in men.18,41,42 This is partly due \nto:\n• \nlower CHD prevalence in pre-menopausal women and thus a lower \n       pre-test probability of disease \n•      poor exercise tolerance resulting in failure to achieve an adequate level \n       of stress \n•     presence of baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities making \n       interpretation difficult\nDespite these limitations, a normal stress ECG at adequate workloads in \nwomen with intermediate probability of CHD is a good indication that there is \nno significant obstructive lesion.41,41 An exercise stress test, however, does not \ndetect myocardial ischemia in women with non- obstructive coronary lesions. \nDue to the limitations of exercise stress testing, stress echocardiography \n(exercise or dobutamine) and stress Single-Photon Emission Computed \nTomography (SPECT) have been recommended in women. Both these tests \ncan detect myocardial ischemia in the presence of obstructive and \nnon-obstructive coronary lesions.42 They also have higher specificity.43 The \ndiagnostic accuracy of SPECT however, can be reduced in women by both \nbreast tissue and obesity, resulting in false-positives, especially in the anterior \nmyocardial segments.\nCardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a newer imaging tool to investigate \nCHD in women. It has superior spatial resolution and does not use ionizing \nradiation unlike SPECT.44 The prognostic implications of stress CMR using \neither adenosine or dobutamine is being investigated in women. A negative \nstress CMR study is associated with very low risk of CV death and MI.45\n2.1.3.2.

Gender Specific issues\nThe benefits of treating hypertension has been shown in both gender although \nsome gender specific differences have been seen in the clinical trials. An \nearlier subgroup meta-analysis showed that in men, antihypertensive \ntreatment reduced all categories of events while in women it was statistically \nsignificant only for stroke and major CV events. In absolute terms, the benefit \nin women was seen primarily for strokes; in men, treatment prevented as \nmany coronary events as strokes.485-487\nHowever, a more recent large meta- analysis found that there were no gender \ndifferences on the primary outcome of total major cardiovascular events. \nThere was also no evidence that different anti-hypertensive regimens based \non ACEI, calcium antagonists, ARBs, or diuretics/β-blockers were more \neffective in one gender than the other.488\nCurrent guidelines for the treatment of hypertension are not gender specific. \nThere are however some gender differences. Diuretics were associated with \nbetter blood pressure control than any of the other drug classes as \nmonotherapy.489,490 Women are:\n• \nless likely than men to have BP controlled with lifestyle interventions \n \nalone488,489 \n• \nless successful in losing weight 489,490\n• \nmore sensitive and more likely to respond to salt restriction491,492\n• \nmore likely to develop hyponatraemia and/or hypokalaemia associated \n \nwith diuretic therapy493\n• \nless likely to respond to β-blockers490\n• \nmore likely to develop pedal oedema with calcium channel blockers490\n• \ntwice as likely as men to develop ACEI induced cough494\nSpecial issues in women:\n• \npre-conception counselling is important in young women with \n \nhypertension \n• \nwomen in the reproductive age should preferably avoid ACEI and ARBs\n• \nin pregnancy, the drugs of choice are methyldopa, nifedipine and \n \nlabetolol\n• \nweight loss and reduced sodium intake is beneficial in reducing blood \n \npressure in older women488",
