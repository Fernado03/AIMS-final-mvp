            "text": "Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon and potentially \nlethal infection affecting patients at risk. Despite advances in \nmedicine, IE still causes significant morbidity and mortality. \nThis is due to the changing epidemiology of the disease, the \nwide spectrum of presentation extending from the neonate to \nthe elderly, diagnostic difficulties, delayed surgical interventions \nand embolic complications. The advances in cardiothoracic \nsurgery and cardiology over the years with the increasing use \nof prosthetic material, valves and intracardiac devices have also contributed to the \nchallenges in managing IE in these patients.\nSome important evolution in management strategies would be the development \nof an Endocarditis Team with multidisciplinary expertise in cardiology, \ncardiothoracic surgery, infectious disease and other subspecialties as indicated. \nThis is encouraged to enable early diagnosis, optimise treatment and prevent \ncomplications in these patients. It also allows for smoother and more efficient \nreferrals to specialised centres.\nPreviously, surgical intervention was delayed because of the high-risk and mortality \nbut, recently published data have also shown that early surgical interventions in \nthese patients decrease embolic complications and improve outcomes.\nThere have also been changes with regards to antimicrobial prophylaxis. The \nevidence currently shows that routine antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to dental \nprocedures is not indicated for all cardiac patients and should be limited to high-\nrisk cardiac patients only. Maintaining a good oral and skin hygiene routine is highly \nrecommended in the prevention of IE.\nWith these recent developments in the prevention, diagnosis and management \nof IE, it is timely that we develop local clinical practice guidelines to update all \nrespective healthcare providers with regards to the new management strategies.\nI congratulate the committee for the effort and hope that these guidelines would \nserve to decrease the incidence of IE and its associated morbidity and mortality.\nDatuk Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector General of Health Malaysia\nFOREWORD BY THE \nDIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\n4",

A high level of clinical suspicion of IE is warranted \nespecially in those with pre-existing risk factors (refer Section 3.1.1).\n•\t Due to the varied spectrum of the disease, a combination of clinical \nassessment, microbiological testing and imaging are required to make the \ndiagnosis.\n•\t \tBlood culture is a key investigation in the diagnosis of IE. Proper technique of \nblood culture collection is crucial, as this will reduce the rate of contamination \nand yield a true positive result (refer Appendix 3).\n•\t Blood cultures should be drawn for patients with fever of unexplained origin \nand a heart murmur, a history of heart disease or previous endocarditis.\n•\t Three sets of blood cultures should be obtained first before administering \nantimicrobials when a patient has fever and predisposing risk factors for IE.\n•\t If blood cultures remain negative after 5 days of incubation and there \nis no history of prior antimicrobial use, consider blood culture negative \ninfective endocarditis (BCNIE), which can be caused by fungi or fastidious \nmicroorganisms, and perform the appropriate microbiological tests (refer Table \n3.2 and Figure 3a).",

Increase in the ageing population has also led to older patients with \nmultiple co-morbidities and no known structural heart disease being at risk of this \ndisease too. \nThe spectrum of microorganisms involved with IE have also changed of late, with \nthe increase in the presence of virulent and drug-resistant microorganisms such as \nStaphylococci and fungi that have contributed to the difficulties in the management \nof IE.\nIE still remains a therapeutic challenge with a high morbidity and mortality despite \nadvances in medicine and surgery. The changing trends in the epidemiology, the \nvaried clinical manifestations and complications, and diagnostic difficulties with the \nuncertainties of appropriate timing for surgical interventions, have contributed to the \npoor prognosis of this disease.\nThe aim of these clinical practice guidelines (CPG) is to enable medical personnel at \nall levels of care to diagnose IE early and effectively manage these patients.

Neurological \ncomplications can occur before or during the diagnosis of IE, but they can \nalso occur later in the clinical course of IE. Symptomatic neurological events \ndevelop in 25-40% of patients with IE.4,46,74 \nMost neurological complications occur early in the course of IE and they \nare most common in left-sided IE. The most common complications are \nischaemic and haemorrhagic complications. \nDiagnosis of neurological complications\nIt is important to make the diagnosis of neurological complications early, as \nwell as to assess the severity of the complication. Intracerebral events are \ndiagnosed by history-taking, clinical examination, and by imaging modalities. \nImaging modalities commonly used for the assessment of intracerebral \nevents include:\n•\t CT scan, with or without contrast agents (most commonly performed).\n•\t MRI, with or without gadolinium enhancement (better detection in \npatients with focal neurological lesions and may also detect lesions in \npatients without symptoms e.g. microbleeds). In addition to normal \nsequences, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI)/T2-\nweighted (T2W) gradient-echo (GRE) sequences are important to show \nasymptomatic infarcts or small microbleeds respectively. \n•\t Cerebral angiography is advisable when there is strong clinical suspicion \nof mycotic aneurysm despite negative findings on non-invasive imaging \nmodalities.\nImaging investigations should be done as soon as clinical features appear, \npreferably within 24 hours. The presence of neurological complications, its \ntype and severity is important as it will impact the optimal management of IE. \nIt is of particular importance to be specific when describing and grading \nthe neurological complications of IE (refer Table 4.1).\n4.0 MANAGEMENT",

Therefore, it is crucial to anticipate the potential risk in patients \nwith predisposing factors for embolisation (refer Section 4.1.2.3), make a \nrapid diagnosis and initiate appropriate antimicrobials as soon as possible to \nprevent a first or recurrent neurological event.80\nC.\tManagement of mycotic aneurysms\nAn aneurysm is a focal arterial dilatation involving all three layers of the \narterial wall. Anuerysmal degeneration secondary to bacteraemia or septic \nembolisation is called a mycotic aneurysm. They are thin walled, friable \nand rupture easily resulting in intracranial haemorrhage. Cerebral mycotic \naneurysms are a rare and deadly type of aneurysm that have no definitive \ntreatment guidelines and represent 0.7-5.4% of all cerebral aneurysms. The \nmortality rate after rupture could reach as high as 80%.82 The diagnosis of \nmycotic aneurysm is made by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or \ncerebral angiography. \nThe evolution of mycotic aneurysms is unpredictable even after antimicrobial \ntherapy and variable outcomes have been reported.83 Predictive factors for \naneurysmal rupture have not been ascertained up to date. \nThe treatment of mycotic aneurysms should be tailored according to \nresponse to antimicrobial therapy, location of aneurysm and clinical \nstatus of the patient. They can be treated surgically, endovascularly or \nby watchful waiting. Cerebral mycotic aneurysms should be treated \nby a multidisciplinary team in a tertiary centre. This team consists of \ncardiologists, neurosurgeons, interventional neuroradiologists, neurologists \nand intensivists. In addition, this centre must have facilities and expertise to \nmanage cerebral mycotic aneurysm patients. There are many factors which \ndetermine the choice of management, either open surgery or endovascular \nmanagement. However, the most important are the following:82\n•\t The morphology and location of the aneurysm.\n•\t Whether it is possible to sacrifice the parent artery.\n•\t Whether the patient needs or has received valve replacement surgery.\n•\t The patient’s overall status.\nDecisions by the multidisciplinary team should be followed after discussion \nwith the patient and family members.",

Although infrequent, one important complication of TAVI is IE. IE \nfor TAVI is classified according to the modified Duke criteria.186 Patients with high \nclinical suspicion of TAVI related PVE should be referred to specialist centres \n(refer Section 4.1.4). In patients who have had TAVI and who develop prolonged \nfever, valve murmur or new valvular regurgitation, a TTE should be performed. \nSince images may be suboptimal due to acoustic shadows, a TEE should also be \nconsidered in order to obtain clearer views of the prosthetic valve.\nIn the major PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial, PVE \noccurred at a similar rate in the surgical and transcatheter groups (1.5% and 1.0% \nrespectively, p = 0.61).187 Two varieties of valves; the Edwards SAPIEN (Edwards \nLifesciences Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) and Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic Inc., \nMinneapolis, MN, USA) have had reported cases of PVE.188\nIn IE with TAVI, patients have had positive blood cultures with a microbiological \nprofile typical to that previously documented in surgical bioprosthetic PVE; \nEnterococcus spp.,CoNS, S. aureus and Streptococcus spp.188 The incidence \nof PVE may also be increased by patient risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, \noral hygiene and adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis for dental procedures.188\nAntimicrobial prophylaxis for TAVI patients is recommended as in Chapter 8.0. \nFor TAVI related PVE, the first line of treatment is targeted antimicrobial therapy. \nWhile conventional indications for operative intervention in the setting of PVE may be \nless applicable to high-risk TAVI cohorts, surgical treatment remains an option to be \ndiscussed in the context of complications related to IE.188\n7.0 SPECIFIC SITUATIONS\nManagement of patients with TAVI IE:\n1.\t Patients with high clinical suspicion TAVI related PVE should be referred \nto SC.

Patients who develop fever or blood \nstream infection with no obvious source, should be referred back to the primary \ncentre responsible for the implantation. Patients should be educated regarding \nthese risks.\nEchocardiography and blood cultures (refer Sections 3.2 & 3.3) are the mainstay \nfor the diagnosis of CIED IE. TTE may identify lead vegetation and tricuspid valve \ninvolvement. However, a negative TTE does not rule out CIED IE, hence it is \nrecommended to proceed to a TEE examination. TEE is more sensitive and specific \nto TTE for diagnosis of lead-related endocarditis.\nConsidering their complementary role, it is preferable to perform both investigations \nin cases of suspected CIED IE, as a TTE at time of diagnosis may be used as baseline \nfor additional studies during the course of the illness. In cases where the clinical \nsuspicion is still high but cardiac imaging with TTE and TEE yields no evidence of \nendocarditis (false negative) other imaging modality such as radiolabelled leucocyte \nscintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning may prove useful.194-196 Repeated TEE \nis not necessary after completion of treatment.",

In the \nensuing years, whilst there was a very significant fall in antimicrobial prophylaxis \nprescribing, there was also a significant increase in the incidence of IE. In 2016, NICE \nreviewed the evidence and concluded that there was no requirement to change \nthe existing CG64 guidance and emphasised that antimicrobial prophylaxis against \nIE is not recommended routinely for people undergoing dental, gastrointestinal \ntract, genitourinary and respiratory tract procedures. Additionally, these guidelines \nemphasised prevention rather than prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of IE.\nIt is however, the consensus view of this writing committee that antimicrobial \nprophylaxis is administered to all patients at high-risk for IE including those with \nestablished rheumatic heart disease who are undergoing invasive dental and \nsurgical procedures.\n8.2  Cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of infective \nendocarditis\nPatients with cardiac conditions listed in Table 8.1 are considered as being at \nincreased risk of developing IE and are indicated for antimicrobial prophylaxis.",

It is independent of drug clearance. \nTherefore, provided the desired drug concentration and volume of distribution are \nunchanged, the size of the loading dose does not require modification in patients \nwith renal impairment. In cases where there is slight alteration in the volume of \ndistribution, e.g. those with low serum protein or fluid overload, some clinicians may \nalter the loading dose of some drugs with narrow therapeutic index.1\nMethods of dose reduction in renal impairment\nThree common methods are used to maintain drug doses in patients with renal \nimpairment:1\n•\t Interval method (I):\nMaintain the size of the individual dose and increase the dose interval – used \nwhere the size of the dose and the attainment of peak blood concentrations are \ncritical for drug efficacy.\n•\t Dose method (D):\nReduce the size of individual dose and maintain the same dose interval – used \nwhere the size of a dose and peak concentrations are not critical for drug activity.\n•\t Combination method (D & I):\nUses a combination of the ‘Dose’ and ‘Interval’ methods – used for narrow \ntherapeutic index drugs where close control over blood concentrations should \nbe maintained.\nEstimating creatinine clearance in adults\nCheck renal function before prescribing any drug that requires dose modification in \nrenal impairment, even if only mild impairment is likely. \nRenal function and muscle mass both decline with age, hence elderly people \nmay have normal serum creatinine despite reduced renal function. Calculation \nof creatinine clearance (CrCl) may be necessary to estimate renal function in \nthis population especially when prescribing renally excreted drugs with a narrow \ntherapeutic index.\n10.0 APPENDICES",
