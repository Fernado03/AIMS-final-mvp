It is based on the best \navailable evidence at the time of the CPG development. Adherence to the \nguidelines may not necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every \nhealthcare provider is responsible for the management of his/her unique patient \nbased on the clinical picture presented by the patients and the management \noptions available.\nEvery care has been taken to ensure that the information in this publication is \ncorrect at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, \ncorrections will be published in the web version of this document, which will serve \nas the definitive version at all times. \nNEXT UPDATE\nThe year of issue of this current CPG is 2023. It will be reviewed in 4 years (2027) \nor sooner if new evidence becomes available. The Chairman of the CPG or the \nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be consulted to determine if there is a \nneed for a revision, and if so, the extent of the revision needed. A multidisciplinary \nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used by \nMalaysian Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed for \nthe next update.\n01\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)",

The inclusion \ncriteria were all children, adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. \nThe search was limited to literature published in the last 15 years, involving only \nhuman studies and in the English language. All searches were conducted from \nApril 2019 to January 2022. In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles \nwere searched to identify further studies. Reference was also made to the latest \nedition of other guidelines on the management of obesity including international \nguidelines. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the \nCPG Secretariat.\nSome of the international guidelines that were used as reference were:\n•\t The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist and American College of \nEndocrinology Comprehensive Clinical Practice Guidelines for Medical Care of \nPatients with Obesity\n•\t AHA/ACC/TOS Guideline for the Management of Overweight and Obesity \nin Adults: a Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart \nAssociation Task Force on Practice Guidelines and The Obesity Society\n•\t The American Diabetes Association’s Position Statement on Physical Activity/\nExercise and Diabetes\n•\t The American College of Sports Medicine Position Stand on the Appropriate \nPhysical Activity Intervention Strategies for Weight Loss and Prevention of \nWeight Regain for Adults\n•\t The American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s Recommendations for the Amount \nof Sleep for the Paediatric Population\n•\t The National Health and Medical Research Council (Melbourne) Clinical \nPractice Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, \nAdolescents and Children Australia\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)",

Members of the committee were assigned to a section of the CPG and tasked \nto develop the contents based on the relevant clinical questions (refer to Clinical \nQuestions below). The committee met 12 times throughout the development of \nthe guidelines – the first 4 meetings were held face-to-face while the subsequent 7 \nwere held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the final (12th) meeting was held \nface-to-face, when movement restriction was lifted. All the retrieved articles were \ncritically appraised by at least 2 committee members using the Critical Appraisal \nSkill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and discussed during the \nmeetings. The statements and recommendations within these guidelines were \nformulated after they were commented on by both the committee and RC. Where \nthe evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were derived by consensus \nof the committee and RC. Any differences in opinion were resolved consensually. \nThe CPG was based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses \nand clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThis CPG uses the SIGN50 criteria for Grades of Recommendation and Levels of \nEvidence (see Grade of Recommendation and Level of Evidence section below). \nOn completion, the CPG draft was reviewed by external reviewers. It was also \nposted on the MoH, Malaysia official website for feedback from any interested \nparties. The feedback and comments were reviewed and the draft corrected \nbased on the decision of the committee and RC. The final draft was presented \nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG and the Health Technology \nAssessment (HTA) and CPG Council MoH Malaysia for approval. Details of the CPG \ndevelopment by MaHTAS can be obtained from the Manual on Development and \nImplementation of Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 \nat: https://www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/CPG_MANUAL_MAHTAS.pdf?mid=634.\nThe guidelines objectives\nThe objectives of this CPG are to provide evidence-based recommendations on \nthe management of obesity in Malaysia.\nTerms of reference",

While socio-economic development has improved the overall \nquality of life, it has also led to lifestyle changes that are not always conducive \nto good health, including unhealthy diets and sedentary habits. Although the \ncauses of obesity are complex and multifactorial, unhealthy lifestyle choices \nremain a significant risk factor.\nTo effectively manage obesity, it is crucial to involve various healthcare \nprofessionals, such as public health nutritionists and policymakers, to achieve \noptimal results. Patients also play a critical role, and a holistic approach that \nincludes health education and lifestyle changes is essential for success. Recent \nevidence shows that multiple approaches can be effective in managing obesity, \nincluding various types of calorie restriction, exercise, pharmacotherapy, and \nbariatric surgery. The Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of \nObesity (2nd Edition) comprehensively reflect these approaches and have been \neagerly awaited.\nThis CPG is a valuable resource for healthcare professionals at all levels, from \nprimary to tertiary care, to deliver the best possible care for their patients. The \nguidelines also focus on preventing overweight and obesity in all age groups, \nespecially in children and adolescents. I would like to extend my congratulations \nto the members of the development committee for their hard work, and I hope \nthat this document will further elevate the standard of care for managing people \nwith obesity.\nDatuk Dr Muhammad Radzi bin Abu Hassan\nDirector General of Health, Malaysia",

These guidelines are \nmotivated by the recognition that the prevalence of overweight and obesity \nin Malaysia is increasing, and healthcare practitioners need to be alert to the \nassociated health risks. Based on the National Health and Morbidity Survey \n2019, one in two Malaysians is overweight or obese. The excess weight is \noften accompanied by hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, \nmetabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and other health issues.\nThe 1st edition of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Obesity \nwas developed almost two decades ago, and it is timely to have the guidelines \nrevised. There have been many breakthroughs and advances in the management \nof obesity; through nutrition, different types of exercise, pharmacotherapy, and \nbariatric surgery.\nThese guidelines used the principles of evidence-based medicine, and scientific \nevidence was examined thoroughly by the committee, by meticulously expoloring \nvarious treatment strategies and their effects on weight loss. Cognitive behaviour, \nwhich helps people with obesity sustain lifestyle changes and improve their \nquality of life, is emphasised in these guidelines. In addition, recognising that \noverweight and obesity among children and adolescents in Malaysia is on the rise, \na dedicated chapter has been developed to comprehensively address evaluating \nand managing this population.\nWe hope these clinical guidelines will help healthcare practitioners understand \nthe importance of weight management and be able to assess and manage their \npatients effectively. It is equally important for people with obesity to obtain the \noptimum standard of care that they deserved.\nI would like to thank all members of the commitee for their tireless efforts in \nproducing the 2nd edition of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management \nof Obesity.\nProfessor Dr Norlaila Mustafa\nSenior Consultant Physician and Endocrinologist",

Obesity: the disease\n1.1\t Introduction\nObesity is a complex and chronic disease that has a heterogenous presentation. \nThe excess and unwanted body fat accumulation or adiposity lead to many \ncomplications and increased risk of premature morbidity and mortality. Studies \nhave shown that overweight and obesity increased the risk of chronic health \nconditions and reduced quality of life.1,2 [Level 1++] Hence, like any other chronic \ndisease, early recognition, appropriate and effective individualised intervention \nand long-term support are essential.\nNot only are overweight and obesity associated with chronic diseases like type \n2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, \nosteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), it also increases the risk of \nseveral types of cancers.3 [Level 1+]\nApart from the impact that overweight and obesity have in reducing the quality \nof life and well-being, the physical, psychosocial functioning and perceptions of \nhealth of persons with obesity are greatly affected by the disease.4 [Level 1++] \nPersons with obesity experience stigma and discrimination at the workplace and \nat healthcare facilities. In addition to the morbidity and mortality associated with \nobesity, there are significant healthcare expenditures resulting from obesity \nassociated medical conditions.\nThe total cost of obesity related healthcare spending in Malaysia is the highest \n(19.36%), compared to other ASEAN countries (<10%). The estimated productive \nyears lost for males and females associated with obesity in Malaysia is 6-11 years \nand 7-12 years respectively, and this has a negative impact to the overall economic \nstatus of the country.5\n1.2\t Epidemiology\nThe increasing global prevalence of obesity is alarming. Malaysia is no exception. \nThe National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2019 with a significant number of \nrespondents (n=16,688) determined the prevalence of overweight and obesity \nwere 32.3% and 33.7%, respectively (body mass index; BMI based on Asian cut-off \nscales).\nGenerally, the prevalence of obesity increases with age.6 [Level 3] Although the \nprevalence of physically inactive adults was only 25.1% (NHMS 2015), the choice \nof unhealthy foods seems to be the contributing factor for obesity. Apart from \nthe NHMS data, smaller studies in targeted populations have also demonstrated",

The prevalence of overweight and obesity \nin 2,221 adolescents between the age of 12 to 18 years were 17.0% and 14.9%, \nrespectively.7 A prospective nationwide study, The Malaysian Cohort (TMC), \ninvolving more than 100,000 multi ethnic respondents from both urban and rural \nsettings reported a baseline prevalence of obesity at approximately 17.7%.8\n1.3\t Obesity as a disease\nObesity is a disease because it meets the definition — it decreases the life \nexpectancy and impairs the normal functioning of the body, has characteristic \nsigns and symptoms, increases morbidity and can be caused by genetic factors. \nObesity is a health threat that is associated with an increased risk of other chronic \ndiseases including T2DM, fatty liver, cardiovascular disease, OSA, stroke, dementia \nand cancer.9\nThe overproduction of leptin secondary to excess adipose tissue and increased \nfood intake lead to abnormal energy expenditure. Additionally, obesity \ncontributes to mechanical problems within the body, namely pain of the hip \nand knee joints. Obesity is also linked to reproductive problems in both men \nand women and is associated with infertility and the risk of miscarriage. Obesity \nhas led to an increased risk of preventable early death, i.e., 29.5% for men and \n14.6% for women compared to those with a normal BMI (19% for men and 11% for \nwomen).10 [Level 1++]\n1.4\t Impact of weight loss on associated medical conditions\nFor persons who have weight related medical conditions, reducing weight benefits \ntheir health and reduces the risk of additional problems related to obesity-related \ncomplications. \nA modest weight loss of 5% to 10% is associated with improvement in blood \npressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.11 [Level 1++] This is \neven more significant in those with a higher BMI where moderate weight loss is \nassociated with improvement in glucose, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein \n(LDL) cholesterol levels.12 [Level 1++] Weight loss of between 10% to 15% is needed \nto improve other clinical conditions such as OSA, osteoarthritis and steatotic \nhepatitis. Real-world data on the benefits of weight loss revealed the greatest \nbenefit for the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors that can be translated into \nreduction of morbidity and mortality.13 [Level 3]\nThese clinical practice guidelines intend to provide healthcare providers \ncomprehensive evidence-based guidance for screening and managing overweight \nand obesity, i.e., how to evaluate, treat, and manage a person with obesity while \nincorporating individual needs and preferences for improved clinical outcomes.\n1.

Assessment and diagnosis \n2.1 \tScreening \nAll adults should be screened annually using body mass index (BMI) measurement; \na cut-off point of ≥23 kg/m2 should be used to initiate further evaluation of \noverweight or obesity.14 [Level 2+]\nHowever, measurement of body fat can be used as an alternative to BMI for \nscreening for obesity. Truncal obesity can be an indicator of obesity-associated \nconditions, especially in those with lower BMI.\n2.2\tDiagnosis \nThe BMI is an international standard for measurement of obesity as recommended \nby the World Health Organization (WHO), however, it was based on Europids \nand did not accurately reflect other ethnic groups,15 e.g. in the Asian population, \nwhere morbidity and mortality occur at lower BMI and waist circumference.16,17\nThe BMI is still the most widely accepted measurement of obesity as it is easy to \naccess, affordable to measure, and can conveniently be used to monitor weight \nchanges.\nAsians generally have higher body fat percentages compared to Caucasians at \nsimilar BMI cut-off points.18 [Level 1++]19 [Level 2] Evidence from Asian countries \nreveal that the risk of comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), \nhypertension and other cardiovascular (CV) risks, begin to increase at lower \nBMI.20-23 [Level 1+]24 [Level 2+] Hence, the lower BMI cut-off points for overweight \nand obesity for the Asian population (Table 2-1).\nClassification of weight by BMI\nThe initial assessment of people with obesity should include height, weight and \nBMI (kg/m2). The classification of weight by BMI for the Asian population and its \nassociated CV risk are shown in Table 2-1.\nBody mass index (BMI) = Weight (kg) / height2 (m2)",

Hence, the assessment of visceral adiposity which is a predictor for \nthe development of T2DM, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and CV mortality \nrisk, is a better parameter than total body fat alone.29 [Level 3]\nClassification by waist circumference\nAbdominal or visceral fat is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease \n(CVD).30 Waist circumference (WC) is measured in the horizontal plane, midway \nbetween the lowest ribs and the iliac crest (see Figure 2-A). Its measurement \ncorrelates well with abdominal fat content irrespective of the BMI.31 [Level 2+]\nWC is a very practical measurement for assessing excess fat around the abdomen. \nThere are other ways to measure body fat but most of these methods are not \nreadily available or convenient in clinical settings.

Psychological and \nbehavioural therapy\n3.1\t Psychological aspect of obesity\nPersons with overweight and obesity struggle with various mental health issues \nsuch as weight bias, stigma and discrimination. These are generally negative \nattitudes, beliefs and behaviours towards individuals who are obese and include \nprejudice and stereotype labelling such as being lazy, unmotivated, lacking willpower \nand discipline.\nStigmatising being overweight and obese is not helpful as it is associated with \nreduced motivation to engage in healthy behaviours leading to avoidance of \nexercise and non-adherence to diet and medication. It also has mental health \nconsequences such as body image dissatisfaction, reduced quality of life, low self-\nesteem and poor overall wellbeing.36,37 [Level 1+]38 [Level 1-] In addition to poor \nhealth outcomes, weight discrimination may shorten life expectancy.39 [Level 2+]\nA recent systematic review found that obesity is associated with depressive \ndisorders, anxiety disorders (Odds ratio [OR] 1.27-1.40), personality disorders (OR \n1.2-1.95), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (OR 1.44) and eating disorders \n(OR 4.5). There is a bidirectional relationship between obesity and depression \nwhere people with obesity have a higher risk of developing depression (OR 1.21-\n5.8) while people with depression have a higher risk of becoming obese (OR 1.18-\n3.76), with a stronger association observed in women.40 [Level 1-]\nHealthcare providers should identify if patients with obesity or overweight \nhave pre-existing mental health issues. These patients should be referred to a \npsychiatrist for diagnosis and to optimise their mental health status. They should \nalso ensure that the psychological and behavioural interventions to treat obesity \nare done appropriately and effectively (refer to the relevant clinical practice \nguidelines for screening of specific mental disorders). Individuals with binge \neating disorder can be identified by using the Binge Eating Scale tool (refer \nAppendix 2).\n3.2\tPsychological and behavioural interventions for obesity \nand weight management\nPsychological and behavioural interventions for overweight and obesity aim to \nhelp people with obesity to sustain lifestyle changes that improve self-esteem, \nhealth, functioning and quality of life.41 [Level 1++] The majority of these \ninterventions are cognitive-based and are typically used in combination with \nlifestyle interventions.42 [Level 1++] When behaviour therapy is combined with \ndiet and exercise, it resulted in a greater weight reduction compared to diet or",

Management of obesity \nin adults\n4.1\t Comprehensive lifestyle modification \nComprehensive lifestyle modification when managing persons with overweight \nand obesity includes modifying eating (dietary) and activity habits. Hence, the \ngoal of lifestyle interventions for obesity treatment is to achieve weight loss \nthrough a decrease in calories consumed and an increase in energy expended.47 \n[Level 4] \nA 6-month structured lifestyle intervention that included dietary counselling and \na physical activity programme among overweight and obese women in a low \nsocioeconomic community setting, produced a small percentage of weight loss \nand decreased visceral fat compared to the control group. There was, however, \na significant increase in skeletal muscle mass (0.13 kg) in the intervention group \ncompared to the control group (-0.37 kg), p=0.033 throughout the study period. \nUnfortunately, this was not sustained during the maintenance period.48 [Level 2-]\nIn a workplace setting, a 4-month lifestyle intervention that incorporated diet \nchanges, physical activity and behaviour modification education delivered through \nface-to-face, online (web-based) or printed education material (control group), \nthe face-to-face group showed the greatest body weight reduction (-5.80 kg) \ncompared to the online and the control groups (-1.12 kg and -1.82 kg, respectively). \nThe face-to-face group also had the highest reductions in waist circumference \n(WC) and energy intake and improvement in lipid profile.49 [Level 2-]\n4.1.1\t Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for adults \nTreating obesity requires achieving a state of negative energy balance. Hence, \ndietary intervention for obesity should primarily address the reduction in energy \n(calorie) intake. There are many dietary approaches that reduce calorie intake, \nsome more than others, and the degree of weight loss generally reflects the size of \nthis reduction.47 [Level 4] The goals of MNT are to facilitate weight loss, prevent \nweight gain, improve cardiometabolic outcomes and optimise nutrient adequacy.\nWeight management interventions by a dietitian\nMNT for weight management reduced body mass index (BMI) (-1.5 kg/m2, 95% \nCI -1.74,-1.26 kg/m2), improved percentage weight loss (-4.01%, 95% CI -5.26, \n-2.75%), WC reduction (-3.45 cm, 95% CI -4.39, -2.51 cm), systolic blood pressure \n(BP) reduction (-3.04 mmHg, 95% CI -5.10, -0.98 mmHg), diastolic BP reduction \n(-1.99 mmHg, 95% CI -3.02, -0.96 mmHg) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) \nreduction among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; -12.47 mg/dL, \n95% CI -17.50, -7.44 mg/dL).50 [Level 1++]",

Management of obesity in adults\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\nIn Malaysia, the anti-obesity drugs available for managing obesity are orlistat, \nphentermine, high dose liraglutide and semaglutide. Phentermine, while not \nUSFDA-approved for the long-term management of obesity, is registered for use \nin Malaysia as an anti-obesity drug. However, it should be used only for a duration \nof 3 months and in a cyclical manner.\nWhen selecting an anti-obesity drug, the decision should be made based on its \nefficacy, side-effects and cost.\nTypes of anti-obesity drugs\nAnti-obesity drugs can be classified into two groups, i.e., those acting on the \ngastrointestinal (GI) system to reduce fat absorption and those acting on the \ncentral nervous system (CNS) and have been summarised in Table 4-5.\nDrugs acting on the GI system\n1. Oral orlistat\nOrlistat is the only non-systemically acting drug available for the long-term \ntreatment of obesity. It is a selective pancreatic lipase inhibitor – inhibiting the \nbreakdown of dietary triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids. As a result, \n~30% of ingested triglycerides are excreted, mainly in the stools, leading to a \ncaloric deficit.85\nEfficacy of orlistat compared to placebo in weight reduction:79 [Level 1++]\n•\t Odds Ratio (OR) 2.69 for 5% weight loss\n•\t OR 2.41 for 10% weight loss\n•\t Mean weight loss in excess of placebo was 2.6 kg\nAt 3-4 years of treatment, Orlistat together with lifestyle intervention or VLCD \nsignificantly reduced weight and maintained weight loss with minimal side \neffects.86,87 [Level 1+]\nOrlistat also causes reduction in BP and glucose levels88 [Level 1++] and, \nimprovement in the lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides and \nHDL-C).89 [Level 1+]\nSide effects of orlistat include:90,91\n•\t Abdominal discomfort such as borbygmi and cramps\n•\t Liquid or oily stool\n•\t Faecal incontinence and oily spotting\n•\t Flatulence with discharge\n•\t Reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E and K)",

This would facilitate early referral for evaluation of at-\nrisk children.\n6.2.2\tLifestyle interventions\nLifestyle interventions remain the first-line approach for the prevention of \nchildhood obesity. However, the combination of interventions is largely varied \ndue to the complexity of childhood obesity itself. As a child’s behaviour is very \nmuch dependant on their environment, preventive measures must target the \nfamily and school environment.\nFamily environment\nThere is evidence for an association between the development of paediatric obesity \nand family dysfunction, as well as, exposure to stress.194 This requires programmes \nto foster healthy family functioning and to minimise paediatric stress.\nIn addition, research indicates the need for parental involvement and a whole \nfamily approach for successful prevention programmes.151 Any preventive \nprogramme will, therefore, need to involved the whole family to advocate good \nparenting practices and lifestyle choices. There should be support for home \nactivities that encourage children to be more active, eat nutritious foods and \nspend less time on screen-based activities.\n6.

The use \nof multicomponent interventions focusing on dietary, physical activity and \nbehavioural aspects may be useful depending on the age-group, settings and \navailable resources. Also, the implementation of multidisciplinary childhood \nobesity intervention programmes in the clinical setting should involve a team of \ncare providers including a psychologist, trained nurse, dietitian, physiotherapist \nand exercise specialist.196 [Level 1-]\nLifestyle intervention would have to be comprehensive involving the whole \nfamily and the environment the child lives in. Main findings from literature \nindicate using school-based preventive programmes with family and community \nreinforcement.195 Research has indicated the need for parental involvement and a \nwhole family approach in the success of prevention programmes.151,197\nIn children ≤6 years old\nData from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 520 children focused \nsolely on dietary intervention suggested little to no difference in BMI Z-score \nreductions in children ≤5 years old.198 [Level 1-]\n6.
