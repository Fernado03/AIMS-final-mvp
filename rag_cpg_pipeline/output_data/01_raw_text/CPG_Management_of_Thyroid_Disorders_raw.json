On occasion, long-term, low-dose treatment with MMI may be \nappropriate. \n•\t\nA differential WBC count should be obtained during febrile illness and at the \nonset of pharyngitis in all patients taking antithyroid medication. \n•\t\nLiver function and hepatocellular integrity should be assessed in patients taking \nMMI or PTU who experience pruritic rash, jaundice, light-coloured stool or dark \nurine, joint pain, abdominal pain or bloating, anorexia, nausea, or fatigue. \nHYPOTHYROIDISM\n•\t\nLevothyroxine is the recommended preparation of choice and the mainstay of \ntreatment of hypothyroidism. \nThe three main aims of therapy are: \n\t\ni) \t\n\u0007To provide resolution of signs and symptoms, including biological and \nphysiological markers of hypothyroidism \n\t\nii) \t \u0007To achieve normalisation of serum TSH with improvement in thyroid \nhormone concentrations \n\t\niii)\t \u0007To avoid iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis or overtreatment particularly in the \nelderly \n•\t\nLevothyroxine is best taken on empty stomach (1 hour before breakfast or at \nbedtime, at least 3 hours after the last meal of the day) because absorption \nis impaired if taken with food.

The recommended target range \nfor TSH is in the lower half of the reference range while for free T4 is in the upper \nhalf of the reference range. Levothyroxine is effective in reducing the thyroid \ngland size/goitre.\n• \t Non-goitrous euthyroid Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: One should monitor for goitre, \nantithyroid antibodies and pattern of thyroid function; treatment with thyroxine \nis controversial.\n• \t Hyperthyroidism: The first-line initial treatment is ATD, which is carbimazole \nor its active metabolite MMI. Methimazole/carbimazole dose typically used is \n0.2–0.5 mg/kg daily, with a range from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily (maximal \ninitial dose: 30 mg daily). After 2–4 weeks, when the thyroid hormone levels have \nnormalised, the initial dose should gradually be reduced by 30%–50%. TSH levels \nmay take 2–4 months to appear in the serum and should not be used to titrate \nthe dose. If children develop serious adverse reactions to MMI, RAI or surgery \nshould be considered, because the risks of PTU are considered greater than the \nrisks of RAI or surgery.\n•\t\nHyperthyroidism: Propylthiouracil (PTU) should not be used in children. If it is \nused, it should be stopped immediately and liver function should be assessed in \nchildren who develop anorexia, pruritus, rash, jaundice, light coloured stool or \ndark urine, joint pain, right upper quadrant pain or abdominal bloating, nausea \nor malaise due to the risk of idiosyncratic liver failure.\n•\t\nHyperthyroidism: Definitive therapy available for GD is RAI or thyroidectomy. \nIndications for definitive treatment in children include relapse after an \nappropriate duration of ATD, a lack of compliance on the part of the patient/\ncaretakers or adverse effects of ATD.

On the other hand, the prevalence of \nhypothyroidism is 2.1% (0.5% overt and 1.6% subclinical hypothyroidism). Except \nfor overt hyperthyroidism, the majority of subjects with thyroid dysfunction were \nnewly diagnosed. The proportion of those who were newly diagnosed with thyroid \ndysfunction was as high as 68%. Females were found to have a higher prevalence \nof thyroid dysfunction compared to their male counterparts (female: 4.1% vs. male: \n1.9% for hyperthyroidism and 2.6% vs. 1.2% for hypothyroidism).1 (Level III) \nThe same study looked at the prevalence of goitre and thyroid nodule. The \nprevalence of goitre and thyroid nodule in the Malaysian population is 9.3% and \n3.6%, respectively. Despite having an abnormality at the anterior neck, as high as \n62% of those with grade 2 goitre and 68% of those with thyroid nodule were newly \ndiagnosed. In the Malaysian population, there was a higher prevalence of goitre in \nthe Indian population and those aged less than 45 years. There was also a higher \nprevalence of goitre with positive thyroid antibodies in coastal and urban areas, \nindicating increased iodine exposure. On the other hand, there may also be pockets \nof iodine-deficient areas in rural regions, where a high prevalence of goitre was not \nassociated with positive thyroid antibodies.2 (Level III) \nThe prevalence of thyroid antibodies in the Malaysian population was 12.2% for \nanti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and 12.1% for anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG). \nFemales have a higher prevalence of positive thyroid antibodies compared to \nmales (female: 15.2% vs. male: 3.0% for anti-TPO and 15.7% vs. 6.0% for anti-TG). \nSurprisingly, those with Indian ethnicity had a significantly higher prevalence of anti-\nTPO compared from other ethnic groups. Coastal and urban regions reported a \nhigher prevalence of thyroid antibodies (as high as 16.1% for anti-TPO and 17.8% for \nanti-TG), supporting the possibility of higher iodine exposure in these areas.3 (Level III)\n2. HYPERTHYROIDISM\n2.1 OVERT HYPERTHYROIDISM\n2.1.1 Causes Of Thyrotoxicosis\nThyrotoxicosis occurs due to inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues \nsecondary to elevated thyroid hormone levels, as opposed to hyperthyroidism, \nwhich is a subset of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high thyroid hormone \nsynthesis and secretion by the thyroid gland.4 (Level I)",

Yersinia \nenterocolitica infection has been associated with Graves’ disease.7 (Level II) Other causes \nof primary hyperthyroidism include toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goitre. \nGenetic analysis of resected nodules revealed a mutation in the TSH receptor gene, \nwhich leads to basal activation of the protein kinase A pathway and increased \nT4 production and increased cellular proliferation. In addition, the mutation \nleads to increased TSH receptor affinity to TSH, thus increasing thyroid hormone \nsynthesis.8  (Level II) Not all of these hot nodules are actually benign. Some may be \nmalignant, and further workout is necessary. The risk of malignancy in hot nodules \nmay be underestimated, and a literature review reported that a weighted rate of \n3.1% (0–12.5%) of hot nodules are graded as thyroid cancer.9(Level I) Thyroid papillary \ncarcinoma can cause hyperthyroidism.10 (Level III) Graves’ disease can co-exist with toxic \nadenoma and is termed as Marine–Lenhart syndrome.11 (Level III) And, finally, there is \na small group of patients with diffuse non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism due to a \ngenetic mutation leading to the production of thyroid hormone without any TSH \nligand.12 (Level III)\nB. \u0007Thyroid Stores Of Preformed Hormone Are Passively Released In Excessive \nAmounts Due To Autoimmune, Infective, Chemical, Or Physical Insults\nDestruction of the thyroid follicle cells can result in the hyperthyroid stage of any \nthyroiditis. It could be due to autoimmune processes such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis; \ninfective like subacute thyroiditis (viral) or even Mycobacterium tuberculosis,13,14 (Level \nIII) cellulitis of the skin anterior to the neck or due to physical insult from a rapidly \ngrowing anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid gland or primary thyroid lymphoma.15, \n16 (Level III)\nC. \u0007Exposure To Extrathyroidal Sources Of Thyroid Hormone Either \nEndogenous Or Exogenous\nEndogenous sources of thyroid hormones include struma ovarii, which is actually \nteratoma of the ovaries composed mainly of thyroid tissue17 (Level III) and metastatic \nthyroid carcinoma secreting thyroid hormones. These are actually rare, with \nfewer than 100 cases reported since 1946.18 (Level III) Exogenous sources of thyroid \nhormones are becoming commoner nowadays. Over-the–counter supplements \ncontaining thyroid support/thyroid supplements/thyroid health actually contain \nvarious amounts of T3 and/or T4 that are readily available over the Internet – via \nonline purchases.19, 20 (Level III,II) They are cheap, there is no need for a prescription, \nand people have more privacy in managing their own health.

These supplements may not mention the actual ingredients \nused.20,21 (Level II,III) In addition, exogenous sources of thyroid hormones can come from \ncooked animals’ thyroid gland, as reported in an epidemic of thyrotoxicosis after \ningesting thyroid hormone-containing beef hamburger.22 (Level III)\nD. \u0007The Thyroid Gland Is Excessively Stimulated By Trophic Factors Such As \nThyrotropin-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) And Other Factors. \nTSHoma, which is pituitary gland thyrotrophs adenoma secreting excessive \namounts of TSH leading to secondary hyperthyroidism is rare. Besides, gestational \ntrophoblastic disease, which secretes b-HCG (which has partial molecular similarity \nwith TSH) can lead to thyrotoxicosis. It is also rare, as only 2.0 per 1000 pregnancies \nhave gestational trophoblastic disease, of which only 7% have biochemical \nthyrotoxicosis.23 (Level III) Iodinated contrast materials are increasingly being used \nduring CT scans and angiographic procedures. Amiodarones are used frequently \nfor various types of tachyarrhythmia. The iodine content in radiographic contrast \nmaterials and amiodarone is much higher than the amount human beings actually \nrequire. This excess iodine will lead to Jod–Basedow thyrotoxicosis.24, 25 (Level III) \nThe prevalence of contrast iodine-induced subclinical hyperthyroidism can reach \nup to 2.66%26, 27 (Level II) and contrast iodine-induced hyperthyroidism up to 1.7%.28,29 \n(Level II,III) Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is more prevalent, and is in the range  \nof 3.0%–20.8%.30, 31, 32, 33 (Level III) There are other rare case reports of thyrotoxicosis  \nsuch as due to L-asparaginase chemotherapy, which leads to transient \nthyrotoxicosis.34 (Level III)\n2.1.2 How To Diagnose Hyperthyroidism?\n2.1.2.1 Biochemical Evaluation For Diagnosis Of Hyperthyroidism \nSerum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity \nand specificity of any single blood test and is used as an initial screening test for \nhyperthyroidism.35 (Level III) However, diagnostic accuracy is improved when serum \nTSH and free T4 (fT4) are assessed at initial evaluation. If fT4 is within the normal \nrange and TSH is suppressed, then free T3 (fT3) should be measured. In overt \nhyperthyroidism, serum fT4, fT3, or both are elevated and serum TSH is suppressed \n(usually <0.01 mIU/L).4(Level III)\n2.1.2.2 Diagnostic Testing For Aetiology Of Hyperthyroidism\nThyroid Ultrasound\nWhen expertise is available and there is no stigmata of Graves’ disease and the \naetiology not clear by history, thyroid ultrasound comprising both conventional \ngreyscale and colour flow Doppler examination is recommended as the imaging \nprocedure for hyperthyroidism work-up. Thyroid vascularity (Table 1) and peak \nsystolic velocity (PSV) of the inferior thyroid artery are useful markers to distinguish \nbetween Graves’ disease and thyroiditis, especially in the setting of pregnancy or",

The advantages of 99mTc include the high availability in the nuclear medicine \ndepartment, low energy of gamma photons, and the relatively short half-life \n(six hours). These characteristics make 99mTc a more preferred option compared to \n123I.49 (Level III)\n Recommendations\n • In patients with suspected hyperthyroidism, serum TSH and fT4 should \nbe obtained at the initial evaluation. fT3 should be measured when TSH is \nsuppressed but fT4 is within the normal range",

Thyroid storm occurs only rarely \nfollowing the administration of RAI. However, RAI can induce a short-term increase \nof thyroid hormone levels. To prevent a clinical exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, the \nuse of methimazole (MMI) or carbimazole, before and after RAI treatment may be \nconsidered in patients with severe hyperthyroidism, the elderly, and individuals with \nsubstantial comorbidity that puts them at greater risk for complications of worsening",

A special diet is not required before RAI therapy, \nbut nutritional supplements that may contain excess iodine and seaweeds should \nbe avoided for at least seven days. A low-iodine diet may be useful for those with \nrelatively low RAIU to increase the proportion of RAI trapped. Patients who might \nbenefit from adjunctive MMI or carbimazole may be those who tolerate hyperthyroid \nsymptoms poorly. Such patients frequently have free T4 at 2–3 times the upper \nlimit of normal. Young and middle-aged patients who are otherwise healthy and \nclinically well compensated despite significant biochemical hyperthyroidism can \ngenerally receive RAI without pretreatment. If given as pretreatment, MMI and \ncarbimazole should be discontinued before the administration of RAI. Continuation \nof ATDs up to 2–3 days prior to RAI can prevent a short-term increase of thyroid \nhormone levels, which is found after six days. In elderly patients or in those with \nunderlying cardiovascular disease, resuming MMI or carbimazole 3–7 days after \nRAI administration should be considered and generally tapered as thyroid function \nnormalises. In selected patients with Graves’ hyperthyroidism who would have \nbeen candidates for pretreatment with ATDs because of comorbidities or excessive \nsymptoms, but who are allergic to ATDs, the duration of hyperthyroidism may be \nshortened by administering iodine (e.g. saturated solution of potassium iodide \n[SSKI]) beginning a week after RAI administration.4 (Level II)\nThe goal of RAI therapy in GD is to control hyperthyroidism by rendering the patient \nhypothyroid; this treatment is very effective, provided a sufficient radiation dose \nis deposited in the thyroid. This outcome can be accomplished equally well by \neither administering a fixed dose or by calculating the activity based on the size of \nthe thyroid and its ability to trap RAI. The first method is simple, while the second \nmethod requires two unknowns to be determined: the uptake of RAI and the size of \nthe thyroid.4 (Level II)\nAnti-Thyroid Drugs (ATDs)\nThe goal of the therapy is to render the patient euthyroid as quickly and safely as \npossible. These medications do not cure Graves’ hyperthyroidism; however, when \ngiven in adequate doses, they are very effective in controlling hyperthyroidism. When \nthey fail to achieve euthyroidism, the usual cause is nonadherence. The treatment \nitself might have a beneficial immunosuppressive role, either to primarily decrease \nthyroid-specific autoimmunity, or secondarily, by ameliorating the hyperthyroid \nstate, which may restore the dysregulated immune system back to normal. \nCarbimazole is rapidly converted to MMI in the serum (10 mg of carbimazole is \nmetabolised to approximately 6 mg of MMI). They work in an identical fashion, and \nboth are effective as a single daily dose. At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of \n10–30 mg daily are used to restore euthyroidism, and the dose can then be titrated \ndown to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). The dose of MMI should be \ntargeted to the degree of thyroid dysfunction because too low dose will not restore \na euthyroid state in patients with severe disease and an excessive dose can cause \niatrogenic hypothyroidism in patients with mild disease. In addition, adverse drug \nreactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses. Thus, it is important to use",

It is important to monitor \nserum T3 levels initially because some patients normalise their free T4 levels with \nMMI, but have persistently elevated serum T3, indicating continuing thyrotoxicosis. \nMethimazole has the benefit of once-a–day administration and a reduced risk \nof major side effects compared to propylthiouracil (PTU). Propylthiouracil has a  \nshorter duration of action and is usually administered two or three times daily, \nstarting with 50–150 mg three times daily, depending on the severity of the \nhyperthyroidism. As clinical findings and thyroid function tests results return to \nnormal, a reduction to a maintenance PTU dose of 50 mg two or three times daily \nis usually possible. When more rapid biochemical control is needed in patients with \nsevere thyrotoxicosis, an initial split dose of MMI (e.g. 15 or 20 mg twice a day) \nmaybe more effective than a single daily dose because the duration of action of MMI \nmay be less than 24 hours.4 (Level II)\nThe adverse effects of ATDs can be divided into common, minor allergic side effects \nand rare but serious allergic/toxic events such as agranulocytosis, vasculitis, or \nhepatic damage. The minor allergic reactions included pruritus or a limited, minor \nrash. Cutaneous reactions were more common with PTU or higher dose MMI \n(30 mg/day) compared with lower dose MMI (15 mg/day). Hepatotoxicity was more \ncommon with PTU.4 (Level II)\nA patient is considered to be in remission if they have had a normal serum TSH, \nfree T4, and free T3 for a year after discontinuation of ATD therapy. The remission \nrate varies considerably between geographical areas. A meta-analysis shows \nthe remission rate in adults is not improved by a course of ATDs longer than 18 \nmonths. A lower remission rate has been described in men, smokers (especially \nmen), and those with large goitres (>80 g). Higher initial doses of MMI (60–80 mg/\nday) do not improve remission rates; they increase the risk of side effects and are \nnot recommended.

In such patients, the thyroid gland \noften remains palpable.\nBeta-blockers that were instituted prior to RAI treatment should be tapered when \nfree T4 and free T3 have returned to the reference range. As free T4 and free T3 \nimprove, ATDs can usually be tapered, which allows an assessment of the response \nto RAI. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism, which is indicated by a \nfree T4 below the normal range. At this point, levothyroxine should be instituted. \nTSH levels may not rise immediately with the development of hypothyroidism \nand should not be used initially to determine the need for levothyroxine. When \nthyroid hormone replacement is initiated, the dose should be adjusted based on \nan assessment of free T4. Overt hypothyroidism should be avoided, especially in \npatients with active GO.\nOnce euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is \nrecommended at least annually, or if the patient experiences symptoms of \nhypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Since TSH levels may remain suppressed for \na month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, the levels should be interpreted \ncautiously and only in concert with free T4 and free T3.4 (Level II)\nResponse to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, \nthyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms. The goal of re-treatment is to \ncontrol hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid. \nPatients who have persistent, suppressed TSH with normal free T3 and free T4 \nmay not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely for either \nrelapse or development of hypothyroidism. In the small percentage of patients \nwith hyperthyroidism refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be \nconsidered.4 (Level II)\nPatients Treated With ATD\nPeriodic clinical and biochemical evaluation of thyroid status in patients taking \nATDs is necessary, and it is essential that patients understand its importance. An \nassessment of serum free T4 and free T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks \nafter initiation of therapy, depending on the severity of the thyrotoxicosis, and the \ndose of medication should be adjusted accordingly. Serum T3 should be monitored \nbecause the serum free T4 levels may normalise despite persistent elevation of \nserum free T3. Serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months after starting \ntherapy, and it is therefore not a good parameter for monitoring therapy early in \nthe course. Once the patient is euthyroid, the dose of MMI can usually be decreased \nby 30%–50% and biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks. Once euthyroid levels \nare achieved with the minimal dose of medication, clinical and laboratory evaluation \ncan be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months. If a patient is receiving long-term MMI \n(>18 months), this interval can be increased to 6 months.4 (Level II)",

However, changes in clinical symptoms should be followed \nlongitudinally and taken into consideration together with serum TSH and thyroid \nhormones levels, comorbidities, and other potential causes.91 (Level I)\n3.1.3 How Should Levothyroxine Administration Be Timed With  \nRespect To Meals And Beverages In Order To Maintain Maximum,  \nConsistent Absorption?\nWhen levothyroxine is co-administered with food, absorption is reduced compared \nwith absorption in the fasting state.92 (level II) Taking levothyroxine at bedtime has been \nshown to be just as efficacious as taking it in the morning, with no significant changes \nin the TSH levels.93–94 (Level II) It is important to consider not only when the absorption \nof levothyroxine would be optimal, but also what timing promotes adherence.",

This is consistent \nwith the ileum being the main site of levothyroxine absorption.105-106 (Level II) It should \nalso be noted that autoimmune atrophic gastritis is particularly prevalent in older \npatients with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.107 (Level II)\n Recommendation\n • Evaluation for gastrointestinal disorders (H. pylori, atrophic gastritis, and \ncoeliac’s disease) should be considered in patients requiring a much higher-\nthan-expected dose of levothyroxine. If indeed such disorders are detected and \ntreated successfully, re-assessment of thyroid function is necessary, and the \nlevothyroxine dose adjusted accordingly \n3.1.6 What Medications May Alter A Patient’s Levothyroxine Requirement By \nAffecting Either Metabolism Or Binding To Transport Proteins?\nAdjustment of levothyroxine dose may be necessary for the use of medications  \nthat alter T4 metabolism or change the concentration of thyroxine-binding  \nglobulin.91 (Level I) The need to increase the levothyroxine dose substantially has  \nbeen reported in athyreotic patients prescribed tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as \nimatinib and sunitinib.90 (Level II)\n Recommendation\n • Serum TSH should be reassessed at initiation or discontinuation of oestrogen and \nandrogens (may alter levothyroxine requirement), and at the commencement \nof agents (such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors) that can affect thyroxine \nmetabolism and thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine deiodination. Monitoring of \nserum TSH is also advisable when patients are started on drugs that have been \nshown to increase hepatic metabolism of T4 and T3, i.e. antiepileptics such as \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, or other medications such as \nrifampicin and sertraline \n3.1.7 What Factors Determine The Levothyroxine Dose Required By A \nHypothyroid Patient For Reaching The Appropriate Serum TSH Goal?\nMany factors can affect the levothyroxine requirement to achieve normalisation \nof serum TSH levels.

Dose adjustments should be made when there are significant \nchanges in body weight, and with pregnancy and ageing. Serum TSH should be \nreassessed 4–8 weeks after any dose adjustments \n3.1.9 What Are The Potentially Deleterious Effects Of Excessive \nLevothyroxine?\nOvertreatment or iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis can result in atrial fibrillation and \naccelerated bone loss or osteoporosis. Therefore, thyroid hormone excess and \nsubnormal serum TSH level (especially values less than 0.1 mIU/L) should be \navoided, particularly in older people and postmenopausal women.\n(Refer to the section on subclinical hyperthyroidism and hyperthyroidism in the elderly.)\n3.1.10 What Are The Potentially Deleterious Effects Of Inadequate \nLevothyroxine?\nThyroid hormone deficiency can have detrimental effects on the serum lipid profile \nand result in the progression of cardiovascular disease.

In such cases, once \nweekly dosing has been shown to be effective and safe in reducing TSH  \nlevels.110–111 (Level II)\n Recommendation\n • Weekly oral administration of the full week’s dose of levothyroxine should be \nconsidered in patients in whom adherence cannot otherwise be sustained \n3.1.13 What Biochemical Goals Should Be Employed For Levothyroxine \nReplacement In Patients With Secondary Hypothyroidism?\nA randomised controlled trial showed that patients given a dose of 1.6 mg/kg/\nday produced fT4 that reached the upper part of the reference range, and it was \nassociated with lower body weight, lower BMI, lower cholesterol, and fewer clinical \nsigns of hypothyroidism, based on the Zulewski score.

Higher serum fT4 (but not fT3) was \nassociated with lower GHQ-12 scores, implying improved well-being.116 (Level II) Another \ncommunity-based study from Norway suggested a higher prevalence of depression \nand anxiety, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) \nscores in hypothyroid women aged 40 years and older taking levothyroxine.117 (Level II) \nIn a third study from the USA, levothyroxine-treated women were shown to have \ndecrements in health status, psychological function, working memory, and motor \nlearning compared to euthyroid controls. However, correlations between TSH \nlevels and outcomes were not found.118 (Level II) The evidence suggests that despite \nnormal serum TSH levels, psychological distress, impaired well-being, and cognitive \ndisturbances occur more often in patients with hypothyroidism treated with \nlevothyroxine monotherapy than controls and that 5%–10% of patients treated with \nlevothyroxine monotherapy with normal serum TSH can have persistent symptoms \nrelated to the disease and therapy.\n3.1.16 Is There A Biological Rationale For Persistent Complaints In  \nL-T4–Treated Hypothyroid Patients?\nTwo most common causes of hypothyroidism are Hashimoto’s disease and \nthyroid ablation in Graves’ disease, and therefore most hypothyroid patients have \nautoimmune thyroid disease. Autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with \nother autoimmune disorders, with rheumatoid arthritis being the most common \ncoexisting autoimmune disorder. Also, there are significantly increased relative risks \nfor almost all other autoimmune diseases (RR >10 for systemic lupus erythematosus, \nAddison’s disease, pernicious anaemia, coeliac disease, and vitiligo). Due to the \nnonspecific nature of associated symptoms, many of these conditions may go \nunnoticed for a long time. Therefore, screening for other autoimmune diseases has \nbeen recommended for patients with autoimmune thyroid disease who present \nwith new or unresolving non-specific symptoms.119–121 (Level II)\nPersistent symptoms despite normal serum TSH levels in patients with \nhypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine monotherapy have been suggested \nto be due to the patients’ awareness of a chronic disease, thyroid autoimmunity",

Repeat measurements of TSH at two-to-three–month intervals from the \ninitial finding of a raised TSH are reasonable.125 (Level III)\n3.2.2 How To Diagnose Subclinical Hypothyroidism?\nSubclinical thyroid disease is a laboratory diagnosis. It is defined as a serum TSH \nconcentration above the statistically defined upper limit of the reference range \nwhen serum fT4 and T3 concentrations are within their reference ranges.126 (Level I); \n127 (Level I; 128 (Level I) However, since an array of factors has been shown to lead to \ntransient abnormalities of serum TSH, investigation for raised TSH requires repeat \nmeasurements within two to three months to establish a firm diagnosis.128 (Level 1) \nTransient elevations of TSH may occur in numerous circumstances, such as subacute \nor painless thyroiditis, following withdrawal of L-thyroxine, during recovery from \na significant non-thyroidal illness, and during treatment with various drugs (e.g. \nlithium, amiodarone).128 (Level I) Patients with subclinical disease may have few or no \ndefinitive clinical signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.128 (Level I) Serum TSH has \na log-linear relationship with circulating thyroid hormone levels (a two-fold change  \nin free thyroxine will produce a 100-fold change in TSH).125 (Level I) The generally  \naccepted reference range for serum TSH is 0.40–4.2 mIU/L.125 (Level I); 129 (Level IV) \nDetermination of anti-TPO antibodies may be helpful in defining the risk of \nprogression (2.6% each year if thyroid peroxidase [TPO] antibodies are absent and",

The only large study to \nsystematically investigate symptoms in patients with overt and SCHypo as compared \nto euthyroid controls is the Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence study. This large \nquestionnaire-based study conducted among 25,862 subjects reported a small but \nsignificant difference in symptoms between euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid \npatients. The main problems reported were drier skin, poorer memory, slower \nthinking, weaker muscles, greater tiredness, more muscle cramps, more feeling cold, \ndeeper and hoarser voice, puffier eyes, and more constipation in SCHypo.133 (Level IV)\nThe Tromsö study compared symptoms in 154 controls and 89 SCHypo subjects with \na TSH between 3.5 and 10.0 mIU/L using a similar panel of questions. Tiredness, but \nnone of the other symptoms, was significantly different between the groups.134 (Level IV) \nThese studies suggest that some patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do indeed \ndevelop clinical manifestations of mild thyroid failure.\nPatients with SCHypo have a high rate of progression to clinically overt \nhypothyroidism. In a prospective cohort study by Gerold Huber, Jean-Jacques  \nStaub et al., 82 women with subclinical hypothyroidism underwent a follow-up \nfor a mean of 9.2 years. Patients were classified into three groups on the basis of  \ntheir initial TSH values: ≥4 to 6, 6 to 12, and greater than 12 µIU/mL. The 10-year \nincidence of hypothyroidism was 0%, 42.8%, and 76.9%, respectively, in these three \ngroups.135 (Level IV) The rate of progression to overt hypothyroidism was significantly \nhigher in women with a higher baseline serum TSH concentration.133 (Level IV) The \npresence of anti-TPO antibodies was also correlated with a significantly increased \nincidence of progression to overt hypothyroidism.135 (Level IV); 136 (Level IV); 137 (Level IV) However, \nsome people do not show progression and some experience normalisation.135 (Level IV); \n136 (Level IV); 137 (Level IV); 138 (Level IV)",

Thyroid nodules are generally benign \nhyperplastic (or colloid) nodules or benign follicular adenomas and, uncommonly, \ncarcinoma occurs in 5%–10% of nodules. A nontoxic goitre is defined as any thyroid \nenlargement characterised by uniform or selective growth of thyroid tissue that is \nnot associated with overt hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism and that does not \nresult from inflammation or neoplasia.\n4.1 HOW COMMON ARE THYROID NODULES/GOITRE?\nThe prevalence of goitre, diffuse or nodular, differs widely depending on iodine \nintake by the population. Goitre may occur endemically, due mainly to iodine \ndeficiency, or sporadically. By using ultrasonography as the screening method, a \nprevalence of up to 30%–50% of an unselected adult population has been described \nas having goitre, with a higher prevalence noted in iodine-deficient areas and in \nolder people. \nThyroid nodules are a common clinical finding. In large population-based  \nstudies, the estimated prevalence of thyroid nodules detected by palpation is  \n4%–7%.145–146 (Level II) Imaging studies identify up to 10 times more nodules, mostly \nbenign. On ultrasonography, detection rates of clinically in-apparent thyroid \nnodules of 20%–75% have been reported in the general population. Thyroid nodules \nare more common in elderly individuals, females, subjects from iodine-deficient",

Therefore, affected patients do not have any symptoms or \nsigns of thyroid dysfunction and present with neck lump or swelling. About 70% of \npatients with sporadic nontoxic goitre complains of neck discomfort. Some patients \nhave concerns about cosmetic appearance and fear of possible malignancy.\nLarge goitres may displace or compress the trachea, oesophagus, and neck vessels. \nThere may be compressive symptoms and signs such as inspiratory stridor, \ndysphagia, or a choking sensation. Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve \ncan result in hoarseness of voice due to vocal cord paralysis, usually associated with \nthyroid malignancy.\n4.3 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THYROID NODULES/GOITRE\nThe main objective of the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is to differentiate malignant \nlesions from benign conditions. Most nodules are asymptomatic and benign. The \ninitial evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule should include a complete history \nand physical examination.149 (Level III)\nHistorical features that favour benign disease are a family history of Hashimoto’s \nthyroiditis, benign thyroid nodule/goitre, and symptoms of hypothyroidism/\nhyperthyroidism. A sudden increase in the size of the nodule with pain and \ntenderness suggests a cyst or localised thyroiditis.149 (Level III)\nHistorical features that suggest malignancy:\n•\t\nYoung age (<20 years) or old age (>60 years)\n•\t\nMale gender\n•\t\nHistory of external neck radiation during childhood/adolescence\n•\t\nRapid growth\n•\t\nRecent changes in speaking, breathing, or swallowing\n•\t\nFamily history of thyroid cancer or MEN type 2\nPhysical manifestations of thyroid malignancy:\n•\t\nFirm to hard consistency of nodule\n•\t\nIrregular shape\n•\t\nFixation to underlying or overlying tissues\n•\t\nVocal cord paralysis\n•\t\nSuspicious regional lymphadenopathy",

Nodule characteristics include composition  \n(solid/cystic proportion), echogenicity, shape if taller than wide, margins, and \npresence of echogenic profile.151 (Level III)  \n4.4.1 How To Describe Ultrasound Findings For Thyroid Nodules? \nA structured assessment followed by a practical and standardised reporting \nformat with details of specific sonographic characteristics of thyroid nodules \nis necessary to standardise diagnosis, risk stratification and the subsequent \nmanagement decision. \nThe American College of Radiology ACR TI-RADS 2017 structured reporting system is \nbest recommended as it is easy-to–use, robust and reproducible and widely accepted \nby radiologists. This reporting system enables assessment of thyroid malignancy \nrisk and helps select patients for FNA and/or surgery, and may substantially reduce \nthe number of unnecessary invasive procedures. The structured reporting greatly \nfacilitates communication between radiologists and physicians, as well as between \npractitioners and patients.\nFor patients with multiple nodules (≥4) present, only the four highest scoring \nnodules, should be scored, reported, and followed up. Follow up shall be according \nto the highest grade TI-RADS nodule available. Other nodules are also reassessed \nwith ultrasound. Interval enlargement on follow up is significant if there is an \nincrease of 20% and 2 mm in two dimensions, or a 50% increase in volume. If the \nACR TI‑RADS level increases between scans, an interval scan the following year \nis again recommended. Ultrasound follow up of a thyroid nodule can be ceased  \nafter 5 years if there is no increment in TI- RADS grade and size. Thus stability of \nthe nodule over that time span reliabily indicates that the nodule has a benign \ncharacteristic. \n4.5 FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY (FNAB) OF THYROID NODULES\nFine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of thyroid nodules is the main technique for \ndiagnosing thyroid cancer; it has high sensitivity and specificity rates. The technique \nis easy to perform and safe. It requires an adequate specimen, which should contain \nat least five or six groups of 10–15 well-preserved cells. Ultrasound-guided FNAB \nreduces the possibility of non-diagnostic specimens and is preferred in nodules with \na higher likelihood of either non-diagnostic cytology (>25–50% cystic) or sampling \nerror (non-palpable or posterior location).151 (Level III)\nFNAB is recommended for suspicious lesions (TR3–TR5) with the specific size criteria, \naccording to the ACR Ti-RADS 2017 management algorithm (Refer Figure 6)\n• \nTR1: no FNA required\n• \nTR2: no FNA required",

The decision to use aggressive treatment for patients with BWPS \n25–44 would depend on clinical judgement, weighing against the risk of adverse \nevents from therapy.4 (Level III) Retrospective audits comparing the BWPS versus JTA \ngenerally show agreement between the two methods, but there was a tendency for \nunderdiagnosis with the JTA.159(Level III); 162 (Level III) If the clinician is unsure whether the \nsymptoms are due to thyroid storm or an underlying disease, symptoms should be \nregarded as due to thyroid storm. Although measurement of fT4, fT3, and TSH are \nrequired, these values may not correlate with the severity of clinical presentation.\n Recommendations\n • The diagnosis of thyroid storm is clinical. Both the BWPS and JTA diagnostic \ntools could be used to aid diagnosis, but we recommend the use of BWPS, as \nthis scoring tool is more sensitive \n • BWPS score ≥45 or TS1 is definitive of thyroid storm\n • BWPS score of 25–44 or TS2, clinical judgement to look for decompensation \nshould be used to diagnose thyroid storm \n5.1.2 What Is The Anti-thyroid Drug Of Choice In Thyroid Storm?\nEarly and aggressive multimodal therapy is required for resolution of thyroid storm. \nThe treatment strategies for thyroid storm are aimed at:\na)\t Inhibiting synthesis and release of thyroid hormone\nb)\t Inhibiting peripheral action of thyroid hormone\nc)\t Reversing systemic decompensation\nd)\t Treating precipitating event\ne)\t Addressing definitive therapy\nHigh doses of propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole (MMI) are mainly targeted at \ninhibiting the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. The recommended dosing \nfor PTU is a loading of 500–1000 mg, then 250 mg four-hourly and, for MMI 60–80 \nmg/day, a single dose or divided into two equal doses.4 (Level III) PTU is preferentially \nused in comparison to MMI in thyroid storm, as the latter has the added benefit of \ninhibiting type I deiodinase activity in the thyroid gland and other peripheral organs, \ntherefore reducing the conversion of T4 to T3.4 (Level III); 163 (Level III); 164 (Level III) T3 levels drop \nby 45% within one hour of PTU administration, but only about 10%–15% after \nstarting MMI.163 (Level III) However, the Japan nationwide survey indicated that there was \nno difference in outcomes between those treated with PTU vs. MMI.165 (Level III); 166 (Level III) \nMMI has the added benefit of less frequent dosing and less hepatotoxicity.167 (Level III) \nWith such large doses of ATD administered, monitoring for adverse events such as \nliver dysfunction, rash, and agranulocytosis should be carried out.",

In the presence of contraindications, high doses of MMI \n(60–80 mg/day) can be used. \n • Upon improvement of thyroid storm, patients should be transitioned to MMI. \n5.1.3 Are Rectal Anti-thyroid Drugs Useful?\nIn conditions where the absorption of oral PTU or MMI is compromised, such as in \nventilated patients or in those with conditions that impair absorption, rectal PTU or \nMMI can be used. The dose and frequency are similar to those for the oral route. \n(See guide to prepare rectal PTU in Table 11). The pharmacological levels of rectal \nand oral preparations are similar, and rectal antithyroids have been reported to \nresolve thyroid storm.168 (Level III); 169 (Level III); 170 (Level III); 171 (Level III)\nTable 11: Preparation of rectal PTU\nPTU enema: 400 mg of PTU in 90 mL of sterile water170 (Level II)\nPTU suppository: Polyethylene glycol base (200 mg of PTU in each)171 (Level III)\n Recommendation\n • In circumstances in which absorption is impaired, rectal preparations of PTU or \nMMI can be used \n5.1.4 What Is The Role Of Beta-adrenergic Receptor Antagonists?\nBeta-adrenergic receptor antagonists are key to control heart rate and inhibit \nother peripheral actions of thyroid hormones in thyroid storm. Preferentially \nb-blockers with the ability to inhibit type 1 deiodinase such as propranolol  \n(60–80 mg/four-hourly) are used.4 (Level III) Caution should be exercised with patients \nin decompensated heart failure. Beta-blockers with selective b-1 blockade such as \nbisoprolol, landiolol, and esmolol infusion have more favourable cardiovascular \nbenefits in thyroid storm with significant cardiac compromise.166(Level III) If there \nare contraindications to b-blockers, such as in patients with bronchial asthma or \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardioselective calcium-channel \nblockers such as diltiazem160(Level III) or intravenous esmolol with shorter half-\nlives and easier reversibility can be used in the intensive care setting to control  \nheart rate.172(Level  III) Intravenous esmolol infusions are given at a loading dose \nof 250–500 mcg/kg, and thereafter at 50–100 mcg/kg/min of infusion, which is  \ntitrated to heart rate and blood pressure. In patients with atrial fibrillation, \ncardioversion should be considered after ruling out cardiac thrombosis if \nhaemodynamics are impaired. A CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, \nage ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke [double weight]) score ≥2 will require \nanticoagulation.166 (Level III); 173 (Level III)",

With the improvement in clinical condition, doses should be \nreduced and tapered off to prevent adverse effects.\n Recommendation\n • High doses of glucocorticoids (IV hydrocortisone 100 mg, 6 hourly or \ndexamethasone 2 mg, 6 hourly) should be given in thyroid storm \n5.1.6 What Is The Role Of Inorganic Iodide?\nInorganic iodide (Lugol’s iodine/saturated solution of potassium iodide, SSKI) can be \nused in thyroid storm to rapidly decrease T4 levels by inhibition of iodide oxidation \nand organification and inhibits release of thyroid hormone.161 (Level III); 176 (Level III); 177 (Level III); \n178 (Level III) These agents must be used in combination with antithyroid drugs for rapid \nclinical improvement. Inorganic iodide can reduce thyroid hormone faster than \nsteroids or antithyroid drugs.161 (Level III) Recommended dose is 5 drops of Lugol’s \niodine 6 hourly (6.25 mg iodine/drop) or 10 drops of Lugol’s iodine 8 hourly.161 (Level III);  \n4 (Level III) It is important to note that these agents should only be given at least after one \nhour of antithyroid drug administration, to prevent the use of iodine as a substrate \nfor thyroid hormone synthesis.178(Level III) After clinical improvement, the Lugol’s iodine \nshould be tapered and stopped before the antithyroid. Lugol’s iodine should not \nbe given beyond 10 days or else this would lead to escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff \nphenomenon. Patients known to be allergic to inorganic iodide containing drugs \nshould not be given these agents. Inorganic iodide may also be administered via \nrectal or nasogastric routes in critically ill patients. The solution should be diluted in \nwater or taken with bread to avoid mucosal irritation.",

Adverse effects that need to be considered are lithium \ntoxicity and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Therefore, lithium levels should be  \nmonitored to avoid toxicity. Cholestyramine has been used as an option to improve \nthyrotoxic state in thyroid storm by reducing enterohepatic recycling of thyroid \nhormones.181 (Level III); 182 (Level III); 183 (Level III) Recommended dose of cholestyramine is  \n1–4 g/every 6 hourly.\n Recommendation\n • Lithium and cholestyramine can be used as adjunct treatment for thyroid  \nstorm \n5.1.8 What Is The Role Of Plasma Exchange?\nTotal plasma exchange (TPE) is used in patients with severe thyroid storm, \nrapid clinical worsening or failure or contraindications to standard multimodal \ntherapy.4  (Level III) Failure to standard therapy is considered when thyroid storm \nshows no improvement within 24–48 hours of standard multimodal therapy. \nTotal plasma exchange removes thyroid hormones, antibodies, and circulating \ncytokines. Total plasma exchange with 40–50 mL/kg of replacement fluid has \ndemonstrated improved outcomes and resolution of thyroid storm and should \nbe continued until clinical improvements are noted.184 (Level III); 185 (Level III) fT4 and fT3 \nshould be sampled before and after each session. Two types of replacement \ntherapy: fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or albumin have been used in TPE for \nthyroid storm. Although there is no randomised study to compare between  \nthe two, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has been preferentially used because it contains \nthyroid binding globulin (TBG) that will better enhance removal of TBG bound \nthyroid hormones.166 (Level III) Continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) is sometimes used \nin parallel with TPE in haemodynamically compromised patients.166 (Level III)\n Recommendation\n • TPE (with FFP as fluid replacement) should be considered in severe/rapidly \ndeteriorating thyroid storm or with contraindications to standard multimodal \ntherapy",

These include \nintravenous fluids, respiratory support, and nutritional support. Cooling measures \nusing cooling blankets and with the use of acetaminophen is recommended. The use \nof salicylates should be avoided as these drugs displace bound thyroxine leading \nto further elevations of free thyroid hormone.4 (Level III); 166 (Level III) Infection should be \ntreated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, tailored to source of infection. In patients \nwith respiratory failure or severe CNS depression, respiratory support with invasive \nor non-invasive ventilation may be required.\n Recommendation\n • The use of salicylates should be avoided as these drugs displace bound \nthyroxine leading to further elevations of free thyroid hormone \n5.1.10 What Is The Role Of Early Definitive Therapy And Prevention?\nDefinitive therapy needs to be considered in all patients presenting with thyroid \nstorm. Urgent or early thyroidectomy is an option in patients who have a \ncontraindication to antithyroid drugs, have a large goitre.186 (Level III); 187 (Level III) However, \nthese patients should be rendered close to euthyroid prior to surgery with methods \nsuch as TPE in order to minimise risk of thyroid storm. If radioactive iodine is \nconsidered and Lugol’s iodine has been administered during thyroid storm, the RAI \nshould be deferred until about 3–4 months after.161 (Level III) Commonest precipitating \nfactor is non-compliance and patients therefore should be educated on this  \naspect. Patients undergoing surgery or RAI should be rendered near euthyroid as \npossible prior to procedure or the procedures should be postponed to prevent \nthyroid storm.\n Recommendation\n • All patients with thyroid storm should have early definitive therapy with \nRAI. In patients with large obstructing goitre, early thyroidectomy should be \nconsidered instead\n5.2  MYXOEDEMA COMA\n5.2.1 How Is Myxoedema Coma Diagnosed?\nMyxoedema coma is a rare condition which is diagnosed clinically in patients \npresenting with hallmarks of reduced conscious level and hypothermia. Thyroid \nfunction test will be consistent with hypothyroidism. Other clinical features \nare hyponatremia and/or hypercapnia. It should be suspected especially in \npatients with history of hypothyroidism or with any cause for hypothyroidism.  \nOther causes of reduced consciousness should also be excluded.188–191 (Level III)",

Absorption of oral medications may \nbe impaired and reduced in these patients due to multiple factors. Therefore,  \nintravenous thyroxine is recommended by most authors.192 (Level II)-, 188, 198, \n190,  91 (Level  III) These patients may also have concurrent hypoadrenalism, thus \nintravenous hydrocortisone is recommended prior to commencement of thyroid \nhormones.188  (Level III) Ideally a serum cortisol is taken prior to administration of \nintravenous hydrocortisone.\n Recommendations\n • Intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg stat then 100 mg 6–8 hourly should be \nadministered prior to levothyroxine \n • Initial intravenous levothyroxine of 200–400 mcg followed by 1.6 mcg/kg/day \n(75% if administered intravenously) should be given thereafter. If intravenous \nlevothyroxine is not available, oral levothyroxine can be given as 500 mcg \nloading followed by maintenance dose \n • Intravenous liothyronine (when available) may be given in addition to thyroxine. \nLoading dose recommended is 5–20 mcg followed by 2.5–10 mcg every 8 hours \ntill patient regains consciousness \n5.2.4 How Should Patients With Myxoedema Coma Be Monitored?\nImprovements can be seen within one week of treatment. As with all critically ill \npatients, multiorgan parameters should be monitored including mental status \ncardiovascular parameters, respiratory parameters, renal function, metabolic \nparameters (e.g. electrolytes). Thyroid function test can be monitored every 2 days. \nSequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is an example of assessment tool \nthat has been used and was found to be more predictive of outcome compared to \nother tools.192 (Level II); 190 (Level III)",

Typically, the hyperthyroid \nstate lasts for 2–3 weeks, peaks at 1 week after the onset, followed by a period \nof hypothyroidism which lasts for 6–12 weeks. Subsequently, euthyroid state \nensues.211 (Level III); 219 (Level III) Most of studies recorded moderate increase in thyroxine level  \nwith suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone, while thyroid storm is rare. 210 (Level III);  \n211 (Level III); 212 (Level III); 213 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 216 (Level III) A cross-sectional study comparing the  \nthyroid function of patients with subacute thyroiditis and Graves’ disease \ndemonstrates that the free tri-iodothyronine (fT3) to free thyroxine (fT4) was \nsignificantly lower in the former. An fT3/fT4 ratio of less than 0.3 has a sensitivity \nof 52.4% and specificity of 91.3% for destructive thyroiditis.220 (Level II) Apart from \nthyroxine and triiodothyronine, thyroglobulin levels are also elevated.213 (Level III);  \n216 (Level III); 219 (Level III) The presence of thyroid antibodies in subacute thyroiditis varies \nfrom study to study (between 4% and 20%).214 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 217 (Level III) However, \noverall, the thyroid antibody titre in destructive thyroiditis is much lower compared \nfrom Graves’ disease.219 (Level III);220 (Level II)\nRaised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is one of the important diagnostic \ncriteria.

Most of the studies were observational \nretrospective.212 (Level III); 213 (Level III); 214 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 216 (Level III) Patients either receive non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids or expectant management. \nThe American Thyroid Association recommends that NSAIDs are used for mild \ncases and prednisolone for severe ones.4 (Level III) Beta-blocker is used to alleviate \nsignificant thyroid symptoms.210 (Level III); 217 (Level III); 219 (Level III) In majority of cases, 90% of \npatients go into remission without any sequelae and only 10% went into permanent \nhypothyroidism requiring thyroxine replacement.210 (Level III), 219 (Level III)\nA non-randomised retrospective review of prednisolone vs. loxoprofen (NSAID) for \nthe treatment of subacute thyroiditis was done by Sato et al. (2016). The average \ndose of prednisolone given was 15 mg/day (range: 14–16 mg/day) vs. loxoprofen \n180 mg/day. They demonstrated that the time to normalisation of thyroid function \nwas quicker in the prednisolone group (22 vs. 32 days).213 (Level III) Similarly, Benbassat \net al. reported that those who received steroid had faster remission compared with \nNSAIDs.215 (Level III)\n Recommendations\n • Beta-blocker can be used in patients with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis \n • Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line therapy and should be \nused for patients with mild symptoms \n • Prednisolone should be used in patients who present with severe symptoms or \nfor those who do not respond to initial NSAID therapy \n6.1.3 What Is The Dosage Of Steroid Used To Treat Subacute Thyroiditis?\nIn a prospective non-randomised clinical trial, Kubota et al. demonstrated that \n15 mg/day of starting dose for prednisolone is an acceptable option for treatment of \nsubacute thyroiditis. The prednisolone dose was tapered 5 mg/day every 2 weeks. \nIn cases with persistent pain or high C-reactive protein, the dose is extended or \nincreased up to 40 weeks of total treatment.

The duration of prednisolone may be prolonged in cases with \npersistent symptoms or raised ESR or CRP \n6.1.4 How Long Should Patients With Subacute Thyroiditis Be Followed-up?\nOverall, from retrospective studies, the recurrent rate of subacute thyroiditis is \nextremely low over the longterm. In a retrospective cohort, the recurrence rate is \nonly 1.6% over a total of 13 years.211 (Level III) However, the recurrence rates are higher \nwithin the 1st year and tend to reduce over the years. In a retrospective review, the \nrecurrence rate was about 10% over a 5-year period of follow-up.214 (Level III) Another \nstudy reported a recurrence rate of 10% within 1 year, and 4% after more than a \nyear. The rate of hypothyroidism is as high as 34% in the first year and 15% after \n1 year.216 (Level III) Therefore, it would be sensible to have frequent follow-up within \nthe first 12 months, with reducing frequency over the next 5 years. Follow-up after \n5 years may not be necessary.\n Recommendation\n • Patients should be monitored for recurrence 6 monthly for the first 1 year and \nyearly for the next 5 years \n6.2 ACUTE/SUPPURATIVE THYROIDITIS\n6.2.1 How Is Acute Thyroiditis Diagnosed?\nAcute thyroiditis is a rare but life-threatening disorder. The clinical features of \nacute thyroiditis are quite similar to subacute thyroiditis but are of more severe \nintensity. Pain is a very prominent feature. Patients may also present with fever and \nlymphadenopathy. Local inflammation caused by the condition may contribute to \nupper airway obstruction. Patients may assume a posture to limit neck extension \nand fluctuance suggest the presence of abscess.217 (Level III)",

However, it is difficult to determine the exact morbidity and mortality of \nthis condition due to its low incidence.\n Recommendations\n • Beta-blocker can be used in patients with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis \n • Acute/suppurative thyroiditis should be treated with antibiotics and surgical \ndrainage determined by clinical judgement \n7. SPECIAL SITUATIONS\n7.1 HYPOTHYROIDISM AND PREGNANCY\n7.1.1 What Is The Definition Of Maternal Overt/Subclinical Hypothyroidism \n(OH/SCHypo)?\nMaternal Hypothyroidism is generally defined as the presence of an elevated \nserum TSH during pregnancy beyond the upper limit of the pregnancy-specific \nreference range. Overt maternal hypothyroidism is also characterised by a \ndecreased serum fT4 below the lower limit of the pregnancy specific reference \nrange while SCHypo is characterised by an isolated high TSH with fT4 within the \npregnancy-specific reference range. At present, serum TSH remains the main \ndeterminant used to guide treatment decisions and target. The difficulties lie in \nthe presence of substantial differences in the upper reference limits of pregnancy \nspecific reference range for TSH between populations which varies from 2.15 to  \n4.68 mIU/L.228 (Level II) It is therefore recommended that each institution should establish \ntheir own pregnancy-specific reference intervals for each trimester of pregnancy \nusing the local population. If this is not available, an arbitrary level of 4 mIU/L can be \nused as the TSH upper reference limit. This level represents a reduction of 0.5 mIU/L \nof the non-pregnant TSH upper reference limit for most assays.229 (Level II)\n Recommendations\n • Each institution should establish their own pregnancy specific reference \nintervals for each trimester of pregnancy using the local population \n • As there is no published data on the pregnancy specific reference range \nrepresentative of the Malaysian pregnant population, we recommend a TSH \nupper reference limit of 4 mIU/L \n7.1.2 What Are the Prevalence And Common Causes of Maternal \nHypothyroidism?\nThe prevalence of hypothyroidism in pregnancy ranges from 0.3% to 4.8%.230, 231 (Level III); \n232 (Level II); 233 (Level III); 234,235,236 (Level II) The onset of the disease in pregnancy is rare.235 (Level II) \nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism in pregnancy is chronic autoimmune \nthyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).230, 231, 233 (Level III) Other causes include previous",

Parallel to the  \ntreatment of hypothyroidism in the general population, it is reasonable to target  \nthe serum TSH in the lower half of the trimester specific pregnancy reference  \nrange for the local population.229 (Level II) If this is not available, a TSH goal of not  \nmore than 2.5 mIU/L should be achieved before conception and during the first \ntrimester. The TSH goal can be relaxed to 3.0 mIU/L in the second and third \ntrimester.230 (Level III) The TSH goal can be reverted to the normal reference range \nfor non-pregnant women after delivery, provided the patient is not immediately \nplanning for another conception.\n Recommendations\n • For hypothyroid women already treated with LT4 before conception, we \nrecommend a TSH goal of no more than 2.5 mIU/L before conception and \nduring the first trimester as the trimester specific reference range for Malaysian \npopulation is not available",

How Should It Be Monitored?\nAn increase in LT4 requirement occurs soon after conception at four to six weeks of \ngestation. The LT4 requirement gradually increases through mid-gestation between \n16–20 weeks and plateaus thereafter in the third trimester until delivery.267 (Level II) \nA retrospective observational study demonstrated a 45%–70% increment in LT4 \ndosing at the end pregnancy for women who received LT4 before conception.268 (Level II) \nAnother retrospective study demonstrated an increment of 13%–27% during the \nfirst trimester which further increased to 26%–51% by the second trimester with no \nsignificant further increase in the third trimester.269 (Level II) The percentage increment \nin LT4 requirement was generally higher for hypothyroidism post thyroidectomy or \nradioactive iodine compared to autoimmune thyroiditis.268 (Level II); 269 (Level II) A prospective \nRCT comparing two LT4 dosage increment strategies with increment of LT4 tablets \nby two tablets per week versus three tablets per week, i.e. 29% versus 43% in early \npregnancy showed that both strategies are equally effective in keeping the serum \nTSH within target, with the first strategy associated with a lower risk of overtreatment \nresulting in TSH suppression.270 (Level I) However, the target TSH in this study was up \nto 4.9 mIU/L, which is significantly higher than the pregnancy-specific TSH upper \nreference limit for most populations.228 (Level II) This study also showed that a thyroid \nfunction testing interval of four-weekly was able to detect more than 90% of all the \nabnormal values throughout pregnancy.270 (Level I) As the increased LT4 requirement \nduring gestation is due to the physiological requirement of an increased total body \nthyroxine pool during pregnancy, the LT4 dosing should be reduced to pre-pregnant \ndose upon delivery. However, an observational study on patients with Hashimoto’s \nthyroiditis revealed an increased LT4 requirement postpartum compared to before \nconception with no reduction versus during pregnancy was possibly related to \npostpartum exacerbation of autoimmune thyroiditis.271 (Level II)\n Recommendations\n • Pregnant women who are already treated with LT4 before conception are \nrecommended to have their LT4 dosage increased by 30%–50% upon conception \nwith a higher percentage being considered for post ablative hypothyroidism \nand lower percentage for autoimmune hypothyroidism \n • Thyroid function testing should be performed every four weeks from conception \nuntil mid-gestation and at least once during the middle of the third trimester \n • After delivery, the LT4 dosage can be generally re-adjusted to the prepregnancy \nrequirement",

A prospective RCT comparing the universal \nscreening versus case-finding approach for detection and treatment of thyroid \ndysfunction in pregnancy showed no difference in adverse outcomes.272 (Level I) Case-\nfinding approach is thus recommended over universal approach for screening of \nmaternal hypothyroidism. The test of choice is TSH as it is the most sensitive test in \ndetection of hypothyroidism. Risk factors that have been shown to be associated with \nincreased risk of maternal hypothyroidism include history of thyroid dysfunction; \ngoitre; known thyroid antibody positivity; age at or above 30 years; type 1 diabetes \nor other autoimmune disorders; history of pregnancy loss or preterm delivery; \ninfertility; history of thyroid surgery or head and neck radiation; morbid obesity; use \nof lithium or amiodarone; recent administration of iodinated radiologic contrast; \nresiding in area of moderate-to–severe iodine deficiency; family history of thyroid \ndisorders and two or more prior pregnancies.273 (Level II); 274 (Level II); 275 (Level II); 276 (Level II); 277 (Level II)\n Recommendations\n See ‘Appendix 2’\n7.2 HYPERTHYROIDISM AND PREGNANCY\n7.2.1 What Is the Prevalence Of Hyperthyroidism In Pregnancy?\nThe prevalence of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy ranges from 0.1% to 1.6% \nworldwide.278, 279 (Level II); 230, 280 (Level III); 281 (Level II); 282 (Level III) In the United States of America, \ntwo studies reported the incidence of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy: 5.9 per 1000 \nwomen and 3.77 per 1000 women, respectively.283 (Level II); 284 (Level III); 285 (Level II) In Malaysia, \nstudies have shown that the incidence of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is 0.9 per \n1000 deliveries.286 (Level II) The onset of the disease in pregnancy was rare.279 Grave’s \ndisease was the most common cause.230, 283, 285 (Level III); 286 (Level II) Previous history of \nthyroid disorder and family history of thyroid disorder were associated with thyroid \ndysfunction.283 (Level II)\n7.2.2 What Is The Definition Of Maternal Hyperthyroidism?\nMaternal hyperthyroidism is defined as suppressed serum TSH level with elevated \nfree tri-iodothyronine (fT3) and/or free thyroxine (fT4).

The TSH lower \nreference limit of the pregnancy-specific reference range between populations \nvaried between 0.02 and 0.41 mIU/L.228 (Level II) Thus, any subnormal serum TSH \nshould be evaluated in conjunction with serum fT4 value. It is recommended that \npopulation-based, trimester-specific reference ranges for serum TSH and fT4 should \nbe defined through the assessment of the local population data.229 (Level II); 4 (level II)\n Recommendations\n • Each institution should establish its own pregnancy-specific reference intervals \nfor each trimester of pregnancy using local population data \n • When a suppressed serum TSH is detected in the ﬁrst trimester, a medical \nhistory should be gathered, and physical examination, and measurement of \nmaternal serum fT4 concentrations should be performed\n7.2.3 What Are The Common Causes Of Hyperthyroidism In Pregnancy?\nThe two most common causes of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy are gestational \ntransient thyrotoxicosis (GTT) and Graves’ disease.229,4, 288 (Level III) Other causes include \ntoxic multinodular goitre, toxic adenoma and thyroiditis.229,4 (Level III) Rare causes \nin pregnancy include hyperthyroidism induced by beta-HCG in pregnancy such \nas multiple gestation, molar pregnancy and choriocarcinoma; which are often \nsubclinical.229,4 (Level III)\n7.2.4 How To Differentiate Gestational Transient Thyrotoxicosis (GTT) From \nGraves’ Disease (GD)?\nGestational transient thyrotoxicosis is a non-autoimmune transient disorder that \noccurs in the first trimester of pregnancy and is caused by the peak in hCG levels \nduring early pregnancy, leading to biochemical hyperthyroidism.289(LevelIII) It is generally \nasymptomatic, mild and self-limiting.4(Level III) However, more severe degrees of GTT are \nassociated with hyperemesis; whereby patients may develop signs and symptoms \nof hyperthyroidism.4(Level III) In the presence of an elevated T4 and suppressed TSH in \nearly pregnancy, GTT needs to be differentiated from Graves’ disease, since these \nare the two most common causes of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.4, 289(Level III) As they \nmay have similar clinical manifestations such as palpitations, anxiety, tremor and \nheat intolerance, a careful history and physical examination is very important in \nestablishing the aetiology.4, 229 (Level III)\nThe most likely aetiology in patients without a prior history of thyroid disease and \nstigmata of Graves’ disease (goitre and ophthalmopathy) and in the absence of \nTSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) is GTT.289,4,229 (Level III) The presence of TRAb is highly \nsuggestive of Graves’ disease.

The risk observed included \nvarious types of abdominal wall defects, aplasia cutis, atresias of digestive tract, \nurinary tract, respiratory (choanal atresia) and circulatory (ventricular septum) \ndefects.298,300 (Level ll-2)\nThe Danish study also noted an almost similar incidence rate of teratogenicity \nafter exposure to PTU298 (Level ll-2), which was previously considered non-teratogenic. \nHowever, these defects were less severe and consisted of face and neck \nmalformations (preauricular sinus and cysts) and urinary tract malformations \n(only in boys). As the majority of PTU-associated defects had been detected when \nthe children developed complications and received surgery for the defect later in \nchildhood,293,298 (Level ll-2) studies relying solely on birth defects at birth will not find this \nassociation.299 (Level III)\nThe major period of teratogenicity due to ATD was gestational weeks 6–10, the period \nof organ formation. Therefore, consideration on treatment strategy is appropriate. \nA woman who is on ATD should test for pregnancy and immediately contact her \ncaregiver to make a plan, once pregnancy is confirmed.300,228 (Level III)\nMany patients on ATD therapy gradually enter remission when made euthyroid. \nAlthough half of the hyperthyroid patients eventually relapse when the medication \nis withdrawn after 1–2 years of therapy, only a few patients who have become TRAb",

After stopping ATD, thyroid function testing needs \nto be closely monitored during the remaining first trimester. However, ATD should \nnot be stopped in some pregnant women who are at high risk of hyperthyroidism \nrelapse if ATD is withdrawn.304 (Level III) This will include: women who were started on \nATD therapy recently (<6 months), still have suppressed TSH, have a relatively high \nserum T3, high levels of TRAb, large goitre, active ophthalmopathy or other signs of \nactive disease.\nIf ATD has to be continued or started in early pregnancy to treat overt \nhyperthyroidism, the drug of choice is PTU. There is a risk of liver failure with the \nuse of PTU, but the risk of liver failure or agranulocytosis in pregnancy is much lower \nthan the risk of birth defects.293 (Level II) Patients on CMZ should be replaced with PTU \nin early pregnancy, using a dose ratio of 1:10301 (Level III) e.g. 200 mg PTU per day to \nreplace 20 mg CMZ. Because the half-life of PTU is considerably shorter, it should be \nused twice or thrice daily.\n Recommendations\n • Women taking ATD should be instructed to perform a pregnancy test as soon \nas possible, after a missed period. If the pregnancy test is positive, pregnant \nwomen should contact their caregiver immediately \n • During early pregnancy, consider discontinuation of antithyroid drugs in a \npatient who is euthyroid on low dose of CMZ (≤10 mg daily) or PTU (≤100 mg \ndaily), due to the potential teratogenic effects. Other factors to be considered \nbefore discontinuation of ATD include disease history, goitre size, duration of \ntreatment, recent thyroid function tests results, TRAb measurement and other \nclinical factors \n • If antithyroid medication is stopped, thyroid function testing and clinical \nexamination should be performed monthly to ensure the pregnant woman \nremains clinically and biochemically euthyroid \n • In pregnant women in whom ATD needs to be continued, PTU is recommended \nthroughout the first trimester \n • After first trimester, no recommendation can be made whether PTU should be \ncontinued or changed to CMZ \n7.2.9 How To Monitor Patients With Graves’ Disease On ATD In Pregnancy? \nAll ATD cross the placenta.229,4,230,302 (Level III) Therefore, foetal thyroid function might be \naffected.

Incidence in \nthe general population is 5.4%. About 22% of patients present with the classical form, \n30% with isolated thyrotoxicosis, and 48% with isolated hypothyroidism.312 (Level  III) \nThe thyrotoxic phase of PPT typically occurs between 2 and 6 months postpartum. \nAll episodes of thyrotoxicosis resolve spontaneously. The hypothyroid phase of PPT \noccurs from 3 to 12 months postpartum with about 20%–40% of cases resulting in \npermanent hypothyroidism in the ensuing 3–12 years.313 (Level III) A prospective study \nreported that 50% of women with PPT remained hypothyroid at the end of the first \npostpartum year.314 (Level III)\n7.3.2 What Is The Aetiology?\nIt is an autoimmune disorder associated with the presence of thyroid antibodies \n(TPOAb and TgAb), lymphocyte abnormalities, complement activation, increased \nlevels of IgG1, increased Natural Killer (NK) cell activity, and specific Human \nLeukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotypes.313 (Level III) Women who are thyroid Ab positive \nin the first trimester have a high risk of developing PPT, ranging from 33% to \n50%.313 (Level III) Women with the highest Ab titres also have the highest risk of PPT.

An elevated T4:T3 ratio \nsuggests the presence of PPT. Physical stigmata of GD, such as goitre with a bruit or \nophthalmopathy, are diagnostic when present. The radioiodine uptake is elevated \nor normal in GD and low in the thyrotoxic phase of PPT.313 (Level II)\n7.3.4 What Is The Management?\nDuring the thyrotoxic phase of PPT, symptomatic women may be treated with \nbeta-blockers.313 (Level III); 312 (Level III); 230 (Level III) A beta-blocker that is safe for lactating \nwomen, such as propranolol or metoprolol, at the lowest possible dose to alleviate \nsymptoms is the treatment of choice. Therapy is typically required for a few weeks. \nAntithyroid drugs are not recommended for the treatment of the thyrotoxic phase of  \nPPT.313 (Level III); 312 (Level III); 228 (Level III) LT4 treatment should be started during the hypothyroid \nphase of PPT if the patient is symptomatic, lactating or if the patient is considering \nanother conception. Asymptomatic women or women with mild symptoms who \nchoose not to be treated need to have their TFT checked every 4- to 8-weekly until a \neuthyroid state is restored.313 (Level III); 312 (Level III); 228 (Level III) Length of time that LT4 should \nbe continued has not been systematically evaluated. Maintain a euthyroid state in \nwomen who are attempting pregnancy or are pregnant. Tapering LT4 doses in order \nto determine whether the hypothyroid phase of PPT was transitory or permanent \ncan begin by 12 months postpartum. Tapering should be gradual and TSH should be \nmonitored every 6–8 weeks.313 (Level III)\n Recommendations\n • Women in thyrotoxic phase of PPT who are symptomatic should be treated \nwith beta blockers. Antithyroid drugs are not recommended \n • Women in hypothyroid phase of PPT and who are symptomatic should be  \ntreated with LT4. Women who are not treated need to have their TFT checked \nevery 4- to 8-weekly until a euthyroid state is restored \n • Women who choose to get pregnant again while in hypothyroid phase of PPT or \nwho are breastfeeding should be treated with LT4 \n • Women in hypothyroid phase of PPT who have been initiated on LT4 should \nstart tapering down LT4 after 12 months postpartum and TFT monitored 6- to \n8-weekly",

Nearly 10%–50% of women in whom the hypothyroid \nphase of PPT initially resolves will ultimately go on to develop permanent \nhypothyroidism.313 (Level III); 314 (Level III) Factors associated with an increased risk of \ndeveloping permanent hypothyroidism are multiparity, thyroid hypoechogenicity \non ultrasound, greater severity of the initial hypothyroidism, higher TPOAb titre, \ngreater maternal age, and a history of pregnancy loss.313 (Level III) Women with a prior \nhistory of PPT should have TSH testing annually to evaluate for the development \nof permanent hypothyroidism.313 (Level III) Women who have had a prior history of \nPPT, who have another autoimmune disease, or are known to be TPO-Ab-positive  \nshould be screened at 3 months for PPT with a TSH and fT4. If they are euthyroid \nand TPO-Ab-negative, no further screening is indicated. However, if they are  \nTPO-Ab-positive and euthyroid, TSH levels should be obtained at 6 and 9 months \nafter delivery.312 (Level III)\n Recommendations\n • Women with a history of autoimmune disease (T1DM, SLE etc.) should be \nscreened for postpartum thyroiditis \n • Women with a history of postpartum thyroiditis in previous pregnancies or with \npositive thyroid antibody titres should be screened for PPT \n • Women with a prior history of PPT with TPO-Ab negative should have their \nTFT checked at 3 months postpartum.

In the National \nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) from 1988 to 1994, 6.3% \nof adolescents (12–19 years of age) had positive antithyroglobulin antibodies and \n4.8% had positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. The incidence of antithyroid \nantibodies was highest in Hispanic-American adolescents and lowest in black non-\nHispanic adolescents. Non-Hispanic whites had an incidence rate between these \ntwo groups.52 (level II-2)\n7.4.1.2 What Are The Clinical Features Of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis In Children \nAnd Adolescents?\nThe most common manifestation of hypothyroidism in children is declining \nheight velocity that results in short stature which tends to be insidious in onset \nand may present for several years before other symptoms occur. Other common \nsymptoms are altered school performance, sluggishness, lethargy, cold intolerance, \nconstipation, dry skin, brittle hair, facial puffiness and muscle pain.318 (Level II-2)\nThe commonest physical finding at presentation is a diffusely enlarged thyroid \ngland/goitre in 39.5% in one series. Other physical findings are short stature; \napparent overweight; puffy facies with dull, placid expression; bradycardia; \npseudohypertrophy of the muscles and delayed deep tendon reflexes.319 (Level II-2)\nPubertal development is delayed in most patients; however, some children have \nprecocious puberty characterised by breast development and vaginal bleeding in \ngirls and macro-orchidism in boys.320 (Level II-2)\n Recommendation \n • The clinical features of hypothyroidism in children and adolescents are similar \nto adults; however, in children, evaluations of height and puberty are essential \nsince growth retardation and abnormal puberty are common",

Among all children, euthyroid goitre is more common than \nhypothyroidism.52 (Level II-2) Hashimoto’s thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis (Hashitoxicosis) \nin general has a definitive resolution of hyperthyroidism in an average of eight \nmonths.318 (Level II-2) In patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis with euthyroidism, 64.8% \nremains euthyroid after 5 years. Predictive factors for future development of \nhypothyroidism are presence of goitre, elevated TPO antibodies, ATG antibodies, \nand progressive increase in TSH.318 (Level II-2)\nAn unusual outcome of Hashimoto’s is the conversion to Graves’ disease in 7% \nof children and adolescents, which is due to alteration in the biological activity of \nthe TSH receptor antibody from predominantly a TSH receptor-blocking antibody \nduring the hypothyroid phase to a thyroid-stimulating antibody when Graves’ \ndisease manifests.318 (Level II-2)\nIn Hashimoto’s thyroiditis with subclinical hypothyroidism at the end of five-year \nfollow-up, 89.6% had thyroid dysfunction.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) is the commonest reported \nautoimmune disease in girls with TS. A study involving 41 TS girls aged 6–18 years \nconfirmed a high incidence of thyroid autoimmunity (26.8%).329 (Level II) Another \nlong-term follow-up study reported a higher incidence, whereby 42% of TS girls \nhad elevated thyroid autoantibodies.330 (Level II) Amongst the positive autoantibodies \ngroup,  65% had hypothyroidism compared to only 24% out of the total TS \npopulation, irrespective of the autoantibodies level. Hyperthyroidism was detected \nin only 2.5% of the total TS girls. The same study reported that thyroid dysfunction \nwas first noted from the age of eight years.\nAmong Asians, more than half of the Japanese women with TS in adulthood had \nthyroid autoantibodies. Of the 37 women with thyroid autoantibodies (57%), three \nhad Graves’ disease and 20 were hypothyroid and diagnosed with Hashimoto’s \nthyroiditis.331 (Level II)\nThe spontaneous evolution of thyroid function in TS girls with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis \nseems to be characterised by a significant worsening of the thyroid status, both in \nchildren presenting with euthyroidism as well as those presenting with subclinical \nhypothyroidism (SCHypo).332 (Level II) An association with TS is shown to worsen the \nlong-term prognosis of thyroid function in girls with HT.\n7.4.1.10 When To Screen For Hypothyroidism In Turner Syndrome?\nThe International Turner Syndrome Consensus Group recommends screening for \nhypothyroidism at diagnosis and then annually with fT4 and TSH measurements \nbeginning in early childhood and throughout the lifespan.333 (Level III)\nThe TS Study Group suggested that all individuals with TS should require continued \nannual monitoring of thyroid function throughout the lifespan, starting as young \nas four years of age. This is in line with the reported case of autoimmune thyroid \ndisease in a four-year–old TS patient.334 (Level III)\nAn observational study, on the other hand, suggested that thyroid function \nshould be evaluated yearly in girls with TS, past the age of eight years, and more \nfrequently in those with positive thyroid autoantibodies.330 (Level II) Some other studies \nacknowledged the importance of monitoring the thyroid function in view of the risk \nof developing hypothyroidism.329 (Level II); 331 (Level II); 335 (Level II)\nMassa et al. indicated that some TS women had goitre or biochemical hypothyroidism \neven without detectable antibodies. Therefore, they concluded that the absence \nof thyroid autoantibody did not exclude a disturbance of thyroid function.336 (Level II) \nScreening of the thyroid function of these women with TS regularly, even if they \nwere negative for thyroid autoantibody, is recommended.",

The prevalence of hypothyroidism in DS increases with age  \nand is projected as no less than 5.7% among children and adolescents in  \nScotland.337 (Level  II) Lughetti et al. reported that the probability of hypothyroidism \nincreased from 7% to 24% at ten years.338 (Level II)\nSubclinical hypothyroidism (SCHypo) is also a known thyroid dysfunction linked to \nDS. Subclinical hypothyroidism is diagnosed in asymptomatic patients with serum \nTSH concentration between 5 mIU/L and 10 mIU/L and normal free or total T4. The \nprevalence of SCHypo is even more frequently reported in children with trisomy 21, \nwith prevalence between 19.6% and 60%.339 (Level II); 340 (Level III) However, in a majority of \nthem, the thyroid function tends to normalise overtime.

There are varying studies reporting the \nprevalence of hypothyroidism in PWS that range from 4.8%348 (Level III) to as high as \n20%–30%.349 (Level IV) However, a small study looking at thyroid status in PWS patients \nup until two years of life reported that in 72.2% patients, serum TT4 and/or fT4 levels \nwere below the 2.5th percentile of the reference population.350 (Level III) This study \nsuggests that transient or definitive TSH-releasing hormone (TRH)–TSH thyroid \naxis dysfunction may frequently be present in young PWS patients. Awareness of \nthis dysfunction in this critical period of thyroid hormone action on neurological \ndevelopment is important among paediatricians.\nEvaluation of thyroid function in children with PWS, before and during GH treatment, \nwas carried out in a study of 75 PWS children. It was found that during GH treatment, \nfT4 decreased significantly to low-normal levels, while TSH levels remained  \nnormal. T3 levels were relatively high or normal, both before and during GH \ntreatment, which may indicate that PWS children have increased conversion of  \nT4 to T3.351 (Level III)\n7.4.1.17 When To Screen For Hypothyroidism In Prader–Willi Syndrome?\nAn open international multidisciplinary expert meeting held in October 2006 in \nToulouse, France, represented by 37 invited speakers had outlined recommenda-\ntions for the screening of thyroid status in PWS population. They recommended  \nthat PWS patients required screening with TSH, fT4, and fT3 measurements, especially \nbefore and while on GH treatment.352 (Level III)\nA review suggested screening for hypothyroidism to be performed within the first \nthree months of life, and then yearly, especially if on GH therapy.353 (Level III)\n Recommendations\n • Screening for hypothyroidism is recommended at diagnosis \n • Hypothyroidism in PWS may be of central or peripheral origin. Therefore, PWS \npatients require screening with TSH, fT4, and fT3 measurements before and \nwhile on GH treatment\n7.4.1.18 How To Treat And Monitor Hypothyroidism In Prader–Willi Syndrome?\nTreatment with levothyroxine at typical replacement doses based on age and  \nweight should be done if the thyroid function is indicative of hypothyroidism.352 (Level III), \n353 (Level III)",

School-aged children and adolescents could present with poor \nconcentration, deterioration in school performance, irritability, fatigue, palpitations, \nheat intolerance, fine tremor, and goitre. Younger prepubertal children more \ncommonly present with poor weight gain and frequent bowel movements and tend \nto be diagnosed later.353 (Level III); 354 (Level III) In the paediatric age group, hyperthyroidism \ncan also affect growth, puberty, and bone density.353 (Level III) Increase in height velocity \nwith advanced bone age, is related to the duration of hyperthyroidism. As in adults, \nchildren with GD may have a lower than normal bone mass; however, bone mass is \noften restored to normal levels after two years of an euthyroid state. \nThe size of the thyroid gland is variable. It is usually symmetrically enlarged, firm, \nuniformly smooth, and not tender. Ophthalmic abnormalities are usually less severe \nin children than in adults.355 (Level III) Thyrotoxicosis crisis and pretibial myxoedema are \nrare in childhood. \nA suppressed serum TSH and an elevated free T4 or T3 or both confirms the diagnosis \nof hyperthyroidism. With paediatric patients, it is important that free T4 levels are \ninterpreted according to the reference range for age. There also exists a variation in \nthe reference levels with different manufacturer assays. Some patients, especially \nprepubertal children, may have elevated serum T3, but normal free T4 levels (isolated \nT3 toxicosis).4 (Level III) In a patient with a symmetrically enlarged thyroid, recent onset \nof orbitopathy, and moderate-to–severe hyperthyroidism, the diagnosis of GD is \nlikely and further evaluation of the aetiology is often unnecessary.4 (Level III) If the \ndiagnosis is not apparent, further diagnostic tests depending on available resources \ninclude measurement of TSH-receptor antibody, determination of radioactive \niodine uptake (RAIU), or measurement of thyroid blood flow on ultrasonography \nis needed.4 (Level III) If the diagnosis of GD is unclear, TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) \nshould be measured.4 (Level III); 356 (Level III) They are sensitive and specific biomarkers for \nthe diagnosis of GD in childhood and reflect disease severity and activity.356 (Level III) \nThere is a positive correlation reported between serum TRAb and fT4 levels and \nsignificantly higher levels in young children ≤5 years of age.357 (Level II)\nMeasurement of TSH receptor antibodies may be useful in differentiating GD from \nthe toxic phase of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis.358 (Level III) \nHowever, TSH-receptor antibodies can be negative in mild or initial presentation \nof GD. A negative result may also be due to assay insensitivity. Other thyroid \nantibodies, antithyroglobulin and antithyroid peroxidases, are also often present \nbut are not specific in the diagnosis of GD. \nThyroid ultrasonography in GD usually shows a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, \noften homogeneous.

Adolescents with GD have been \nreported to present with DTC.359 (Level III) Given the debate on whether nodules found \nin the setting of autoimmune thyroid disease have an increased risk of malignancy, \na thorough evaluation of the nodule(s) is recommended. \nImaging with radioisotopes is not required for the diagnosis of GD.

First-line initial treatment is ATD, which is \ncarbimazole or its active metabolite methimazole (MMI). Propylthiouracil should \nbe avoided in children, except in selected circumstances, because of the risk \nof idiosyncratic liver failure. Methimazole/carbimazole dose typically used is  \n0.2–0.5 mg/kg daily, with a range from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily.4 (Level III);359 (Level III); \n360 (Level III) The initial starting dose is usually 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, with a maximal dose \nof 30 mg/day.361; 362 (Level III) Because most side effects of MMI are dose-related and \noccur within the first three months of treatment, high doses of MMI (>30 mg for \nan adolescent or adult) should rarely be used initially.4 (Level III); 361 (Level III); 362 (Level III) \nMethimazole/carbimazole could be administered once daily, which provides better \ncompliance.4 (Level III) Administration in divided doses has not been proven to be superior, \ncompared to once-daily dosing. However, when a more rapid biochemical control is \nneeded in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis, an initial split dose of MMI/carbimazole",

Indications for definitive \ntreatment in children include relapse after an appropriate duration of ATD, a lack \nof compliance on the part of the patient/caretakers or adverse effects of ATD. The \nissue of how long ATDs should be used in children before considering either RAI or \nsurgery is controversial. \nThe American Thyroid Association 2016 guideline recommends paediatric patients \nwith GD, who are not in remission following at least 1–2 years of MMI/carbimazole, \nbe considered for definitive treatment. Alternatively, MMI/carbimazole may also be \nused for longer duration if there are no adverse effects.4 (Level III) Patients and caretakers \nshould be counselled of the therapeutic options to make a best-informed decision. \nIn children, when ATDs are used for 1–2 years, remission rates reported are \ngenerally not high, that is, at around 20%–30% with remission defined as being \neuthyroid for one year after cessation of therapy.4 (Level I); 367 (Level II) However, a \nstudy from France had reported remission rates of 20%, 37%, 45%, and 49% \nafter 4, 6, 8, and 10 years follow-up, respectively, of 154 children treated with \nATD.368 (Level II) Thus, while definitive therapy should be considered after 1–2 years \nof MMI, treatment for longer periods is also reasonable if ATD is tolerated. \nRetrospective studies have suggested that the chance of remission after two \nyears of ATDs is low if; the thyroid gland is large (more than 2.5 times the normal \nsize for age), the child is young (<12 years), prepubertal, or not Caucasian, has \nhigh serum TRAb levels on therapy and substantially elevated free T4 levels  \n(>4 ng/dL, 50 pmol/L) at diagnosis (Table 15).359 (Level III)\nTable 15: Predictors of poor remission (Adapted from 359 [Level III])\nPredictors of poor remission for children and adolescents with Graves’ disease\nLarge thyroid gland (>2.5x the normal size for age)\nYoung age <12 years\nPrepubertal\nNon-Caucasian\nHigh serum TRAb levels\nSignificantly elevated free T4 level (>50 pmol/L) at diagnosis",

This approach is yet to be validated in  \nchildren.\n Recommendations \n • Definitive therapy available for GD is RAI or thyroidectomy \n • Indications for definitive therapy in children include relapse after an appropriate \nduration of ATD, compliance issues, or adverse effects of ATD \n • Paediatric patients who are not in remission following two years of MMI/\ncarbimazole could be considered for definitive treatment with RAI or \nthyroidectomy \n • Alternatively, MMI/carbimazole may be used for longer duration (>2 years) if \nthe hyperthyroid state is controlled with no medication side effects \n •\t Patients on prolonged ATD therapy should be re-evaluated every 6–12 months \nand when transitioning to adulthood \n7.4.2.5 What Are The Clinical Considerations For RAI Therapy?\nThe ATA 2016 guideline recommends avoiding RAI in very young children aged  \n<5 years because of concerns of increased susceptibility of the thyroid gland to the \nproliferative effects of ionising radiation.4 (Level III) It may be considered in children \nbetween five and ten years of age if the calculated RAI administered activity is \n<10 mCi (<473 MBq).4 (Level III) If RAI therapy is chosen as the treatment for GD in \nchildren, sufficient RAI should be administered in a single dose to render the patient \nhypothyroid.4 (Level III); 359 (Level III); 370 (Level III) This is due to concerns that lower administered \nactivities of RAI result in residual, partially irradiated thyroid tissue that is at an \nincreased risk for thyroid neoplasm development.\nChildren with GD having total T4 levels of >20 ng/dL (260 nmol/L) or free T4 \n>5  ng/dL (60 pmol/L) who are to receive RAI therapy should be pretreated with \nMMI/carbimazole and b-blocker, until total T4 and/or free T4 normalise before \nproceeding with the RAI treatment.4 (Level III) Although the frequency of short-term \nworsening of hyperthyroidism following pre-treatment with ATD therapy is not \nknown, there are rare reports of paediatric patients with severe hyperthyroidism \nwho have developed thyroid storm after receiving RAI.4 (Level III); 371 (Level III) When children \nreceiving MMI/carbimazole are to be treated with RAI, the medication should be \nstopped 2–3 days before treatment.4 (Level III) At that time, patients should be placed  \non beta-blockers, until total T4 and/or free T4 levels normalise following RAI \ntherapy.371 (Level III) Thyroid hormone levels in children begin to fall within the first \nweek, following RAI therapy, and usually take 2–4 months to normalise.

Attempts to minimise the RAI activity \nwill result in undertreatment and the possible need for additional RAI therapy and \nradiation exposure. The administered activity of RAI to patients with large goitres \nis high. The size of the gland may be underestimated, resulting in insufficient \nadministration of RAI activities. Therefore, surgery may be preferable to RAI in \nchildren with goitres larger than 80 g.4 (Level III) \nPhysicians at some centres administer a fixed dose to all children, whereas others \ncalculate the activity from estimation or direct measurement of gland size. To \nassess thyroid size, especially of a large gland, ultrasonography is recommended. \nThere is a lack of data comparing outcomes of fixed versus calculated activities \nin children. Advantage of calculated versus fixed dosing is that it may be possible \nto use lower administered activities of RAI and, at the same time, assure that an \nadequate administered activity is given. Radioactive iodine is excreted in saliva, \nurine, perspiration, tears, and stool. Significant radioactivity is retained within the \nthyroid for several days. It is therefore important that patients and families be \ninformed of local radiation safety recommendations. \nAfter RAI therapy, T3, T4, and/or free T4 levels should be obtained every month. \nBecause TSH levels may remain suppressed for several months after correction \nof the hyperthyroid state, TSH determinations may not be useful. Hypothyroidism \nusually develops 2–3 months following successful RAI and should be treated with \nlevothyroxine. \nSide effects of RAI therapy in children are uncommon apart from the lifelong \nhypothyroidism which is the goal of therapy. Less than 10% of children complain \nof tenderness over the thyroid in the first week after therapy, which can be \ntreated with acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for  \n24–48 hours.4(Level III) \nIf residual thyroid tissue remains in young children after RAI treatment, a theoretical \nrisk of development of thyroid cancer exists. Increased rates of thyroid cancer \nand thyroid nodules were observed in young children exposed to radiation after \nHiroshima and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion.4  (Level III); 359  (level  III) The risk \nappeared to be age-dependent, greatest for children younger than 5–6 years of age \nand decreasing progressively through 12 years of age.359 (Level III) However, these data \ndo not apply directly when assessing the risks of RAI therapy. It is also important \nto note that iodine deficiency and exposure to radionuclides other than RAI may \nhave contributed to the increased risk of thyroid cancer in young children after \nthe Chernobyl reactor explosion.359 (Level III) Thyroid cancer rates were not increased \namong 3000 children exposed to RAI from the Hanford nuclear reactor site in an \niodine-replete region.4 (Level III)",

In individuals with large thyroid glands (>80 g), the response to RAI may be \npoor and thus surgery may be preferable for these patients. When performed, a total \nor near-total thyroidectomy is the recommended procedure.4 (Level III) MMI is typically \ngiven for 1–2 months in preparation for thyroidectomy. Iodides block the release \nof thyroid hormones and reduce the vascularity of the thyroid gland. Potassium \niodine (50 mg iodide/drop) can be given as 1–2 drops (i.e. 0.05–0.1 mL) three times \ndaily for ten days before surgery. It can be mixed in juice or milk.4 (Level III)\nSurgical complication rates are higher in children than in adults. Younger children \nare at a higher risk for transient hypoparathyroidism post-thyroidectomy than \nadolescents or adults.372 (Level III); 373 (Level III); 374 (Level III) Calcium levels should be monitored \npostoperatively and treatment with calcitriol and calcium supplements may be \nneeded. Postoperative hypocalcaemia requiring intravenous calcium infusions had \nbeen reported to occur more frequently in children than in adults. Complication \nrates are reported to be two-fold higher with surgeons without extensive \nexperience.372(Level III) Further support that thyroidectomy for GD in children should \nbe performed by experienced thyroid surgeons comes from reports of institutional \nexperience showing low complication rates at high-volume centres.374 (Level III)",

Elderly patients with hyperthyroidism may present with angina pectoris \nor cardiac failure.

Any treatment for this should be individualised, gradual and closely \nmonitored. For older patients (>70–75 years), a higher treatment target of serum \nTSH (around 1–5 mIU/L) is acceptable.398 (Level III) \n8. DRUG-INDUCED THYROID DISORDERS\n8.1 AMIODARONE INDUCED THYROID DISEASE\n8.1.1 What Are The Thyroid Abnormalities Caused By Amiodarone?\nAmiodarone is a benzofuranic derivative whose structural formula closely resembles \nthat of T4. It contains approximately 37% iodine by weight. Because approximately \n10% of the molecule is deiodinated daily, and the maintenance daily dose of the drug \nranges from 200 to 600 mg, approximately 7–21 mg iodide is made available each \nday, resulting in a marked increase in urinary iodide excretion. Thus, amiodarone \ntreatment releases 50- to 100-fold excess iodine daily.411 (Level III) In an euthyroid \nperson receiving amiodarone, serum thyroxine (T4) and free T4 concentrations \nrise by 20%–40% during the first month of therapy. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) \nconcentrations decrease by up to 30% within the first few weeks of therapy. Serum \nreverse T3 concentrations increase by 20% soon after the initiation of therapy.\nThe serum TSH concentration usually rises slightly after the initiation of treatment \nand may exceed the upper limit of normal.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis may develop early, late during \namiodarone treatment, or even many months after drug withdrawal, due to the \nslow release of amiodarone and its metabolites from the body stores. Occurrence \nof AIT between 5 and 16 months after stopping amiodarone has been reported. \nThus, periodical monitoring of thyroid function is warranted even after amiodarone \ndiscontinuation.415 (Level III); 4 (Level III); 416 (Level III)\n Recommendation\n • Monitor TFT before and 3–4 months after starting amiodarone and at  \n3–6 months interval thereafter. Monitor for up to 1 year after stopping \namiodarone. \n8.1.2. What Are The Mechanisms Of Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis  \n(AIT) and How To Diagnose Them?\nAmiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may develop in patients with underlying \nthyroid abnormalities (type 1) or in patients with apparently normal thyroid \nglands (type 2).411 (Level III) This disease (AIT) is characterised by suppressed TSH \nand elevated fT4 and/or fT3 levels. Type 1 AIT (AIT 1) is a form of iodine-induced \nhyperthyroidism caused by excessive, uncontrolled biosynthesis of thyroid hormone \nby autonomously functioning thyroid tissue in response to iodine load that typically \ndevelops in persons with underlying nodular goitre or latent Graves’ disease. Type \n2 AIT (AIT 2) is a destructive thyroiditis occurring in an otherwise substantially \nnormal thyroid gland. A mixed/indefinite type is also recognised where patients \nacquire an overlapping condition of both AIT 1 and AIT 2. Out of the two, AIT 2 \nis more prevalent in iodine-sufficient areas and, in general, is the most frequent \nform of AIT.414 (Level III) Identification of the different subtypes of AIT is crucial because \nthis affects the therapeutic approach. Thyroid ultrasonography may be useful as it \nshows the presence or absence of a diffuse or a nodular goitre. Colour flow Doppler \nultrasound study of the thyroid is perhaps more reliable. In AIT 2, most cases are \ncharacterised by absent hypervascularity, whereas in AIT 1 they usually show \nan increased vascularity and blood flow velocity.414 (Level III) Nuclear imaging using \nthyroidal 131I uptake (RAIU) is another useful diagnostic tool. The results of RAIU \nare usually very low (<3%) in AIT 2 and low–normal, normal, or even increased in AIT \n1. Other tracers such as 99m pertechnetate (99mTcO4) and 99mTcO4 2-methoxy-\nisobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) have also been used.414 (Level III); 413 (Level III)",

In a  \nrandomised controlled study that compared treatment groups in AIT 2 with \nprednisolone alone, perchlorate alone and combination prednisolone and \nperchlorate, prednisolone treatment resulted in euthyroidism in all patients, while \n30% of the patients treated with sodium perchlorate alone needed additional \nprednisolone treatment to become euthyroid.417 (Level I) An earlier retrospective \nobservation showed that a six-week treatment of 42 AIT 2 patients with methimazole \nalone resulted in euthyroidism in 15% of patients compared to 76% of the \npatients treated with prednisolone alone.414 (Level III); 418 (Level III) The suggested dose of \ncorticosteroids in this setting is equivalent to 40 mg prednisolone given once daily \nfor 2–4 weeks, followed by a gradual taper over 2–3 months, based on the patient’s \nclinical response.4 (Level III)\nMixed or indefinite form of AIT: If a precise diagnosis cannot be made, two possible \napproaches can be proposed. The first one is to start with thionamides (± sodium \nperchlorate) as for AIT 1 and, in the absence of a biochemical improvement within a \nrelatively short period of time (4–6 weeks), to add glucocorticoids with the assumption \nthat a destructive component is also present superimposed on an underlying \nthyroid disorder. An alternative approach is represented by a combined treatment \n(thionamides and glucocorticoids) from the very beginning.414 (Level III)) Evidence is \nlacking on the best therapeutic strategy for mixed/indefinite AIT, and randomised \nclinical trials are warranted. One study had looked at the use of lithium in AIT but the \neffectiveness is limited and has not been confirmed.414 (Level III) Radioiodine treatment \nis usually not feasible due to the low thyroidal iodine uptake.415 (Level III) Patients \nwith AIT who fail to respond to medical therapy should be offered thyroidectomy  \nbefore they become excessively debilitated from inadequately controlled \nthyrotoxicosis.4 (Level III) A retrospective study on 24 patients who failed medical \ntherapy for AIT underwent total thyroidectomy and the outcome was improved \ncardiac function in AIT patients with severe LV dysfunction with no mortality.419 (Level III) \nThere is neither consensus nor sufficient evidence concerning the decision to either \ncontinue or stop amiodarone in AIT patients. Continuing amiodarone may increase \nthe recurrence rate of thyrotoxicosis, causing a delay in the stable restoration of \neuthyroidism and a longer exposure of the heart to thyroid hormone excess.420 (Level III) \nThe decision to continue or stop amiodarone should be individualised and taken \njointly by specialist cardiologists and endocrinologists.

Attention should be \npaid to non-specific treatment strategies and risk factors modification as mentioned \nabove.\nSodium selenite 100 mcg bd (corresponding to 93.6 mcg of elemental selenium per \nday) for 6 months has been shown to improve eye symptoms and quality of life (QoL)  \nas well as prevent the progression of GO. The effect was maintained even at 12 months  \nafter selenium was ceased at 6 months. No selenium-related side effects were \nobserved in this large multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \ntrial. However, the subjects in the study came from a marginally selenium-deficient \narea.455-456 (Level I) In long-standing, inactive mild GO, there is no evidence that selenium \nis effective.\nIn cases where objectively mild GO has a profound impact on QoL, these cases may \nbe considered as moderate-to–severe GO and offered immunosuppressive treat-\nment or rehabilitative surgery (refer to moderate-to–severe GO section).442 (Level III)\n Recommendation\n • Topical treatment and measures to control the risk factors are the mainstay of \ntreatment. A 6-month selenium supplement at a dose of 100 mcg bd can be \nconsidered \n9.5.3 Moderate-to–Severe and Active Graves’ Ophthalmopathy\nFirst-Line Treatment\nHigh dose IV glucocorticoids (GC) are currently the first line treatment for moderate-\nto–severe active GO.441-442, 457-458, 462-463 (Level I) The cumulative dose of GCs should not \nexceed 8 g.

Another 35 patients received oral prednisolone at \n0.1 g/day then tapering by 0.01 g/week with cumulative dose of 4 g in 12 weeks.  \nAt 3 months, 77% in IV group vs. 51% at the oral group showed improvement, p<0.01. \nSide effects were seen in 17% IV group versus 51% oral group, p=0.005.458 (Level I) In \nanother study, 159 subjects with active, moderate-to–severe GO were randomised to \ncumulative dose of 2.25 g (Low Dose), 4.98 g (Medium Dose) and 7.47 g (High Dose) \nof intravenous methylprednisolone in 12 weekly infusions.

Major \nadverse reaction was seen more commonly in the high-dose group. The authors \nconcluded that high dose IV methylprednisolone provides a short-term benefit over \nlow dose but with more side effects. Hence, the intermediate dose regimen should \nbe used in most cases and the high-dose regimen should be reserved for most \nsevere cases of GO.461 (Level I)\n Recommendations\n • We recommend an intermediate dose of IV methylprednisolone at 0.5 g weekly \nfor 6 weeks followed by 0.25 g weekly for 6 weeks (cumulative dose 4.5 g) in \nmost cases of moderate-to–severe GO \n • High-dose regimens of IV methylprednisolone at 0.75 g weekly for 6 weeks \nfollowed by 0.5 g weekly for 6 weeks (cumulative dose of 7.5 g) should be \nreserved for the worst cases with moderate-to–severe GO \n • We recommend that a cumulative dose of IV methylprednisolone should not \nexceed 8 g \n • We recommend assessment for viral hepatitis, liver function, cardiovascular \ndysfunction, blood glucose, and blood pressure to be undertaken before the \ncommencement of IV methylprednisolone \nSecond-Line Treatment\nA second course of IV GC if accumulative dose of 8 g methylprednisolone is not \nexceeded and patient tolerates GC well.441-442; 461-462 (Level I)\nOrbital radiotherapy can be considered, especially to improve diplopia and range \nof ductions in patients with moderate-to–severe GO.463-464 (Level I) Randomised clinical \ntrials have shown that orbital radiotherapy could potentiate the effect of systemic \nGC.465-466 (Level I) Cumulative dose of 20 Greys per orbit fractionated in 10 daily doses \ngiven over 2 weeks period is commonly used.441-442(Level II)\nCyclosporine and oral GCs: Two randomised controlled studies have shown that \nthe combination of cyclosporine and GC was more effective than either agent alone \nin patients with active, moderate-to–severe GO.467-468 (Level I) In one study, 2 groups",

Combination therapy was associated \nwith significantly better ocular outcome and lower rate of recurrences of GO.467 (Level I) \nIn another trial, prednisolone alone was better that cyclosporine alone, but the \ncombination therapy had the best response.468 (Level I) The most common adverse \nevents related to cyclosporine are dose-dependent liver and renal toxicities as well \nas gingival hyperplasia.467 (Level I)\nRituximab: There are conflicting data with rituximab, which works by its effect in \nmodulating and depleting B cell action, on GO. One small randomised controlled \ntrial in patients with active, moderate-to–severe GO showed that rituximab (2000 mg \nand 500 mg) compared to IV GC (7.5g) significantly inactivated GO (100% versus \n69%, p<0.04).

This can be repeated after a week. If the response to very high doses of \nGC is poor, then urgent decompression surgery should be considered.472-473 (Level II) \nThe predictors of poor response are presence of disc swelling at diagnosis and \npersistent active disease at 2 weeks post very high dose of IV GCs.473 (Level II)\nSevere corneal exposure should be treated aggressively with medical therapy or \nwith more invasive surgical treatment in order to prevent corneal breakdown.441 (Level I)",

If the response is absent or poor, urgent orbital \ndecompression should be done \n9.5.5 Moderate-to–Severe And Inactive Graves’ Ophthalmopathy\nAssessment to confirm inactivity of GO is important and at times can be challenging. \nIf in doubt, watchful monitoring over a period of time is needed. Rehabilitative \nsurgery should be done after the disease has been inactive for 6 months.443 (Level II) \nDifferent degrees and types or surgical intervention may be needed depending \non the amount of disfigurement and/or dysfunction that persists in the post-\ninflammatory phase.\nThere are multiple options for rehabilitative surgeries. \n1.\t Decompression surgery: Minimally invasive approach is preferred. Decompressing \nsurgery aims to reduce intraocular pressure by enlarging the bony orbit with \ndifferent degrees of extension of medial/lateral orbital walls or removal of \nthe orbital floor. Fat excision via the inferolateral or inferomedial extraconal \ncompartments is another alternative. Orbital decompression can reduce \nexophthalmos, periorbital puffiness, and lid retraction as well as reduce the \nintraocular pressure and thereby relieve retro-orbital pain. This procedure can \nalso improve strabismus and cure postural visual obscuration in patients with \norbital and optic nerve microvasculopathy. Potential complications of orbital \ndecompression are new onset/worsening strabismus and globe dystopia.474(Level II)\n2.\t Strabismus/squint surgery: It aims to restore fusion in primary position avoiding \ndiplopia in downward gaze and to correct residual incomitances.475(Level II) \n3.\t Eyelid surgery: Medical therapies such as alpha-blocker eye drops or post-\nganglia adrenergic blockers are not very effective or limited by side effects. \nBotulinum injection is effective but transient. There are many approaches to  \nlid retraction surgeries (from mild to severe degree of upper lid retraction), \nsuch as sutureless mullerectomy, transconjuctival free en block recession of \nthe levator palpebrae superioris muscle and conjunctiva, or transcutaneous \nblepharotomy.474,476(Level II)\n4.\t Cosmetic periorbital surgeries in GO are not different from those used for the \nageing-related face.474(Level II)\nIf more than one surgical procedure is needed, the sequence should be orbital \ndecompression followed by squint surgery, and lastly lid surgery.474 (Level II)",

The updated, revised section is as below; \n7.1.3  Is Maternal OH/SCHypo Associated With Adverse Maternal/  \nFoetal Outcomes?\nMaternal OH has consistently been shown to be associated with adverse \npregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, low birth weight \n(LBW), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and impaired foetal neurocognitive \ndevelopment.237 (Level II); 238 (Level II); 239 (Level II) A prospective cohort study in India \ndemonstrated more than seven times increased risk of intrauterine death while \nanother prospective cohort study in China demonstrated more than thirteen times \nincreased risk of foetal loss among pregnant women with OH compared to the \neuthyroid control.237 (Level II); 238 (Level II) \nThe associations between maternal SCHypo and adverse pregnancy outcomes have \nbeen less robust than maternal OH. This is partly due to the variable TSH cut-offs \nused in different studies and many studies did not take into account the influence \nof thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) or thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO Ab) positivity \non the outcome.240 (Level II); 241 (Level II); 242 (Level II) The adverse outcomes that were most \nconsistently reported to be associated with maternal SCHypo included pregnancy \nloss and preterm delivery.243 (Level II); 244 (Level II); 245 (Level II); 246 (Level II); Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy \n2019 (Level II)* Van den Boogard E et al. also reported an increased risk of pre-eclampsia \namong pregnant women with SCHypo while Chan et al. reported increased risk \nof placental abruption and breech presentation and Maraka et al. reported  \nincreased risk of premature ruptured of membrane (PROM) and placental abruption \nin their respective meta-analyses.243 (Level II); 244 (Level II); 245 (Level II) The association between \nimpaired intellectual development in the offspring with maternal SCHypo has been \nshown to be present in some studies but absent in others.247 (Level II); 238 (Level II); 248 (Level II) \nThe association between maternal SCHypo and adverse pregnancy outcomes were \noften exacerbated by the presence of TPO Ab.249 (Level II); 250 (Level II); 251 (Level II); 252 (Level II); 246 (Level II) \nIn a prospective cohort study involving 5971 singleton pregnancies, the association \nbetween maternal SCHypo and preterm delivery was lost after exclusion of women \nwith TPO Ab positivity or co-morbidities. However, those with high TSH (defined as \n>4.04 mIU/L) and positive TPO Ab was found to have more than three times increased \nrisk of preterm delivery.250 (Level II) A prospective cohort study in China showed that the \nincreased risk of miscarriage occurred at a lower TSH threshold among the pregnant \nwomen with concomitant SCHypo and TAI at 2.5 mIU/L compared to 5.2 mIU/L for \nwomen with isolated SCHypo without TAI.251 (Level II) Similarly, a meta-analysis on nine \ncohort studies comparing the prevalence of miscarriage among pregnant women \nwith SCHypo to the euthyroid pregnant women showed that the presence of TAI",

The risk was exacerbated in the \npresence of maternal TSH of more than 2.5 mIU/L.251 (Level II) The association between \nTPO Ab positivity and recurrent miscarriages was less robust with only two studies \nreporting an association.255 (Level II); 243 (Level II) Lower intellectual development scores \nof offspring have also been shown to be associated with TPO Ab positivity in two \nretrospective cohort studies but the evidence is weak.247 (Level II); 256 (Level II) A meta-\nanalysis of 38 studies examining clinical significance of TAI before conception and \nin early pregnancy also showed an increased risk of sub-fertility and postpartum \nthyroiditis.243 (Level II)\nSummary\n•\t\nThe presence of TAI is associated with pregnancy loss and preterm delivery \nindependent of maternal thyroid function. This is predominantly driven by the \npresence of TPO Ab positivity. \n•\t\nThe risk was exacerbated in the presence of maternal TSH of >2.5 mIU/L.\n7.1.5 Does Treatment With Levothyroxine (LT4) Improve Adverse Outcomes \nAssociated With Maternal Overt/Subclinical Hypothyroidism?\nLevothyroxine treatment for pregnant women with OH is highly recommended, \nalthough no prospective randomised control trial (RCT) has been conducted to \nprove its benefits. This is because of the numerous serious adverse maternal and",

It \nwould be unethical to withhold treatment in this population to perform an RCT. \nLT4 replacement in pregnancy is particularly essential in the first 18 to 20 weeks of \ngestation where foetal thyroid hormones depends largely on the placental transfer \nof maternal thyroxine.\nFor maternal SCHypo, the benefits of LT4 treatment are not as clear-cut as OH. \nWhile there have been many studies that demonstrated the associations of \nmaternal SCHypo with adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially pregnancy loss and \npreterm delivery, only a small number of studies demonstrated the benefits of LT4 \ntreatment in this population. A prospective, non-randomised open-labelled study \non maternal SCHypo demonstrated that the increased risk of spontaneous abortion \namong SCHypo patients not given LT4 treatment compared to controls with normal \nTSH was eliminated with LT4 treatment.257 (Level II) A retrospective study on the United \nStates national cohort demonstrated significant risk reduction in pregnancy loss \nwith LT4 treatment among pregnant women with SCHypo when the serum TSH was \nimproved to less than 4.0 mIU/L.258 (Level II) Similarly, a meta-analysis of nine cohort \nstudies showed normalisation of an increased miscarriage risk associated with \nmaternal SCHypo upon LT4 treatment compared to that of euthyroid women.246 (Level II) \nA recent randomised controlled trial showed that LT4 treatment reduced the risk \nof preterm delivery among a group of TPO Ab negative women with TSH above \n4 mIU/L.259 (Level I) However, no study has specifically assessed whether the presence \nof TPO Ab positivity will lower the serum TSH threshold in obtaining risk reduction \non miscarriage and preterm delivery.\nTwo RCTs examining the effect of LT4 replacement in maternal SCHypo or isolated \nhypothyroxinaemia had failed to show any benefits in the improvement of IQ scores \nin the offspring.260 (Level I); 261 (Level I) \n Recommendations\n • Pregnant women with OH should be treated with LT4\n • For maternal SCHypo, LT4 treatment should be considered in the following \nsituations to reduce the risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery:\n\t\na)\t\npregnant women with negative TPOAb: \n \n \n– LT4 is recommended if TSH is >10 mIU/L\n \n \n– \u0007LT4 may be considered if TSH is above the pregnancy specific reference \nrange or 4.0 mIU/L\n\t\nb)\t\npregnant women with positive TPOAb:\n \n \n– \u0007LT4 is recommended if TSH is above the pregnancy specific reference \nrange or 4.0 mIU/L\n \n \n– LT4 may be considered if TSH is >2.5 mIU/L\n • LT4 treatment is not indicated to improve the IQ scores of offsprings to mothers \nwith SCHypo",

The first prospective randomised \ncontrolled trial looking at the effect of LT4 treatment among euthyroid women with \nTAI showed significant risk reduction in miscarriage and preterm delivery with LT4 \ntreatment.262 (Level I) However, a relatively high TSH cut-off of 4.4 mIU/L was used to \ndefine euthyroid in that study. Results from subsequent retrospective studies have \nyielded mixed results.263 (Level II);264 (Level II) Another recent RCT demonstrated significant \nrisk reduction in preterm delivery but not miscarriage rate among a group of TPO \nAb positive women without overt thyroid dysfunction.265 (Level I) However, the benefits \nwere predominantly driven by those with TSH of 4 mIU/L and above. The TABLET \ntrial also failed to show any benefits in improving live birth rates among euthyroid \nwomen with positive TPO Ab associated with history of miscarriage or infertility \ndespite being commenced on LT4 before conception.Dhillon-Smith 2019* \nThe evidence available to date is therefore insufficient to recommend routine LT4 \ntreatment in euthyroid pregnant women with positive TPO Ab. \n Recommendations\n • There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine LT4 treatment in euthyroid \nwomen with positive TPO Ab in pregnancy.\n7.1.9 Who Should Be Screened for Maternal Hypothyroidism?\n Recommendations\n • The current level of evidence does not support universal screening for maternal \nhypothyroidism  \n • TSH testing should be performed for women who are trying to conceive or as \nsoon as pregnancy is confirmed if the following risk factors are present: \n\t\ni.\t\nHistory of thyroid dysfunction \n\t\nii.\t\nGoitre \n\t\niii.\t\nKnown thyroid antibody positivity\n\t\niv.\t\nAge at or above 30 years \n\t\nv.\t\nType 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disorders \n\t\nvi.\t\nHistory of recurrent pregnancy loss or preterm delivery\n\t\nvii.\t\nInfertility\n\t\nviii.\t History of thyroid surgery or head and neck radiation",
