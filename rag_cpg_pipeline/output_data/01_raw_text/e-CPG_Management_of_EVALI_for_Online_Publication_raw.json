There was active involvement from \na multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nThis is the first edition of an evidence-based CPG on the Management \nof E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI). \nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of \nSystemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans and \nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts \nin the field were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches \nwere conducted from 27 August 2020 to 1 September 2020. Literature \nsearches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG \ndevelopment process, allowing any relevant papers published before \n28 February 2021 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search \nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nThere was no relevant evidence-based CPG used as a reference in \ndeveloping the MoH CPG on EVALI. A total of seven clinical questions \nwere developed under three sections (diagnosis, treatment and referral/\nfollow-up). Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin the sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 12 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist when \napplicable, presented in evidence tables and further discussed in \nDG meetings. All statements and recommendations subsequently \nformulated were agreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence \nwas insufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the \nDG and RC. There were only a few published articles on EVALI and all \nwere of low level evidence. This CPG was developed largely based on \nthe findings of reviews and observational studies, with local practices \ntaken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of \niii",
