There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nA literature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N); Medline via Ovid, \nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and CINAHL via \nEBSCOhost (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). \nThe inclusion criteria are all literature on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) \nregardless of study design although emphasis was put for systematic \nreview. The search was limited to literature published in the last 20 \nyears, humans, “all child” (0 to 18 years) and English. In addition, the \nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to \nfurther identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted \nto identify relevant studies. In certain situations, pivotal papers beyond \nthe scope of search were used in the CPG. All searches were conducted \nfrom 23 January 2014 to 20 May 2015. Literature searches were \nrepeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development \nprocess allowing any relevant papers published before 31 August 2015 \nto be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published \nafter this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to a CPG entitled Pediatric Diabetes \ndeveloped by International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent \nDiabetes (ISPAD) in 2014. The CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal \nof Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them \nbeing used as references.\nA total of 15 main clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 24 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and",

The incidence of T1DM is very \nlow in Asia, which is approximately 2 to 5 per 100,000 person-years.1 - \n3, level II-2 In Malaysia, the incidence of T1DM was not reported by the \nMalaysian Diabetes in Children and Adolescents Registry (DiCARE) \n2006 - 2008 report due to several limitations. There were 34 sites that \nreported 408 patients to DiCARE from 2006 - 2008. Among children \nand adolescents under the age of 20 years with diabetes mellitus, \n71.8% were diagnosed with T1DM.  The median age of diagnosis was \n7.6 (IQR 4.6, 10.8) years and majority (58.3%) presented with diabetic \nketoacidosis (DKA).4, level III However, the sample size of DiCARE was \nsmall and could not represent the population. \nT1DM is a chronic disease which is associated with various complications \nincluding retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and cardiovascular \nmorbidity. Studies have shown that good glycaemic control early in the \ndisease results in lower frequency of chronic diabetes complications. In \norder to reduce health care cost due to the complications, appropriate \ntreatment should be started early. Accurate classification of diabetes \nand proper management of these children to achieve glycaemic target \nis of utmost importance. DiCARE reported a mean HbA1c of 10.8% \nreflecting poor metabolic control.4, level III \nTherefore, these clinical practice guidelines aim to provide evidence-\nbased guidance to those who are involved in the management of \nchildren and adolescents with T1DM.\n2.\t DIAGNOSIS\nTIDM is primarily due to pancreatic islet β-cell destruction leading \nto severe insulin deficiency and manifested by low or undetectable \nplasma concentration of C-peptide. Markers of the immune-mediated \nβ-cell destruction process include glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) \nantibody, insulin autoantibodies (IAA), anti-islet antibody (ICA), protein \nthyrosine phosphatase antibody (ICA512 or IA2A) and zinc transporter \n8 (ZnT8).5, level III More than 90% of patients with newly diagnosed \nT1DM have more than one of these autoantibodies. T1DM patients \nwith absence of islet β-cell antibody or so called type 1B diabetes \nhave no evidence of β-cell autoimmunity. However, patients with false \nnegative antibodies can be due to diminished titre over the course of \nthe disease.6, level III\nThe diagnosis of diabetes mellitus should be made based on the \npresence or absence of symptoms and biochemical criteria according",

The school or daycare setting also presents challenges in the \nmanagement of the patients with T1DM. The healthcare team needs \nto provide clear guidance to patients and their caregivers on how to \nmanage these special situations.\n14.1 Sick Day\nSome illnesses, especially those associated with fever, raise BG levels \nbecause of higher levels of stress hormones promoting gluconeogenesis \nand insulin resistance. Illness often increases ketone body production \ndue to inadequate insulin levels leading increased insulin requirement. \nThe increased need for insulin may persist for a few days after recovery \nfrom an illness due to insulin resistance.\nIn contrast, illness associated with vomiting and diarrhoea (e.g. \nviral gastroenteritis) may lower BG with the increased possibility of \nhypoglycaemia. Decreased food intake, poorer absorption and a slower \nemptying of the stomach or overt diarrhoea with more rapid transit \nduring gastroenteritis may contribute to such hypoglycaemia.\nHealthcare providers should provide clear guidance to patients and \ntheir caregivers on the management of diabetes during intercurrent \nillnesses. The patients and their caregivers should know the contacts \nof emergency medical service during this period. Education on sick \nday management should be given to patients and their caregivers \nperiodically to avoid complications such as DKA, dehydration, uncontrolled \nhyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia.8\nThe insulin dose usually needs to be increased when there is fever \nor intercurrent illness, based on frequent BG and urine/blood ketone \nmeasurements.8 Guidelines for insulin adjustment during sick days are \nshown in Table 6.\n•\t General Principles of Diabetes Sick Day Management:8\n1.\t DO NOT STOP INSULIN.\n2.\t Monitor BG and ketone (urine or blood) more frequently.\n3.\t Monitor and maintain electrolytes and water balance.\n4.\t Patients and their caregivers should be taught on sick day \nmanagement guidelines soon after diagnosis and periodically \nthereafter.\n5.\t Treat the underlying precipitating illness.",
