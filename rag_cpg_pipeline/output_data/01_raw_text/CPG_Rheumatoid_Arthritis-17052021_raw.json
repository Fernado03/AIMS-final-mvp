There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary \nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and \nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed \nand Guidelines International Network (G-I-N). Refer to Appendix 1 for \nExample of Search Strategy. The inclusion criteria were all patients \nwith rheumatoid arthritis regardless of study design. The search was \nlimited to literature published in the last 15 years and on humans and \nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify \nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 29 May 2017 to 2 \nJune 2017. Literature search was repeated for all clinical questions at \nthe end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers \npublished before 31 January 2019 to be included. Future CPG updates \nwill consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details \nof the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG \nSecretariat.\nReference was also made to other guidelines as listed below: \n•\t Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults: Management [National Institute for \nHealth and Clinical Excellence (NICE), July 2018]\n•\t Management of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis [Scottish Intercollegiate \nGuidelines Network (SIGN), February 2011]\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as reference.\nA total of seven main clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. \nThe DG members met 19 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.",

            "text": "1\nManagement of Rheumatoid Arthritis\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune \ndisease which primarily affects the joints. It is characterised by \nuncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue and a wide array of \nmultisystem co-morbidities. The disease has an insidious onset \nwith unpredictable and variable courses. Typically, RA manifests \nas symmetrical polyarthritis but may also present with non-specific \nsymptoms e.g. fatigue, malaise and mild fever. Bone erosion, \ndestruction of cartilage and complete loss of joint integrity can occur \nover time if treatment is delayed or inadequate. \nNumerous multicentre international studies have shown that disease \nprogression can be minimised with early and appropriate treatment. \nTreatment paradigm of RA has evolved over the last two decades with \nthe advent of biologics and implementation of treat-to-target (T2T) \nstrategy. \nThe Malaysian National Inflammatory Arthritis Registry (NIAR) reported \nthat there is often a delay in RA diagnosis as only about 50% of cases \nare diagnosed within a year of the symptom onset. This may be due to \na lack of awareness and understanding of the disease among public \nand healthcare providers. Furthermore, limited human, financial and \ninfrastructure resources may also contribute to the difficulty of accessing \nrheumatology care.4 \nThis is the first national CPG on the management of RA aimed to \nincrease awareness among healthcare providers on the importance of \nrecognizing early RA, timely referral to rheumatologist and initiation of \ntreatment. We hope that this CPG will foster close collaboration between \nvarious stakeholders in providing evidence-based management of RA \nto improve outcomes and ultimately patients’ quality of life (QoL).",

Extra-articular features may involve multiple organs \nincluding the skin, eyes, lungs and blood vessels. Non-specific systemic \nfeatures such as fever, malaise and weight loss may precede overt joint \nsymptoms. \nRA may be associated with other connective tissue diseases and chronic \nnon inflammatory pain e.g. fibromyalgia. It is also an independent risk \nfactor for cardiovascular (CV) diseases and osteoporosis.\nThe key presenting symptoms of joint inflammation are:\n•\t joint pain and swelling \n•\t early morning stiffness lasting ≥30 minutes\nThe typical articular pattern of RA is symmetrical polyarthritis affecting: \n•\t metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints\n•\t proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints\n•\t interphalangeal joint of thumbs\n•\t wrists\n•\t elbows\n•\t metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints\nThe symptoms of joint inflammation should be present for at least six \nweeks. \nFindings on physical examination include: \n•\t clinical synovitis\n joint tenderness \n boggy swelling (may be subtle in early RA) \n•\t restricted range of motion\n•\t joint deformities e.g. radial deviation of the wrist, ulnar deviation \nat the MCPs, “swan-neck” [flexion of distal interphalangeal (DIP) \njoint, hyperextension of PIP] and “boutonniere” (hyperextension of \nDIP, flexion of PIP) deformities\nDifferential diagnosis of polyarthritis should take into consideration: \n•\t duration of symptoms \n•\t pattern of joint involvement\n•\t presence of systemic features and/or other diseases\nImportant differentials include:\n•\t psoriatic arthritis\n•\t erosive inflammatory osteoarthritis\n•\t polyarticular gout\n•\t arthritis related to infection\n•\t systemic lupus erythematosus",

Combination of DMARDs are often needed to control disease \nactivity and this may pose a greater risk for AEs. Hence, an integral \npart in the management of RA include the healthcare provider’s \nunderstanding of the safety profiles of each therapy and vigilance in \nmonitoring for potential harms to patients. Nurse- and/or pharmacy-led \npatient counselling on the importance of routine laboratory tests and \nrecognition of adverse symptoms may enable early detection of drug \ntoxicity and appropriate action to be taken to minimise harm.\nAn overview of laboratory abnormalities of each drug and a summary of \ncurrent guidelines for laboratory monitoring as well as recommendation \non frequency of monitoring is provided in the Appendix 7. \n12.\t IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality \nhealthcare services based on the best and most recent available \nevidence applied to local scenario. Various factors and resource \nimplications should be considered for the success of the uptake in the \nCPG recommendations. \n12.1\t Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:\n1.\t availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and \nsoftcopies)\n2.\t conferences and updates on management of RA including \nthose involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian Society of \nRheumatology)\n3.\t Key Performance Indicator on Rheumatology Services monitored \nby MoH (i.e. screening for viral hepatitis on RA patients prior to \nstarting MTX)\n4.\t related registries - Malaysian NIAR (myNIAR) and Malaysian \nRheumatology Biologics Registry (MARBLE)\n5.\t public awareness during World Arthritis Day\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n1.\t limited awareness and knowledge in management of RA among \nhealthcare providers\n2.\t insufficient resources in RA care e.g. expertise, diagnostic tests \nand medications\n3.\t poor access to rheumatology services \n4.\t misconception on the disease and its management by the public",

This leads to pain and \nstiffness in the morning, lasting more than 30 minutes. Other \nsymptoms include redness, warmth and swelling at the joint.\n•\t RA affects joints by causing inflammation at the synovium \n(refer Figure 5). If untreated, the inflammation may damage \ncartilage and bone. \n•\t The commonly affected joints are the small joints of the hands \nand feet but other joints like shoulders, elbows, knees and \nankles may also be affected.\n•\t In some people, RA may also affect other parts of the body \nincluding the eyes, lungs and blood vessels. Other associated \nsymptoms include fatigue and mild fever.\nII.\t Causes\n•\t RA is caused by a problem in the immune system, unlike \nosteoarthritis which is usually caused by ‘wear and tear’.\n•\t The exact cause of RA is still unclear but certain factors are \nthought to increase the risk of developing it:\n\t environment - e.g. infection\n\t genes - the chance of developing RA is partly genetic\n\t hormones - women are more likely to have RA\n\t lifestyle - smoking cigarettes can double the risk of \ndeveloping RA\nIII.\tDiagnosis\n•\t There is no single test to diagnose RA. The diagnosis is made \nbased on symptoms, physical examination, x-rays and/or \nultrasound and blood tests.",

By staying active, eating well and limiting stress, overall health \ncan be optimised.\nI.\t Physical activity\n•\t It is best to rest the joint when it is acutely inflamed (painful \nand swollen).\n•\t Regular, gentle exercises can be done once inflammation \nhas resolved. This will improve joint flexibility and general \nwell-being. They include:\n\t low impact aerobic exercises e.g. line dancing, water-\naerobic\n\t strengthening exercises e.g. walking, swimming, stationary \ncycling\n\t stretching and range-of-motion exercises e.g. tai chi, yoga\nII.\t Daily tasks\nYou may need to make some adaptations to your daily tasks \nto make it safer and easier to be performed. Some examples \ninclude:\n•\t At home\n\t change door knobs to lever type \n\t replace squatting toilets with sitting toilets\n\t place regularly used items on reachable shelves \n\t replace heavy appliances with lighter ones\n•\t At work\n\t arrange the workspace to make it easier to complete tasks \nwith the least amount of physical strain\n\t take breaks from repetitive motion tasks\nIII.\t\t Healthy eating\nThere is no specific diet that improves or worsens RA. A healthy \nand well-balanced diet is important to maintain a healthy \nweight and prevent other diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus and \nheart disease. In general, a healthy dietary habit includes the \nfollowing:\n•\t consume more fresh fruits and vegetables\n•\t reduce sugar and salt\n•\t avoid processed food and high saturated fat diet\n•\t if you drink alcohol, do so in moderation; some people on \ncertain RA medications may need to avoid alcohol completely\nIV.\t\t Emotional health\nLiving with RA can be a challenge. It is normal to feel angry or \nfrustrated because tasks that used to be done routinely may \nnow be difficult. Emotional stress may make it harder to deal \nwith pain. Some steps that you can take to understand and \ncontrol your emotional health include:\n•\t avoid things that cause you stress e.g. make changes to \nyour daily routine to reduce physical strain",

These \nprinciples can help to reduce pain, inflammation and injury caused by \nexcessive stress on the joint. \nThe Principles of Joint Protection: \n1.\t Respect pain\nThere are many activity-related factors influencing the onset and \nintensity of joint pain. \nTime - the length of time one spends on an activity can influence \npain; e.g. pain resulting from five minutes of an activity may be \nmanageable, but an hour of the same task may result in pain that \nlasts for a few days.\nWeight - weight can influence pain in several ways; e.g. carrying a \nlighter bag of groceries a few times may not cause any difficulties \nbut a heavier bag can cause or worsen pain in the affected joint.\nRepetition - repetition of an activity can cause or worsen pain; \ne.g. stapling a few sheets of paper may not cause any pain, but \nrepeating this activity 50 times may cause significant pain that \nlingers for hours or days.\n2.\t Distribute the load over stronger joints and/or larger surface areas\nSmall hand joints are vulnerable to pain and inflammation when \noverused, causing overstretching of ligaments leading to instability \n(a). When possible, spread the load over several joints or to a larger \njoint (b).\n         (a)       \t \t\n\t\n                                    (b)",

Immobilisation of a joint for days or weeks can lead to \nmuscle atrophy and joint contractures. Shifting weight, stretching or \nchanging positions frequently can alleviate the pain and stiffness.\n4.\t Use good posture and body mechanics\n\t\nEach joint should be used in its most anatomically stable and \nfunctional plane. Good body mechanics and posture are important \nto minimise musculoskeletal strain, thereby preventing or reducing \npain. While it takes more energy initially, once it becomes a habit, \nless energy is needed to maintain a good posture.\n5.\t Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job\n\t\nSqueezing and pinching activities should be avoided, as they tend \nto aggravate soft tissue injury and hand deformities. Holding an \nobject with less effort, taking rest breaks and using special aids can \nreduce stress on the joint.  \n(a)\t\n\t\n\t\n                                                           (b)",
