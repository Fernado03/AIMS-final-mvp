INTRODUCTION  \n \nDental caries is a biofilm (plaque)-induced acid demineralisation \nof enamel or dentine, mediated by saliva.1 \nlevel \nIII The \ndevelopment of the carious lesion is episodic, with periods of \ndemineralisation alternating with periods of remineralisation. \n \n1.1 \nEarly Childhood Caries (ECC) \n \nDental caries in children is typically first observed clinically as a \n“white spot lesion.” If the tooth surface remains intact and non-\ncavitated, then remineralisation of the enamel is possible. If the \nsubsurface demineralisation of enamel is extensive, it \neventually causes the collapse of the overlying tooth surface, \nresulting in a “cavity”. The disease, ECC is referred to the \npresence of 1 or more decayed (non-cavitated or cavitated \nlesions), missing (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces in a \nchild under the age of 6. In children younger than 3 years of \nage, any sign of smooth surface caries is indicative of severe \nEarly Childhood Caries (S-ECC).2 level lll From ages 3 to 5, the \nseverity of ECC can be classified according to dmf scores \n(Table 1).",
