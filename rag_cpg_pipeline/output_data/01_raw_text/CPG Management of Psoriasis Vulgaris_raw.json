There was \nactive involvement of a multidisciplinary review committee (RC) during the process of \ndevelopment of this CPG.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following databases: Guidelines \nInternational Network (G-I-N); Medline via Ovid, Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic \nReviews (CDSR) and International Health Technology Assessment websites. A search \nstrategy to cover all aspects on management of psoriasis was developed in the Medline \ndatabase and adapted to other databases. Search strategies were a combination of \nMeSH and keyword searches including abbreviations (refer to Appendix 1 on an \nexample of Search Strategy). Search was restricted to human studies; literature \npublished in English language and the last ten years. If the evidence was insufficient, the \nperiod of publication was extended for another ten years. In addition, the reference lists \nof all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. \nAll searches were conducted from August 2011 till December 2012. Literature searches \nwere repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process. The \naim was to identify any further relevant papers published before 28 February 2013 to be \nincluded. Future CPG update will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The \ndetails of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other CPGs on Psoriasis such as i) Guidelines on the treatment \nof psoriasis vulgaris by the German Society of Dermatology (2012), ii) The assessment \nand management of psoriasis by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \n(NICE 2012), iii) Canadian Guidelines for the Management of Plaque Psoriasis by the \nCanadian Dermatology Association (2012), iv) Diagnosis and management of psoriasis \nand psoriatic arthritis in adults by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2010) \nand v) Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis by the \nAmerican Academy of Dermatology (2009). \nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation \n(AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. The Ministry of Health had published a \nProtocol for Biologic Intervention for Psoriasis (2011) and a Technology Review on Biologic \nfor Psoriasis (2011). This CPG incorporated recommendations from these two publications.\nA total of 25 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the \nDG were assigned individual questions within these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2) The DG \nmembers had met 21 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature \nretrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme",

INTRODUCTION\nPsoriasis is a genetically determined, systemic immune-mediated chronic inflammatory \ndisease that affects primarily the skin and joints. It has been estimated to affect 1 - 3% \nof the general population worldwide.\nPlaque psoriasis, the most common form, seen in 80 - 90% of patients, is characterized \nby sharply demarcated erythematous plaques.1- 5, level III; 6, level II-2 Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) \noccurs in up to 50% of patients with psoriasis.7, level II-2 Although not usually life-threatening, \npsoriasis can be mentally and physically disabling. Patients not only have to deal with \ntheir highly visible skin disease, they also endure physical discomfort such as tightness, \npain, bleeding and itch. Studies have shown that psoriasis causes as much disability \nas other major medical diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, \narthritis and depression.8- 9, level III \nFurthermore, several studies have shown that patients with psoriasis are more prone \nto cardiovascular disease, stroke, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.10 - 15, level \nII-2 The risk of developing these important co-morbidities such as myocardial infarction \n(MI) appears to correlate with severity of skin lesions. Young adults with severe psoriasis \nhave a 3-fold increased risk of developing MI and a reduction of 3 - 4 years in life \nexpectancy.10-11, level II-2; 14, level II-2 There is also increasing evidence that controlling chronic \ninflammation of psoriasis with systemic agents or biologics may reduce cardiovascular \nco-morbidity.12, level II-2; 15, level II-2, 16\nAlthough cure is not available, skin clearance can occur with appropriate treatment. \nUnfortunately, surveys showed that patients frequently received suboptimal care or were \non ineffective treatment for longer than neccessary.17-18, level III Hence, these guidelines are \ndeveloped to provide an evidence-based guidance to all health care providers involved \nin the care of adults with chronic plaque psoriasis. To ensure that all patients receive \nappropriate and adequate care, treatment goals and recommendations are clearly stated.\n1.1 EPIDEMIOLOGY\nPsoriasis occurs worldwide. Its prevalence varies greatly among different countries and \nranges from 0.2% in China to 4.8% in Norway.19, level II-2 A recent study using a national \nhealth insurance database documented a prevalence of 0.24% in Taiwan with a male: \nfemale ratio of 1.59:1.20, level II-2 There is no local population-based epidemiological study \non psoriasis. However, prevalence of psoriasis among Malaysian dermatology clinic \nattendees ranges from 2% to 6%.21, level III; 5, level III Studies on incidence of psoriasis are very \nrare. One study reported an annual incidence of 78.9 (95% CI 75.0 to 82.9) per 100,000 \npopulation in the United States of America (US) population and incidence is higher in \nmales (p=0.003).22, level III Another study reported an incidence rate of 14 per 10,000 \nperson-years in United Kingdom (UK) with a slightly higher rate in males after 30 years \nold.23, level II-2 Psoriasis was first diagnosed before the age of 40 in 40% of patients.22, level II-2",

Besides the \npresence of skin lesions, most patients (80%) also have associated symptom such as \nskin pain (41.7%, 95% CI 31.8 to 50) and skin discomfort (36.7%, 95% CI 29.1 to 45).24, \nlevel II-2; 1, level III The most common symptom is desquamation (68%), followed by pruritus \n(41%),1, level III; 4, level III dry skin (40%) and erythema (30%).1, level III Although embarrassment \nfrom excessive desquamation and pruritus are common complaints, there is no study \ndocumenting the extent of physical discomfort suffered by psoriasis patients in Malaysia.\nConsistent with studies from other countries,1, level III; 24, level II-2; 25, level III plaque psoriasis is \nthe commonest type of psoriasis accounting for 85.3% of the 4445 patients registered \nin Malaysian Psoriasis Registry. Other phenotypes include guttate psoriasis (4.7%), \nerythrodermic psoriasis (2.6%), pustular (1.5%) and flexural/inverse psoriasis (0.5%). \nLower limbs (81.1%) is the commonest site affected, followed by scalp (80.4%), upper \nlimbs (76.8%), trunk (73.9%), nail (59.8%) and face/neck (50.1%). The commonest nail \nabnormality is pitting (71.5%).2, level III\nThe majority of Malaysian patients (76.4%) have mild psoriasis (Body Surface Area [BSA] \n≤10%) while 23.6% have moderate-severe psoriasis (BSA >10%). PsA is present in \n16%. The commonest clinical pattern is oligo/monoarthropathy, followed by rheumatoid-\nlike symmetrical polyarthropathy, distal hand joints arthropathy, spondylitis and arthritis \nmutilans.2, level III",

Topical Corticosteroids \nA Cochrane review of observational studies on topical corticosteroids of various \npotencies showed no significant adverse event in pregnancy outcomes. However, high \npotency corticosteroids particularly on large body surface areas should be used with \ncaution because of the possibility of low birth weight baby.130, level II-2 \nc. Tar-Based preparations and Anthralin\nTar-based preparations are found to be teratogenic in animals at doses that caused \nmaternal toxicity. However there is insufficient data to enable an accurate estimate of \nteratogenic risk to be made in humans. Short-term use of topical coal tar is probably safe \nin second and third trimester of pregnancy.128, level III\nThere is no information on the use of anthralin (dithranol) during pregnancy in humans or \nanimals. Since there is no evidence of systemic absorption, dithranol is considered safe \nin pregnancy.128-129, level III\nd. Calcipotriol Analogues\nUse of calcipotriol is to be avoided in pregnancy because of systemic absorption.127-128, \nlevel III Animal studies showed increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities, incomplete \nossification of pubic bones and forelimb phalanges of foetuses.131, level III Nevertheless, use \nof topical calcipotriol during pregnancy at recommended doses (<100g/week) is unlikely \nto be associated with a high risk of teratogenicity. Although there is no published data on \nthe reproductive or teratogenic effect on humans, use beyond the recommended doses \nmay be teratogenic.129, level III\ne. Tacrolimus\nTacrolimus is effective in the treatment of facial and intertriginous psoriasis. Systemic \nabsorption of tacrolimus after topical administration is very low. Blood concentrations of \ntacrolimus in patients with atopic dermatitis treated topically are 7 to 17 times lower than \nthose observed in transplantation recipients after oral administration. Hence risk of \nteratogenicity is likely low if tacrolimus is used for limited disease although there is no \npublished human data.129, level III",

Acitretin\nAcitretin (X), a systemic retinoid, is contraindicated in pregnancy due to high risk \nof teratogenicity129, level III, 127, level III especially in first trimester128, level III The risk of fetal \nmalformation in pregnancies exposed to an oral retinoid in early pregnancy is 25.6 times \nhigher than the general population. Acitretin characteristically caused malformation \ninvolving craniofacial, cardiac, thymic, and central nervous system structures.129, level III\nPregnancy should be avoided in patients who are taking acitretin and for at least 2 years \nafter stopping treatment or longer (up to 3 years) in patients who consumed alcohol. When \nalcohol is consumed, acitretin is metabolized to etretinate, which has an elimination \nhalf-life up to 168 days. The elimination half-life of acitretin ranges from 33 to 96 \nhours.129, level III\nPrescribing acitretin to any woman of childbearing potential warrants careful consideration. \nIt is prudent to document two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests before initiating \nacitretin therapy. Patients should be advised to use two effective forms of contraception \nsimultaneously for at least 1 month before initiation of acitretin therapy, during acitretin \ntherapy, and for at least 2 - 3 years after discontinuing acitretin therapy. Patients should \nalso be advised to abstain from consuming alcohol while taking acitretin and for at least \n2 months after acitretin treatment has been discontinued.129, level III\nd. Methotrexate \nMethotrexate (X) is contraindicated in pregnancy as it is associated with increased \nrisk of spontaneous miscarriage, mental retardation and aminopterin / methotrexate \nsyndrome.129, level III Features of this syndrome are mainly skeletal abnormalities involving \nthe skull and limbs, microcephaly and hydrocephalus.134, level III Data are still insufficient to \nquantify exact threshold doses. However, based on pregnancy data from women exposed \nto methotrexate in early pregnancy, it appears that doses greater than 10mg/week are \nnecessary to produce aminopterin/methotrexate syndrome and that the critical exposure \nperiod is between 6 and 8 weeks post-conception. The effect of exposure to methotrexate \nand aminopterin on foetus during the second and third trimesters is not known.129, level III \nThe potential foetal risk when the father is exposed to methotrexate at the time of \nconception (paternal conception) remains unclear. No congenital malformation was \nobserved in small case series and case reports of pregnancies after paternal exposure \nto low-dose methotrexate.134, level III Nevertheless, because of the mutagenic potential of \nmethotrexate, both men and women are to avoid conception for at least three months \nafter taking methotrexate.128-129,level III",
