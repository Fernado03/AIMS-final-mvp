However, variations in\nthe management of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis still exist\namongst ophthalmologists in Malaysia.  This national guideline has been\ncompiled by a committee comprising of ophthalmologists, a pharmacist\nand a nursing officer from the public and private sector.  It aims to present\nevidence-based recommendations as a guide for the prophylaxis and\nmanagement of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis.\nRelevant key words ‘post-operative endophthalmitis’, ‘endophthalmitis’,\n‘endophthalmitis AND causative organism’, ‘endophthalmitis AND\nprophylaxis’, ‘endophthalmitis AND infection control’, ‘endophthalmitis AND\nclinical features’, ‘endophthalmitis AND management’ were used to generate\nliterature from the following databases (PubMed), Cochrane Database of\nSystematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews and\nCochrane Controlled Trial Register via OVID search engine.  Searches\nwere also manually done in non-indexed journals and “grey literature”.\nExisting guideline, mainly the ESCRS Guidelines on prevention,\ninvestigation and management of post-operative endophthalmitis was\nincluded as reference.  The experience and knowledge of the CPG\ndevelopment group was also considered when formulating the guideline.\nAssessment of the evidence was conducted independently by individual\nmembers and discussed as a group before decisions were made.  In each\narea considered, the best evidence available was given more weightage.\nLess well designed studies were either merely mentioned or excluded unless\nthey added a different perspective.  Related articles were selected and out\nof these, relevant articles were chosen and graded using the modified\nversion of the Catalonian Agency for Health Technology Assessment and\nResearch (CAHTAR) model.  The grading of recommendations was modified\nfrom the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN).\ni",

Its occurrence can\nlead to poor visual prognosis, and increase in health care cost.  The\nrate of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis therefore is frequently\nused as an indicator for quality assurance of ophthalmology services.\nIt is currently used as one of the national indicator approaches (NIA)\nin the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH).\n1.1 Definition\nFor practical purposes, post-operative infectious endophthalmitis\nis defined as intraocular inflammation caused by an infective\nprocess following intraocular surgery.  Intra-ocular surgery is\ndefined as any ocular surgery where the full thickness of the\ncornea and / or sclera has been breached. This definition\nexcludes patients with penetrating eye injury.\nAcute infectious endophthalmitis usually presents within two\nweeks of surgery, whereas chronic infectious endophthalmitis\nusually present a few weeks or months following surgery.\n1.2 Magnitude of Problem\nOver the past decades, the incidence of post-operative infectious\nendophthalmitis has shown a decline due to improvements in\nsurgical techniques and instrumentation. Emphasis on sterility\nand prophylactic measures may also have a role in this decline.\nThe incidence of post-operative endophthalmitis ranges from\n0.07% (1, Level 8; 2, Level 8) to 1.8% (3, Level 8).  Incidence rates differ with\nthe type of surgery.  Cataract surgery, being the most commonly\nperformed ocular surgery, is the most common type of surgery\npreceding endophthalmitis, with incidences ranging from 0.07%\nto 0.13% (4, Level 8).  The incidence following specific type of surgery\nwas : secondary intraocular lens (IOL) 0.30% to 0.40 %, extra-\ncapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with or without IOL\nimplantation 0.072% to 0.18%, phacoemulsification 0.015% to\n0.5%, penetrating keratoplasty 0.11 % to 0.18%, glaucoma\nfiltering surgery 0.06% to 1.8%, pars plana vitrectomy 0.046% to\n0.07%, combined trabeculectomy and cataract surgery 0.11%,\ncombined penetrating keratoplasty and cataract surgery 0.19%\n(4, Level 9, 5 Level 8 ).\n1",

In addition, most of\nthe studies on prophylaxis were related to cataract surgery and thus\nits application to other forms of ocular surgeries may not apply.\nAs the ocular surface is a common source of pathogens (10, Level 2; 11, Level 8)\nvarious measures have been used to prepare the ocular surface\nbefore surgery to reduce normal ocular surface flora.\n2.1 Antiseptic Measures\na.\nPreoperative povidone iodine on skin and conjunctival sac\nPovidone iodine 5% solution has been shown to decrease the\nnumber of colonies isolated from the conjunctiva by 91% and\ndecrease the number of species by 50%.  (9,  Level I; 31, Level 3; 32, Level 7; 33,\nLevel 7; 34, Level 7; 35, Level 4; 36, Level 8; 37, Level 8). Instillation of topical 5%\npovidone iodine solution into the conjunctival sac just before\nsurgery significantly reduced the incidence of culture positive\nendophthalmitis as compared to silver nitrate solution (38, Level 4; 9,\nLevel I). Even when used at 1.25% preoperatively, topical povidone\niodine has shown a significant reduction in the conjunctival\nbacterial counts (39, Level 4).\nIts application to the eye at the end of surgery has also been\nshown to be effective in reducing conjunctival bacterial flora and\nwas in fact more effective when compared to topical broad\nspectrum antibiotics (40, Level 7).\nHowever, on the basis of available clinical studies, only povidone\niodine in a concentration of 5% in balanced salt solution (BSS)\nor isotonic saline can be recommended as the preoperative\nantiseptic of choice (26, Level 9).  Chlorhexidine 0.05% should be used as\nthe alternative in patients who are allergic to povidone iodine (26, Level 9).\nThe use of povidone iodine was not associated with significant\nadverse reactions (38, Level 4).\n5",

Although some\nstudies evaluating intraocular fluid contamination have shown\nthat irrigating solution with vancomycin have reduced positive\naqueous cultures (44, Level 9; 45, Level 8; 46, Level 2), whether the reduction is\nmeaningful remains doubtful (26, Level 9).
