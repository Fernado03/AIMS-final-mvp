The quality of each retrieved evidence and its effect \nsize are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development \nGroup. In formulating the recommendations, overall balances of the \nfollowing aspects are considered in determining the strength of the \nrecommendations:-\n•\t overall quality of evidence\n•\t balance of benefits versus harms\n•\t values and preferences\n•\t resource implications\n•\t equity, feasibility and acceptability  \nLevel\n\tI\n\tII-1\n\tII-2\n\tII-3\n\tIII\n                                          Study design\nEvidence from at least one properly randomised controlled trial\nEvidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without  \nrandomisation \nEvidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control \nanalytic studies, preferably from more than one centre or\ngroup \n\tEvidence from multiple time series with or without intervention. \nDramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the \nresults of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s) \ncould also be regarded as this type of evidence\nOpinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience; \ndescriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert \ncommittees",

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review \nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platforms: Guidelines International Network \n(G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews \n(CDSR) and Pubmed. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy. The inclusion criteria are all patients with colorectal \ncarcinoma regardless of study design. The search was limited to \nliterature published in the last 20 years and on humans and in English. \nIn addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines \nwere searched and experts in the field contacted to identify relevant \nstudies. All searches were conducted from 7 May 2015 to 28 January \n2016. Literature search was repeated for all clinical questions at the \nend of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers \npublished before 30 April 2017 to be included. Future CPG updates \nwill consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details \nof the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG \nSecretariat.\nReference was also made to other guidelines as listed below: \n•\t Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) - Diagnosis and \nManagement of Colorectal Cancer (December 2011)\n•\t New Zealand Guideline Group (NZGG) - Management of Early \nColorectal Cancer (May 2011)\n•\t National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) - The \nDiagnosis and Management of Colorectal Cancer (November 2011)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to it being used as reference.\nA total of 14 clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. \nThe DG members met 23 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based",

Age-adjusted incidence rate \nwas 1.33 times higher among male than female. The incidence was \nhighest in Chinese followed by Malay and Indian. Overall mortality rate \nwas 9.8 cases per 100,000 population and age-adjusted mortality rate \nwas 1.42 times higher in male than female.2, level III\nThe most common presenting symptoms of CRC are altered bowel \nhabit (41.7%) followed by blood in stool (35.5%), abdominal pain \n(31.5%), weight loss (31.0%), anaemia (9.8%) and intestinal obstruction \n(9.3%).2, level III\nLeft-sided carcinoma is the commonest form and constitutes 81.8% of \nall notified cases. Majority of patients are at stage III and IV (54.36%) \nwhile only 8.4% are diagnosed at stage I according to the tumour-node-\nmetastasis (TNM) staging.2, level III\nThe estimated societal cost of CRC management in government \nhospitals in Malaysia using conventional chemotherapy ranges between \nRM13,622 to RM27,163 based on different stages, with an average of \nRM21,377 per patient. The cost of treatment is higher when combined \nconventional chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody is used.3 With \nincreasing number of new cases detected every year, the economic \nburden of CRC management is escalating especially if the patients \npresent in advanced stage.\nManagement of patients with CRC consists of a comprehensive strategy \nof screening, diagnosis, staging, appropriate treatment and follow-up. \nHence, this first national CPG on CRC is developed to assist healthcare \nproviders in the management of CRC.\n2.\t SCREENING AND SURVEILLANCE\n2.1\t Screening in Average Risk Population \nAverage risk population is defined as population with no known risk \nfor CRC.

Screening Intervals for CRC Based on Methods\nThe US Preventive Task Force recommends screening for CRC to start \nat the age of 50 years and continues until age 75 years. The decision to \nscreen for CRC in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be individualised, \ntaking into account the patient’s overall health and prior screening \nhistory.9, level III\n2.2\t Screening Modalities\nMost CRC arise from adenomatous polyps that progress from small \nto large polyps and later to cancer. The slow transition from polyps to \ncancers in most patients gives the window of opportunity for screening \nand early cancer detection. \nMultiple tests are available for CRC screening. Each test has its own \nstrength and weakness in the attributes of an ideal screening tool. \na.\t Faecal Tests\nFaecal test is a non-invasive tool for screening CRC in general \npopulation. It can detect presence of blood, proteins e.g. enzyme M2-\nPK and DNA.\nFaecal occult blood test (FOBT) has qualitative and quantitative testing \nmethods. In a meta-analysis of fair to high quality evidence, the pooled \nsensitivity to detect CRC was 74% (95% CI 62 to 83) for quantitative test \nmethods and 79% (95% CI 61 to 90) for qualitative test methods.9, level III\nImmunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) and guaiac-based FOBT (gFOBT) \nare two methods of qualitative FOBT. The sensitivities of iFOBT and \ngFOBT are 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.73) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.60) \nrespectively.

The treatments for colon and rectal carcinoma are \noutlined in Algorithm C and Algorithm D.\n6.1 Colon Carcinoma\na.\t Stage I and II Colon Carcinoma\nIn colon carcinoma without lymph node involvement (stage I and II), \nthe prognosis is good with surgical intervention alone. Stage II colon \ncarcinoma patients have a relatively favourable prognosis. However, \nsome patients with high risk stage II disease have a relapse rate \napproaching that of stage III colon carcinoma patients.108, level I\nIn a Cochrane systematic review of adjuvant therapy for completely \nresected stage II colon carcinoma, there was no improvement in OS \n(RRR=0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05). However, the DFS in patients who \nreceived adjuvant therapy was significantly better than without adjuvant \ntherapy (RRR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92). Most trials included in the \nreview used the combination of fluorouracil (5-FU) plus folinic acid, with \nor without levamisole.108, level I\nPrognostic indicators correlated with high risk for subsequent failure \nin stage II colon carcinoma include obstruction, poorly differentiated \ntumour, perforation, venous invasion, inadequate lymph node sampling \n(<12) or T4 disease. The benefit of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in \npatients with high risk features is not well established. The co-morbidities \nand likelihood of tolerating adjuvant systemic chemotherapy should be \nconsidered as well.108, level I Patients should be counselled carefully on \nthe risk of chemotherapy vs a potential small benefit of treatment.\nThe addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU based chemotherapy also failed \nto show benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II patients. In the \nMOSAIC trial (Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-FU/LV in \nthe Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer), six months of 5-FU/leucovorin \n(LV) was compared with six months of 5-FU/LV with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX \nregimen). There was no statistically significant improvement in five-year \nDFS and six-year OS in stage II colon carcinoma. In an exploratory \nanalysis, the probabilities of DFS at five years and OS at six years in \nhigh-risk stage II patients were also not statistically significant but there \nwas a trend toward improved DFS at five years in this group of patients \ntreated with FOLFOX4 compared with 5-FU/LV.
