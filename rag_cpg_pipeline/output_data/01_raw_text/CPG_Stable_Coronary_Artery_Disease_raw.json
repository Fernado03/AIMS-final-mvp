            "text": "2\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nThe previous clinical practice guidelines for the management \nof stable angina were issued in 2010. Since then, there have \nbeen advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the \nmanagement of this progressive disease. Therefore, it is timely \nfor the publication of this CPG, with a title that is now evolved \nfrom stable angina to that of stable coronary artery disease (SCAD).\nAtherosclerosis is a systemic vascular disease, but it is in the \ncoronary arteries where this progressive disease exerts its \nmost serious effects which can significantly affect morbidity \nand mortality.\nClinical manifestation of SCAD, by means of stable angina, has long been the point \nwhereby an individual begins to seek medical attention. However, the combination of \nearlier screening by an increasingly greater number of the general population at risk of \ncoronary artery disease has seen more patients being diagnosed with the subclinical \nSCAD. The high prevalence of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in Malaysia, \nincluding diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking, and the emergence of \nbetter diagnostic equipment have both contributed to this effect.\nIn both subclinical and clinically evident SCAD, there are now new drugs and non-drug \ninterventions available, which are now more readily available compared to when this \nlast CPG was published. In addition, new clinical evidence have emerged on these \nnew therapies. In this respect, the publication of this CPG, which reviews published \nresearch on these new therapies and strategies, is timely.\nThe management of SCAD has to be tailored carefully to an individual, as the right \ntherapeutic strategies often improves symptoms. This CPG reviews most available \ntreatment options in Malaysia and makes recommendations on strategies that can \nimprove both the patients’ clinical outcomes and quality of life.\nFinally, I would like to thank Dr Jeyamalar Rajadurai and the multidisciplinary team on \nthe expert panel who have worked hard to put this CPG together, as well as the \nexternal reviewers of this CPG. I believe this CPG will be a relevant document for \nevery practicing healthcare professional who manages patients with SCAD. \nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector General of Health Malaysia",

            "text": "10\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nRATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT\nRationale: \nCoronary Artery Disease (CAD) covers a wide spectrum from asymptomatic              \nindividuals to patients with stable CAD, Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) and \nSudden Cardiac Death (SCD). This Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on Stable \nCAD is directed at individuals:\n \n• with stable chest pain or other symptoms (e.g. dyspnea) which are known or  \n  \nsuspected to be due to CAD. \n \n• who had a previous episode of ACS but who are now stable and need regular  \n  \nfollow up and monitoring. \n \n• post revascularization by Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (CABG) or \n  \nPercutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) who are at present asymptomatic or  \n  \nhave stable symptoms due to CAD.\n \n• who are asymptomatic but are suspected or known to have CAD on non-invasive  \n  \ntesting. This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or left  \n  \nventricular (LV) dysfunction. \nThis CPG on Stable CAD has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the \nNational Heart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy \nof Medicine. It comprises cardiologists, endocrinologists, general and family \nphysicians and consultant internal medicine physicians and pharmacists from the \nPublic Health Division, government and private hospitals and the universities. This is \nthe 2nd edition of the CPG, the first being published in 2010.\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to provide guidance on:\n  the diagnosis of CAD in individuals presenting with stable chest symptoms.\n  the risk stratification of individuals who are diagnosed with CAD. This helps  \n  \ndetermine the need for revascularization guided by the patient’s preferences.\n  optimal medical therapy (OMT) in all individuals with CAD.\n  revascularization strategies.\nProcess:\nA review of current medical literature on Stable CAD for the last 10 years was \nperformed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases \n- PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.The search was conducted \nfor the period January 2006 till 31st August 2016. The following MeSH terms or free \ntext terms were used either singly or in combination:\n \n1“angina”, “stable angina”, “stable coronary artery disease”, “stable ischemic heart",

The relevant articles were carefully selected from \nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were \nsearched to identify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the \nfield were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines \nmainly that from the American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology \n(AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main \nreferences.\n \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all \nstatements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The \ngrading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted \nfrom the AHA/ACC and the ESC (pg 15).\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health \npersonnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector for review and \nfeedback.\nClinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated using the patient, \nintervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) method, addressing diagnosis, prognosis \nand management of Stable CAD.\nThe topics and subtopics were as follows:\nP: Population- Persons: \n \n \n who are asymptomatic with no previous history of CAD \n \n \n with chest pain suspected to be due to CAD\n \n \n with known CAD\n \n \n with diabetes\n \n \n with chronic kidney disease\n \n \n who are elderly\n \n \n women\n11",

This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or Left  \n  \nVentricular (LV) dysfunction. \nIt provides guidance on:\n • diagnosis of CAD in individuals presenting with stable chest symptoms.\n • risk stratification of individuals who are diagnosed with CAD. This helps  \n  \ndetermine the need for revascularization guided by the patient’s preferences.\n • optimal medical therapy in all individuals with CAD.\n • revascularization strategies.\nIndividuals with CAD, even with minimal or absent symptoms, including those \npost-revascularization, are at high risk for recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events.16-18 \nIn a large multinational registry, the 4-year rate of CV death, MI or stroke in patients \nwith stable CAD but no previous ischemic events was 12.2% and in those with \nprevious ischemic events, it was 18.3%.19 Almost 20% of individuals continue to \nhave angina one year after their MI.20 \nIn a more recent registry of patients with stable CAD who were enrolled 1-year post \nACS and managed in the contemporary era with optimal medical therapy, the \nprognosis was much better.21\nThis CPG does not address individuals who do not have CAD but who are at risk for \nCAD.

Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n • Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n • Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the  \n  above 3 criteria.\n • Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a \nprevious cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n • coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  \nepicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or \n • microvascular dysfunction.\n27",

However, there is limited  \n data on the efficacy and the role of pharmacotherapy and revascularization in  \n these patients.\n11.  FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS WITH STABLE CAD \nAll patients with Stable CAD (no change in symptoms and medications over a period \nof 1-2 years) can be discharged from the speciality cardiology clinics.\nThere are no randomized trials evaluating the impact on outcome of different \nstrategies for the follow-up of patients with stable CAD. In addition, there are currently \nno data suggesting that any form of follow up stress testing improves outcome in \nasymptomatic patients.527\nThe frequency of follow-up and further evaluation of these patients will depend on:\n• severity of CAD \n• comorbidities and optimization of risk factors\n• symptoms - particularly a change in symptoms and functional capacity\n• local resources\nClinical judgement is required in determining the need for repeated testing.",
