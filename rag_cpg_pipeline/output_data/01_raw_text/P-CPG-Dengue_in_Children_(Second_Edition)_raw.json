When \nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of \nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done \non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A \nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review \nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

This should be \nfollowed by written notification using the standard notification form.\nTreatment\n•\t All children with dengue infection who are treated as outpatient:\n\t should have daily clinical and laboratory monitoring until resolution \nof critical phase\n\t should be provided with dengue monitoring card and dengue \nhome care leaflet\n•\t Isotonic crystalloid solutions should be used in resuscitation and \nmaintenance therapy in children with dengue.\n\t Colloid solutions may be used in persistent shock despite \nresuscitation with crystalloid solutions.\n•\t Close monitoring and frequent reassessment should be done to \nguide appropriate fluid management of children with dengue shock.\n\t They should be managed by senior staff in hospitals with \npaediatricians.\n\t Those with prolonged and/or decompensated shock should be \nadmitted to the high-dependency or intensive care unit.\n•\t Blood transfusion should be given in life-threatening conditions and \ngiven as soon as severe bleeding is recognised (overt) or suspected \n(occult) in children with dengue. \n\t It must be given cautiously to avoid fluid overload especially in \nneonates or infants.\n•\t Dengue infection in infants should be managed in a hospital with \npaediatric services.\ni",

The inclusion \ncriteria are all children with suspected and confirmed dengue infection \nregardless of study design. The first search was limited to literature \npublished in the last 14 years (2004 - 2018) and on humans specifically \nchildren with unspecified age and in English. In addition, the reference \nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts \nin the field contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were \nconducted from 30 October 2018 to 7 November 2018. Literature \nsearch was repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG \ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before \n7 February 2020 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search \nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines on dengue in children \nas listed below: \n•\t Paediatric Protocols for Malaysian Hospitals (Fourth Edition)\n•\t Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue \n•\t Dengue Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and \nControl\nA total of 12 main clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. \nThe DG members met 14 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based \nlargely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical \ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.",

It is caused by dengue virus (DENV) which has four serotypes \n(DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). All serotypes are found in Malaysia \nand the predominant serotype changes from year to year.\nThe vector for DENV is a mosquito from the genus Aedes which has a \nbiting preference for certain times of the day i.e. the morning and late \nafternoon. A. aegypti is considered as the principal species as it only \nfeeds on humans and can adapt to cohabit with humans in both urban \nand rural environments. A. albopictus on the other hand is less efficient \nto spread DENV since it feeds on both human and animal blood.\nThe incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in \nrecent decades. The actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported \nand many are misclassified. World Health Organization reports a \nmodelling estimate of 390 million dengue infections per year (95% CI \n284 to 528), with 96 million (95% CI 67 to 136) manifesting clinically \n(with any severity of the disease).1, level III\nIn Malaysia, the number of dengue cases and incidence rate (IR) \ncontinues to increase with the highest number ever reported in 2019. \nIn that year, a total of 130,101 dengue cases were reported which was \nequivalent to an IR of 390.4 cases per 100,000 population.\nDuring the period 2000 - 2019, the annual number of dengue cases \nin Malaysia varied substantially, from the lowest value of 7,103 cases \n(30/100,000 population) in 2000 and reaching a peak of 120,836 \ncases (390/100,000 population) in 2015. After the peak, there was a \ndownward trend in 2016, 2017, 2018 with yearly reduction of 16.1%, \n17.3% and 3.9% of cases respectively. However, in 2019, there was an \nincrease of 61.4% in dengue cases. Refer to Figure 1.",

The \nprevious 1997 classification of DF and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) \ndrew much criticisms since the case definition of DHF was too rigid \nand not applicable in primary care or resource-limited settings. Another \nissue was that the old case definition failed to identify a significant \nproportion of dengue cases that were severe in nature involving certain \ntarget organs. Severe manifestations e.g. central nervous system \n(encephalopathy) and hepatic failure were not included in the old \ndefinition. The emphasis of the old classification was more on bleeding \nmanifestations, hence the nomenclature of DF and DHF were used. \nFindings from a multicentre study by DENCO study group led to the \nnew clinical classification.4, level II-2; 5, level III Malaysia has adopted these \nnew classifications for use in clinical management and clinical audit of \nmortality cases. New terms like dengue with/without warning signs and \nsevere dengue are used to emphasise that not only bleeding causes \nproblems in dengue but increased vascular permeability leading to \nplasma leakage can tip an in individual over to a severe form of dengue. \nRefer to Figure 3.\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nChildren\n2503\n2652\n4730\n14928\n17474\n15215\n14897\n13280\n21570\nAdult\n19884\n21897\n43346\n108698\n120836\n101357\n83849\n67335\n108531\n0\n20000\n40000\n60000\n80000\n100000\n120000\n140000\nDengue Cases",

Numerous viral, host and vector factors \nare thought to impact the risk of infection and disease severity.\nThere are four closely related but serologically distinct DENV types. \nGenerally, infection with one DENV serotype confers protection to \ninfection with that serotype only. Thus, individuals are susceptible to \nsecondary infections with other serotypes. They are at greater risk \nof severe dengue. Therefore, children and adults living in dengue \nendemic area like Malaysia where all serotypes co-circulate are at risk \nfor primary/secondary infections with any DENV.6 - 8, level III\nDengue infection in children is often difficult to differentiate from OFI \nhence often delaying appropriate management in a timely manner. \nChildren generally present with non-specific clinical features of OFI.6, level III\nAmong the different paediatric age groups, infants are at high-risk of \ngetting severe dengue.

Refer to Figure 3 for \ncommon symptoms and signs of the condition. \nDengue illness begins abruptly after an incubation period of 4 - 10 days \nfollowing the mosquito bite. It encompasses three phases as discussed \nbelow.\na.\t Febrile phase\nThis phase usually lasts 2 - 7 days. Common features include:\n•\t abrupt high-grade fever\n•\t facial flushing, skin erythema, generalised body ache, myalgia, \narthralgia, retro-orbital pain, photophobia, rubelliform exanthema \nand headache\n•\t anorexia, nausea and vomiting\nThese features are also present in OFI which might be difficult to \ndifferentiate from DF. Refer to Table 2.\nThe earliest abnormality in full blood count (FBC) is a gradual drop in \nwhite cell counts, which should alert the doctor to a high probability \nof dengue. Haematological manifestations are mild e.g. petechiae, \nmucosal membrane bleeding (nose, gum), easy bruising or bleeding at \nvenepuncture sites.10, level III\nComplications e.g. dehydration and febrile seizures may occur during \nthis phase.\nb.\t Critical phase\nThis phase usually begins after the third (or earlier) day of illness but can \nbe as late as day eight of illness. It typically occurs around the time of \ndefervescence (temperature drops to and remains below 38ºC. Plasma \nleakage may occur as a result of increased capillary permeability and \nis manifested by warning signs (refer to yellow box below).
