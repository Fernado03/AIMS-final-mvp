This condition\nIs often complicated by dental anomalles associated with typodontia\n‘Such as impacted teeth, microdontla, hypodontia of posteror teeth,\n{layed eruption and taurodontsm. It is a common problem seen by\nthe general dentist and is usualy referred to the orthodontist. though\nthere are essentially two dstinct approaches to managing this problem;\nthat is space closure or opening, these patients often manifest with\n‘many underlying skeletal and dental problems, each with ther on\nros and cons, which oftentimes poses a dilemma for the individual\n‘operator, A mult-<dscipinary team approach for a holistic management\n‘ofthis condition is therefore recommended an it's important that each\n‘member in the team understands his/her role inthe overall weatment\nplan and complement each other in thelr procedures at each stage for\n‘the best treatment outcome.\n\nProcess.\n\nEvidence was obtained by systematic review of current literature on\nCcongenitally/developmentally missing incisors using the usual electronic\n‘search engines PubMed/Medline: Cochrane Database of Systematic\nReviews; Scopus and Ovid.
