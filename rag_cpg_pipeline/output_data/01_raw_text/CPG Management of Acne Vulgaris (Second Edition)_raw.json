There was active involvement of \na multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the electronic \ndatabases mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of Systemic \nReviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines International Network \n(refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The common \nsearch was limited to literature published on humans, all adults (19 \nplus years), publications from the year “2012 to Current” and English \nlanguage. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched, and experts in the field were contacted to \nidentify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 29 May \n2020 to 10 Sep 2020. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 10 February 2022 to be included. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on acne vulgaris e.g.:\n•\t Acne Vulgaris: Management [National Institute for Health and \nCare Excellence (NICE), 2021]\n•\t Acne Management Guidelines by the Dermatological Society of \nSingapore (2019)\n•\t Guidelines of Care for the Management of Acne Vulgaris (American \nAcademy of Dermatology, 2016)\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of 14 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG \nmembers met 31 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed at each DG meeting. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the DG and \nRC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made \nby consensus of the DG and RC.

            "text": "1\nManagement of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nAcne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous \nunits, characterised by the formation of non-inflammatory (open and \nclosed comedones) and inflammatory (papules, pustules, nodules and \ncysts) lesions. Commonly affected areas are the face and trunk, and it \nusually affects adolescents and young adults. A common misconception \nby the public is that acne vulgaris is a self-limiting teenage skin problem \nand thus, does not warrant treatment. However, it has been found to \nadversely affect the patients’ social life, self-esteem and body image. \nIt also has the potential to cause scarring in some patients and may \ncontribute to significant psychological distress, like depression and \nanxiety, if left untreated.\nThe pathogenesis of acne vulgaris is multifactorial. Four key pathogenic \nfactors that play an important role in the development of acne \nvulgaris are increased sebum production, altered follicular keratinisation \nleading to comedones formation, follicular colonisation by Cutibacterium \nacnes (C. acnes), previously known as Propionibacterium acnes, \nand inflammation around pilosebaceous unit. There has been \nrecent evidence that microbiome and its interactions with the innate \nimmune system plays a factor in the development of acne\nvulgaris.1, level III In acne vulgaris, the resident microbiome includes \nC. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, whereas the transient \nmicrobiome includes Staphylococcus aureus. Microbial imbalance or \n‘dysbiosis’ has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of \ninflammatory acne. The loss of balance between the different C. acnes \nphylotypes, together with dysbiosis of the skin microbiome resulted in \nacne development, rather than C. acnes hyperproliferation.  The loss \nof diversity of C. acnes phylotypes acts as a trigger for innate immune \nsystem activation, leading to cutaneous inflammation. C. acnes \nphylotype IA1 predominance has been observed, with a more virulent \nprofile in acne than in normal skin. Recent studies also showed that the \ngut microbiome is involved in acne, through interactions with the skin \nmicrobiome.1, level III\nThe Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 evaluated the trend of acne \nvulgaris in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Globally, \nthe number of incident cases of acne vulgaris increased by 47.9% from \n79.7 million in 1990 to 117.4 million in 2019. On the other hand, the \nnumber of prevalent cases also increased globally from 156.7 million \nin 1990 to 231.2 million in 2019. The age-standardised prevalence rate \n(ASPR) of acne vulgaris was highest in the high sociodemographic \nindex region across all years from 1990 to 2019. Western Europe, high-\nincome Asia Pacific and East Asia were among the top three regions \nwith the highest ASPR in 2019 (from 41.1/1000 people to 55.8/1000 \npeople). In contrast, the regions with the lowest ASPR were Central",

The age-specific burden rate of acne vulgaris was highest in \nadolescents aged 10 - 19 years, which dropped sharply after the age \nof 20 years.2, level III\nThere is a wide variation in the prevalence of acne vulgaris among \nvarious countries, depending on the study design and patient \ncharacteristics. It is estimated that 35% to close to 100% of adolescents \nhave acne vulgaris at some point in their life.3, level III Among Asian \ncountries, the prevalence of acne vulgaris was reported to be 88% \nin Singapore adolescents aged 13 - 19 years old. Another study in \nSingapore reported higher acne prevalence among both female and \nmale secondary school students (92% - 95%). The prevalence was \nalso high at 91.4% among females aged 15 - 16 years old in Sri \nLanka. However, the prevalence was low (36.2%) in younger students \n(aged 7 - 12 years old) in South Korea. In China, the prevalence of \nacne vulgaris ranged from 51.3% - 62.7% in different population age \ngroups.3, level III Similar overall adjusted prevalence of 57.8% was found \nin an online, self-reported survey involving seven European countries \n(Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, France, Italy, Poland and \nSpain).4, level III \nThe prevalence of acne vulgaris in a Malaysian population-based study \namong adolescents aged 13 - 17 years old, which was published in \n2009, was 67.5%.5 Another recent cross-sectional study involving \nsecondary schools students reported a prevalence of acne vulgaris at \n64.7%.6, level III This concurred with two local studies among university \nstudents with a prevalence of 60.7 - 68.1%.7-8, level III \nVariation in practice in the management of acne vulgaris warrants an \nevidence-based guidelines to guide healthcare providers on the issue. \nThis is especially so when cosmeceutical products can be easily bought \nover the counter by the patients. Advancement in the diagnosis and \ntreatment in acne vulgaris necessitate related updates to be addressed \nin the new edition of the CPG. Thus, the updated version also addresses \nthe latest treatment modalities in the management of acne vulgaris. It \nis hoped that the new CPG is helpful for healthcare providers from any \nlevel of care to properly manage patients with acne vulgaris.",

Both have \nsome subjectivity involved. More objective methods for assessing the \nseverity of acne vulgaris include photography and advanced imaging \ntechnologies.19, level III\nThere are at least 25 different acne severity grading systems, \ncomprising of both global grading and lesion counting.19, level III Global \nseverity gradings are usually based on comparisons of descriptive \ntexts or photographic standards. For acne lesion counting method, the \nnumber of NIL (open and closed comedones), IL (papules, pustules \nand nodules) and total lesions (TL) are counted. Currently, there is no \nuniversally accepted grading system for acne.17\nThe South-East Asia Study Alliance (SASA) adopts the American \nAcademy of Dermatology Acne Consensus Conference (ACC) grading \nsystem for acne severity. The ACC classification of acne severity is based \non the number and types of lesions, which is further classified into three \ngroups, which are mild, moderate and severe.20 The Dermatological \nSociety of Singapore18 and the first edition of Malaysian MoH CPG \non Management of Acne5 advocate the use of Comprehensive Acne \nSeverity Scale (CASS) for evaluating acne severity. CASS [modification \nof an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of Acne Severity] is a \nvalidated tool. It correlates strongly with the Leeds technique for face \n(r=0.82), chest (r=0.85) and back (r=0.87).5 It is also simple to use in \nclinical practice.\nIn a clinical research setting, lesion counting is better suited than grading. \nCounts can distinguish between even small differences in therapeutic \nresponse. The reliability of lesion counting has been evaluated and \nshown intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.68 for NIL, 0.72 \nfor IL and 0.65 for global grading. For intra-rater reliability, the ICCs \nare 0.83, 0.79 and 0.69 for NIL, IL and global grading respectively. \nThese results suggest that lesion counting is more reliable than global \ngrading.19, level III\nRecognising the concerns with existing measures of acne severity and \ninadequate appraisals of acne severity scales to date, a review was \nconducted on original published acne scales to formally evaluate their \nquality against a set of predetermined criteria. The maximum quality \nscore was 13. The highest score of 6 was achieved by three measures, \nwhich are the Leeds Revised Acne Grading (LRAG), The Global Acne \nSeverity Scale (GEA) and The Escala de Gravedad del Acné Española \n(EGAE).

Acne and \nacne-related complications can have detrimental impacts on the QoL \nand lead to feelings of embarrassment and low self-esteem. These \ncomplications are frequently considered cosmetically unacceptable \nand can have a lasting impact on the patients. \n•\t Post-acne erythema\nPAE is a common sequelae of acne vulgaris. It clinically presents \nas telangiectasia and erythema post-acne treatment. Although PAE \nlesions may improve over time, some remain and causes undesirable \naesthetic effects to the patients.\n• Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation \nPIH is a common problem affecting acne vulgaris patients with a \nprevalence of 45.5 - 87.2%.

Due to the visibility of acne and the potential to cause scarring \nin some patients, significant psychological distress may develop if acne \nvulgaris is left untreated. \nThere are various tools available for the assessment of QoL in patients \nwith acne vulgaris, which can be divided into general and acne specific \nassessment tools. Examples of a general assessment tool is DLQI and \nacne specific tools are CADI (refer to Appendix 8) and Acne Quality of \nLife (AQOL). \n•\t Acne vulgaris can affect QoL and the assessment tools which can \nbe used are DLQI, CADI and AQOL. \na.\t Impairment of QoL\nIn a local study on mild to severe acne vulgaris patients in a dermatology \nclinic, CADI score was related to depression (p=0.012), anxiety \n(p=0.015) and stress (p=0.001).119, level III\nA cross-sectional study conducted locally in secondary schools \nassessing the perception and psychosocial impact of acne vulgaris \namong students using the CADI showed that the majority had mild \nQoL impairment based on CADI score with a mean of 3.5±2.5. \nWhen individual CADI domain with score ≥1 was analysed, 79.5% \nperceived acne as a problem, 76.4% were concerned, depressed and \nfelt miserable while 69.4% had some degree of feeling aggressive, \nfrustrated and embarrassed due to acne vulgaris.6, level III\nIn another cross-sectional study on students with mild to severe acne \nvulgaris using different tools, perceived stigma was associated with \nhealth-related QoL (p<0.001), psychological distress (p<0.001) and \nsomatic symptoms (p<0.001).120, level III\nThere is increasing evidence regarding the role of difficulties in emotion \nregulation (DER) in acne vulgaris patients, thus psychological well-\nbeing assessment is recommended. A cross-sectional study showed \nthat DER was significantly higher in acne vulgaris patients than controls. \nIt was also associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms based on \nthe Hospital Anxiety and Depressive scale (p<0.01) and impaired QoL \nbased on AQOL (p<0.01).121, level III\nIn a recent large meta-analysis of 42 observational studies, acne \nvulgaris was significantly correlated with depression (r=0.22, 95% CI",

The management of acne vulgaris should be guided by \nevidence-based approach in order to provide safe and optimum care \nfor the patients. The following are the factors that may influence the \nimplementation of the recommendations in this CPG: \n14.1\t Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing this CPG are: \ni.\t wide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to \nhealthcare providers\nii.\t annual dermatology update course for primary care doctors \nThe limiting factors in the implementation are:\ni.\t availability and cost of treatment\nii.\t variation in treatment practice and preferences\n14.2\t Potential Resource Implications\nAcne vulgaris may be seen as not important compared with other \nmedical diseases and thus not given priority in provision of medications \nas recommended by the CPG. It has to be noted that, as emphasised \nby the CPG, inadequately treated acne vulgaris may lead to various \nphysical and psychological complications that affect QoL of the patients.\nAssessment of the severity of acne vulgaris is important as it determines \nthe appropriate medications to be prescribed. The use of assessment \ntool e.g. CASS requires training to the healthcare providers. This may \ncause small resource implication. Another important issue related to \nresource implication is the availability of recommended treatment \nin the healthcare facilities. It has to be pointed out that even simple \nmedications like topical BPO which is strongly recommended in CPG is \nnot easily available in the health clinic.\nTo enhance the utilisation of this CPG on Management of Acne Vulgaris \n(Second Edition), the following clinical audit indicators for quality \nmanagement are proposed:\nPercentage of \npatients with mild \nto moderate acne \nvulgaris treated \nwith topical BPO \nas monotherapy \nor in combination \nwith other topical \ntherapy \n=\nTotal number of patients with mild to \nmoderate acne vulgaris in the same period\nNumber of patients with mild to moderate acne \nvulgaris treated with topical BPO as \nmonotherapy or in combination with other \ntopical therapy in a period\nx100%",
