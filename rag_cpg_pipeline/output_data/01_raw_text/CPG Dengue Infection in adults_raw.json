The inclusion criteria are all \nliterature on dengue infection regardless of study design. The search \nwas limited to literature published in the last five years, on humans and \nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts \nin the field were also contacted to identify relevant studies. In certain \nsituations, pivotal papers beyond the scope of search were used in the \nCPG. All searches were conducted from 26 May 2015 to 24 July 2015. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nThe previous edition of CPG (2010) was used as the basis in updating \nthese present guidelines. Reference was also made to other guidelines \non dengue infection in adults as well as handbooks from WHO such as \nDengue Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and Control \n(2009) and Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue (2012).\nA total of 18 clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions) \nThe DG members met 7 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nii",

It affects \ntropical and subtropical regions around the world, predominantly in urban \nareas. \nThe global increase of dengue incidence is also experienced by Malaysia. \nSince the year 2000, the dengue incidence in Malaysia continues to \nincrease from 32 cases per 100,000 population to 361 cases per 100,000 \npopulation in 2014 (Figure 1). The dengue incidence rate is higher in the \nage group of 15 and above. Most of the dengue cases reported were from \nurban areas (70%–80%) where factors such as high density population and \nrapid development favour dengue transmission. \nWith regards to case fatality rate, the national target is less than 0.2%. The \ncase fatality rate has been reduced from 0.6% in year 2000 to 0.2% in year \n2014 (Figure 1). Most of the dengue death has been observed to be higher \nin the age group of 15 years and above (Figure 2) and the highest has \nbeen observed in 2004.  \nFigure 1: Dengue Incidence Rate and Case Fatality Rate, Malaysia 2000-2014\nFigure 2: Dengue Case Fatality Rate (CFR) By Age Group In Malaysia, 2004-2014",

It is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. There \nare four distinct serotypes, DENV-1,2,3 and 4. Each episode of infection \ninduces a life-long protective immunity to the homologous serotype but \nconfers only partial and transient protection against other serotypes. \nSecondary infection is a major risk factor for severe dengue due to \nantibody-dependent enhancement. Other important contributing factors are \nviral virulence, host genetic background, T-cell activation, viral load and \nauto-antibodies.\nIn Malaysia, all four serotypes can be isolated at any one time. However, \na particular dengue virus serotype can predominate for at least two years \nbefore it is replaced by another serotype (Figure 3). In year 2013-2014, \nthe predominant serotype had switched twice from DENV-2 to DENV-1 in \nFebruary and June 2014 (Figure 4). \nFigure 3: Dengue Serotypes in Malaysia  (1990-2014)\nFigure 4: Dengue Serotypes in Year 2013, 2014 and 2015 (Jan-June)",

Symptomatic dengue infection \nis a systemic and dynamic disease with clinical, haematological and \nserological profiles changing from day to day. These changes accelerate \nwithin hours or even minutes during the critical phase, particularly in those \nwith plasma leakage (refer to subchapter 3.3).\nUnderstanding the systemic and dynamic nature of dengue disease as well \nas its pathophysiological changes during each phase of the disease will \nproduce a rational approach in the management of dengue infection.\n3.2   CLINICAL COURSE OF DENGUE INFECTION\nAfter the incubation period, the illness begins abruptly and will be followed \nby three phases: febrile, critical and recovery phase (refer to Figure 5).2,3\ni.      Febrile Phase\nPatients develop high grade fever suddenly and usually last 2-7 days. It \nis often accompanied by facial flushing, rash, generalised body ache, \nvomiting and headache. 2,3 Some patients may have sore throat, injected \npharynx and conjunctival injection. \nMild haemorrhagic manifestations like petechiae and mucosal membrane \nbleeding may be seen during the illness.4,5   Per vaginal bleeding may occur \nin females but rarely massive. Gastrointestinal bleeding is not uncommon.5,6 \nThe findings of tender liver are warning signs of  dengue infection.\nThe earliest abnormality in the full blood count is a progressive decrease \nin total white cell count followed by platelet reduction. This should alert the \nphysician to a high index of suspicion of dengue infection. This disease \nshould be notified as early as possible for preventive measures.\nii.     Critical Phase\nThe critical phase often occurs after third day of fever (may occur earlier) \nor around defervescence indicated by a rapid drop in temperature. This \ncoincides with an increase in capillary permeability in some patients. In \nother viral infections, the patient’s condition improves as the temperature \nsubsides, but the contrary happens in severe dengue infection wherein the \npatient may deteriorate and manifest third space plasma leakage or organ \ndysfunction.2,3,7,8",

            "text": "4\nCPG Management of Dengue Infection In Adults (Third Edition)\n2015\nThe critical phase lasts about 24-48 hours (refer to Figure 5). Varying \ncirculatory disturbances (refer to Table 1) can develop. In less severe \ncases, these changes are minimal and transient. Many of these patients \neither recover spontaneously or after a short period of fluid or electrolyte \ntherapy. In more severe forms of plasma leakage, the patients may \ndevelop compensated or decompensated shock (Table 1). Abdominal pain, \npersistent vomiting and/or diarrhoea, restlessness, altered conscious level, \nclinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed or tender liver are the clinical \nwarning signs of dengue infection with high possibility of complications.8-10 \nOrgan dysfunctions such as hepatitis, encephalitis and myocarditis usually \nbut not exclusively occur during this phase.\nIt is important to note that thrombocytopaenia and haemoconcentration are \nusually detectable in this phase. The haematocrit (HCT) level correlates \nwell with plasma volume loss and disease severity. However, interpretation \nof HCT may be difficult when there are confounding factors such as \nhaemorrhage, excessive fluid replacement or in haemodilutional state.  \nLeucopaenia with relative lymphocytosis, clotting abnormalities, elevation \nof transaminases [typically the level of aspartate aminotransaminase \n(AST) is higher than the level of alanine aminotransaminase (ALT)], \nhypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia are usually observed.2-4\niii.      Recovery/Reabsorption Phase\nAfter 24-48 hours of critical phase, usually plasma leakage stops followed \nby reabsorption of extravascular fluid. Patient’s general well being improves, \nappetite returns, gastrointestinal symptoms improve, haemodynamic status \nstabilises and diuresis ensues. Some patient may have a classical rash of \n“isles of white in the sea of red” with generalised pruritus.2 It is important to \nnote that during this phase, HCT level stabilises and drops further due to \nhaemodilution following reabsorption of extravascular fluid. The recovery of \nplatelet count is typically preceded by recovery of white cell count (WCC). \nIn some instances, organ dysfunctions may worsen (hepatitis, encephalitis \nand intracranial bleed) as the patient enters reabsorption phase.\nFigure 5 : Clinical Course of DHF 11-13",

If the hypovolaemia is not corrected promptly, the \npatient will progress to a refractory shock state.

A high index \nof suspicion and appropriate history taking, particularly with regards to a \nrecent stay in dengue hotspots or clusters of fever in neighbourhood, are \nuseful for early and accurate diagnosis of dengue infection. \nIn addition, a dengue patient may have a co-infection with another \npathogen. Diseases that may mimic dengue infection includes other viral \nillnesses. Organ dysfunction can occur in other diseases apart from dengue \ninfection and should be investigated. \n4.     DISEASE NOTIFICATION\nAll suspected dengue cases from private and public health facilities must \nbe notified by telephone/fax/e-notification to the nearest health office within \n24 hours of diagnosis, followed by written notification using the standard \nnotification format. Failure to notify is liable to be compounded under the \nPrevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act, 1988 (Act 342).25\nAny delay in notification will increase the risk of dengue transmission in \nthe locality of the residence. It is also important to update the notification if \nthere is a change in severity of dengue infection or when there is dengue \ndeath.\nNotified cases will be followed up by the health authorities for the \nverification of case definition and preventive measures. Since 2014, \nthe Ministry of Health Malaysia has set up new criteria for dengue cases \nregistration, whereby all registered dengue cases must be confirmed by \nlaboratory investigations. \n \nAll dengue deaths need to be notified as soon as possible by the treating \ndoctor in the hospital to the district health office and/or State Health \nDirector and must be investigated by District Health Officer or Epidemiology \nOfficer.26\nDengue mortality audit should be conducted within seven days after \nthe dengue death has occurred at hospital level followed by state level, \nchaired by Hospital Director and State Health Director respectively. The \ncomplete dengue death report should be sent to Communicable Diseases \nDivision, Ministry of Health within one week via State Vector Officer.

Suitable samples that can be used for testing include whole blood, \nserum and plasma.

Dengue IgM test \nThe IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the \nmost widely used serological test. The antibody titre is significantly higher \nin primary infections compared to secondary infections. Once the IgM is \ndetectable, it rises quickly and peaks at about two weeks after the onset of \nsymptoms, and it wanes to undetectable levels by 90 days. \nIn primary dengue infection, anti-dengue IgM can be detected after five \ndays of illness in approximately 80% of the cases.37,level II-2  Almost 93%-99% \nof cases will have detectable IgM from day 6 through day 10.

Recognition of shock \nin its early stage (compensated shock) and prompt fluid resuscitation will \ngive a good clinical outcome.67,level I Refer to Table 1 for details. However, \nfailure to recognise the phase of compensated shock will ultimately lead \nto decompensated (hypotensive) shock with a more complicated disease \ncourse and organ failures.\nPulse pressure of <20 mmHg and systolic pressure <90 mmHg are late \nsigns of shock in adults. \nAll patients with dengue shock should be managed in high dependency \nor intensive care units. Fluid resuscitation must be initiated promptly \nand should not be delayed while waiting for admission to ICU or high \ndependency unit. Following initial resuscitation there maybe recurrent \nepisodes of shock because capillary leakage can continue for 24-48 hours.\nIV fluid therapy is the mainstay of treatment for dengue shock. To date, \nonly four randomised controlled trials studying different types of fluid \nregime in DSS in children aged from 5-15 years are available.67-70,level I Our \nrecommendations are extrapolated from these studies. From these studies \nof colloids versus crystalloids, there is no clear advantage of using any of \nthe colloids over crystalloids in terms of the overall outcome and mortality. \n67-69, level I; 71,level I However colloid may be preferable as the fluid of choice in \npatients with intractable shock in the initial resuscitation. \nColloids seem to restore the cardiac index and reduce the level of HCT \nfaster than crystalloids in patients with intractable shock.68-69,level I The choice \nof colloids in these studies included gelatin solution and hydroxyethyl starch \n(HES) solution. In the recent meta-analysis, HES in non-dengue critically ill \npatients with sepsis was associated with an increase in the rate of renal \nreplacement therapy and coagulation abnormalities.72,level I \nColloid should be used mainly for resuscitation. Prolonged use of colloid as \nsole maintenance fluid should be avoided.

Thus, \ncompensated metabolic acidosis is an early sign of shock due to leakage \nor bleeding. Lactic acidosis due to tissue hypoxia and hypoperfusion is the \nmost common cause of metabolic acidosis in dengue shock.\nMonitoring of blood lactate levels is commonly carried out in patients \nwith severe dengue. A lactate level of <2 mmol/L in a critically ill patient \ngenerally implies that the patient has adequate tissue perfusion, although \nhigher levels are not necessarily the result of tissue hypoxia. \nCorrection of shock and adequate fluid replacement will correct the \nmetabolic acidosis. If metabolic acidosis remains uncorrected by this \nstrategy, one should suspect severe bleeding, liver failure, acute kidney \ninjury, sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, drugs (e.g. beta2 agonists, metformin) \nand hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. \nHyperchloraemia, caused by the administration of large volumes of 0.9% \nsodium chloride solution (chloride concentration of 154 mmol/L), may cause \nmetabolic acidosis with normal lactate levels and present as a normal \nanion gap metabolic acidosis. If serum chloride levels increase, change the \nfluid to balanced solution such as sterofundin or Hartmann’s.73, level III This \nimproves chloride-related acidosis.\nSodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis caused by tissue hypoxia is not \nrecommended for pH >7.10. Bicarbonate therapy is associated with sodium \nand fluid overload, an increase in lactate and pCO2 and a decrease in \nserum ionised calcium. \nA delay in lactate clearance or persistent lactate elevation is associated \nwith poor outcome. Persistent lactic acidosis contributes to myocardial \ndepression, arrhythmias, vasodilatation, increase in respiratory muscle \nworkload, reduced oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production and multi-\norgan failure.\nA likely more useful parameter for guiding therapy is lactate clearance. \nLactate clearance is calculated as follows:76\nlactate initial  -  lactate subsequent\nlactate initial\nX        100%\nA 20% clearance in two hours improves survival.\n7.5.5    Arterial blood gases\nArterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is frequently done (2-4 hourly) in patients \nwith shock mainly for detection of worsening acidosis by looking at base \nexcess, bicarbonate, CO2 and lactate. \nMixed respiratory alkalosis with metabolic acidosis (CO2 lower than \nexpected) commonly seen in liver failure, dengue encephalitis and sepsis. \nThis is seen in patients with pleural effusion and moderate ascites as they \nare tachypnoeic. \nHypoxaemia is a guide to warn us of fluid overload, pleural effusion and \ninterstitial oedema.",

Maternal Complications in Pregnant Women with Dengue Infection \nPregnant women with dengue who progress to spontaneous vaginal \ndelivery do not have additional risk of adverse outcomes. Maternal \ncomplications commonly happen when dengue infection occur during first \nand third trimester. First trimester infection is associated with abortion and \nthird trimester infection is commonly complicated with preterm birth.190,level \nIII Infection occur during labour can be associated with worse maternal \noutcomes contributed by massive bleeding due to surgical interventions \nsuch as caesarean section and operative vaginal delivery. Acute dengue \ninfection during this stage will increase the risk of foetal distress and higher \nchance of surgical interventions.189,level II-3 ;191,level III \niii.     Foetal Outcome in Pregnant Women with Dengue Infection\nDEN virus can be vertically transmitted to the foetus in utero or to the infant at \nparturition from infected symptomatic pregnant women.187,level II-3 Mothers who \nare asymptomatic have very low risk of transmission to the foetus.192,level II-3 \nClinical monitoring and laboratory investigations should be carried out for up \nto one week of life in the neonates.193,level II-3 Positive serology tests for dengue \nIgM, NS1 antigen or real-time RT-PCR to dengue in neonates confirm the \nvertical transmission.193,level II-3\nDengue infection during pregnancy may be associated with various \ncomplications, including preterm delivery (4.0%-17.9%), foetal death (8.9%-\n13.6%), low birth weight (4.0%-24.3%) and more frequent miscarriage \n(RR=3.3).188-189,level II-3;193-194,level II-3;195,level III No long term foetal abnormalities \nnoted among infants with vertical transmission.193,level II-3\niv.     Mode and Timing of Delivery\nDengue infection is not an indication for elective delivery. Majority of patients \ncan be allowed to progress to spontaneous vaginal delivery.191,level III However, \nif premature labour occurs during the acute infection, it is advisable to delay \nthe delivery until the acute infection resolves. The use of tocolytic drugs \nsuch as nifedipine and atosiban may be indicated. Close foetal monitoring \nis required in this group of patients to detect foetal distress and decision \nfor delivery can be made by the obstetrician. All pregnant mothers with \ndengue should be co-managed in hospitals by physician, anaesthetist and \nobstetrician.190,level III Deliveries in these patients should be conducted by \nobstetrician or senior medical officer (in hospital without specialist). Group \nand cross match (GXM) must be done for all dengue patients in labour. \nBlood and blood products transfusion is to be given only when indicated.\n \nInstrumental delivery should be avoided where possible and if indicated, \nthe procedures should be done by an obstetrician.190,level III When the \ndecision for instrumental delivery or operative delivery is made, the blood \nand blood products must be made available.190,level III Active management \nof third stage of labour in preventing postpartum haemorrhage is required \nby the use of IV uterotonic agent (avoid intramuscular injection). Platelets \ntransfusion is only recommended when patients have manifestation of \nbleeding, decided for caeserean section or instrumental delivery.190,level III In \nthis patient, platelets transfusion should be targeted to achieve minimum of \n50,000/ml to ensure maternal safety.190, level III",

FOOD AND SUPPLEMENTS\nFood and supplements such as Carica papaya leave juice/extract, cactus \nextract, crab or padi frog soup, bitter gourd soup, porcupine bezoar stone, \nTawa-tawa and Pegaga leaves and commercial isotonic drink have not \nbeen proven scientifically with robust evidence in preventing complications, \nexpediting the recovery or curing dengue infection. It is important to note \nthat the main problem that needs to be dealt with in dengue infection is \nthe plasma leakage and/or immune activation issues, not only about the \nlow platelet count. Manipulation of platelet count alone does not alter the \nclinical course of the disease as it is just a surrogate marker of disease \nprogression or evolution. Plasma leakage and organ dysfunction should be \nthe main focus of management.\n10.     PREVENTION OF DENGUE TRANSMISSION IN HOSPITALS\nPatients are viraemic and hence potentially infectious during the febrile \nphase.197-198,level III There are no scientific studies that address the efficacy of \nmosquito repellents or mosquito netting in reducing dengue transmission \nin hospitalised patients.

Dengue Serology (ELISA)\nDraw 3-5 ml of blood into a plain tube without anti-coagulants\ni.\t\nClot at ambient temperature\nii.\t\nDispatch to the laboratory within 4 hours of collection for serum separation \niii.\t\nby centrifugation\nNote : Haemolysed or icteric or lipaemic specimens invalidate certain test. If \nsuch specimens are received, the samples will be rejected to assure results are \nof clinical value.\n3. Viral Genome Detection (PCR)\na) Blood\nCollect 3-5 ml of blood into plain tube\ni.\t\nSend directly to virology laboratory within 2 hours of sampling. If this is \nii.\t\ndelayed, centrifuge and aliquot serum into sterile tube. Keep the sample in \na freezer at -70ºC and put in ice when sending to Virology laboratory the \nnext day\nb) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nCollect a minimum of 0.5 ml (5 drops) of CSF into sterile bijou bottle\ni.\t\nPack in ice for transport\nii.\t\nSend directly to Virology laboratory within 2 hours after being taken\niii.\t\nSend together with serum sample\niv.\t\nc) Post-mortem tissue sample\nTissue specimens should be placed in a sterile container containing either \nviral transport media (VTM) or normal saline (NS) and sent immediately to the \nlaboratory which can perform dengue real time RT-PCR. \n4. Viral Isolation\na) Blood\nDraw 3-5 ml of blood into a plain tube without anti-coagulants\ni.\t\nb) CSF\nCollect at least 1 ml of CSF specimen in a sterile plain screw-capped \ni.\t\ncontainer (universal or bijou bottle).Do not add in VTM or freeze\nPack the specimen individually in biohazard plastic bag and keep in 4ºCor \nii.\t\nin cold box with ice\nSend to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection\niii.\t\nc) Tissue or post mortem tissue\nPut the tissue in sterile container containing VTM or normal saline and \ni.\t\nscrew-capped tight. \nPacked the specimen individually in biohazard plastic bag and keep in 4ºC \nii.\t\nor in cold box with ice.\nSend to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection\niii.\t\nInform the laboratory processing the samples that the case was fatal\n•\t\nObtain a blood sample to attempt virus isolation and serology\n•\t\nObtain tissue samples for separate tests of virus isolation and \n•\t\nimmunohistochemistry",
