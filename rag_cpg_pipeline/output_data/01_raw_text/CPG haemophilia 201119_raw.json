There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review \nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA literature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of \nSystemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International \nNetwork (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The \nsearch was limited to humans and English. In addition, the reference \nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched further to \nlook for relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to \nidentify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 6 March \n2016 to 15 August 2018. Literature searches were repeated for all \nclinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing \nany relevant papers published before 31 July 2018 to be included. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were made to other CPGs on haemophilia e.g.\n•\t Guidelines for the Management of Haemophilia (World Federation \nof Haemophilia, 2012)\n•\t Guidelines for the Management of Haemophilia in Australia \n(Australian Haemophilia Centre Directors’ Organisation, 2016) \nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as references.\nA total of 17 main clinical questions were developed under three \ndifferent sections (screening, treatment and monitoring). Members of \nthe DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer \nto Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 26 times \nthroughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved \nwere appraised by at least two DG members using Critical Appraisal \nSkill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and further \ndiscussed in their meetings. All statements and recommendations \nformulated subsequently were agreed upon by both the DG and RC. \nWhere evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made \nby consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely on the \nfindings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, with \nlocal practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \niv",

            "text": "1\nManagement of Haemophilia\n1.\t INTRODUCTION \nHaemophilia is a group of inherited blood disorders in which there is \nlife-long defect in the clotting mechanism. The most common types of \nhaemophilia are haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and haemophilia \nB (factor FIX deficiency). They are inherited as X-linked recessive traits; \ntherefore, males are affected and females are carriers. Females can \nbe affected as well. In 30% of cases, no family history is obtainable \nbecause of spontaneous new mutation. The mean prevalence of \nhaemophilia A in Malaysia has increased from 5.6 per 100,000 males \nin 1998 to 6.6 per 100,000 males in 2006, with a mean of 5.9 ± 0.4 \nper 100,000 males and for haemophilia B, 1.00 ± 0.11 per 100,000 \nmales. The prevalence for the high income countries was 2.69 ± 1.61 \nper 100,000 males whereas the prevalence for the rest of the world was \n1.20 ± 1.33 per 100,000 males.1 \nThese rare disorders are complex to diagnose and manage. Persons \nwith haemophilia (PWH) are at risk of life-threatening bleeding and \nmusculoskeletal deformities if not treated properly. There are variations \nin practice among the clinicians in the management of haemophilia. The \ncost escalates when complications e.g. inhibitor development and/or \nchronic arthropathy develops. Standardising haemophilia management \nmay help contain cost while optimising clinical outcomes.\nThe haemophilia services started in the blood bank in 1980s and hence \nfor historical reasons, outpatient haemophilia care was provided by the \nblood bank and PWH referred to the haematology or paediatric wards \nwhen required. More recently, haemophilia care is being taken over \nby clinicians in line with haemophilia care internationally. In the past \ntwo decades, many advances have been made in the understanding \nof these bleeding disorders and their management. In the newly-\ndeveloped National Haemophilia Programme, the need for a local \nevidence-based CPG on haemophilia is deemed important. Therefore, \nthis document has been developed by a multidisciplinary team is \nintended to provide recommendations on the diagnosis, treatment and \nmonitoring of haemophilia and its complications.",
