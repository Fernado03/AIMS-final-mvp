There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary \nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines \nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans \nand in English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature \nand guidelines were searched further to identify relevant studies. \nExperts in the field were also contacted to identify further studies. All \nsearches were conducted from 19 Mac 2017 to 18 May 2018. Literature \nsearches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG \ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before \n31 July 2018 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence \npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can \nbe obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on diabetic foot such as:\n•\t Diabetic Foot Problems: Prevention and Management (National \nInstitute for Health and Care Excellence, 2015)\n•\t Diabetic Foot Australia guideline on footwear for people with \ndiabetes (Journal of Foot and Ankle Research, 2018)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as \nreferences.\nA total of eight clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 33 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. This \nCPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-\nanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \niv",

Around 50% of patients with diabetes die \nwithin five years of developing a foot ulcer, and up to 70% die within \nfive years after an amputation.2 It also accounts for substantial health \ncare resources. Thus, it is a major burden to the patient, carers and the \nhealthcare system.\nAccording to World Health Organization, the global prevalence of \ndiabetes among adults of >18 years of age has risen from 4.7% (108 \nmillion) in 1980 to 8.5% (422 million) in 2014.3 According to the National \nHealth and Morbidity Surveys, the prevalence of diabetes has been \nincreasing from 11.6% in 2006 to 15.2% in 2011 and further 17.5% in \n2015. The prevalence continued to increase in all age groups, from \n5.5% among the 18 - 19 years of age, and reaching its highest at 39.1% \namong the 70 - 74 years of age.4, level III Overall cost for management \nof type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2011 was RM1.40 billion \ncorresponded to 9.21% of the entire MoH budget.5, level III\nThe high prevalence of diabetes in adults increases the risk of foot \nproblems, mainly due to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease.2 Up to 50% of patients with diabetes are asymptomatic of \ndiabetic peripheral neuropathy6 and about one million amputations \nare performed on diabetic patients each year worldwide.1 Diabetic foot \nrequires careful attention and coordinated management, preferably by \na multidisciplinary foot care team. Optimal management of diabetic foot \ncan reduce the incidence of infection-related morbidities, the need and \nduration for hospitalisation, and the incidence of major limb amputation.7 \nIntensive efforts by all healthcare providers is required and guidelines \nare needed to ensure standardisation in diabetic foot care.\nThis evidence-based CPG is an updated version replacing the first \nedition of 2004. It is meant to address the main issues related to the \naspects of care for diabetic foot especially the variation in practices in \nlocal setting. This CPG will help to identify patients with diabetes at risk \nof foot complications and standardise the management in an evidence-\nbased approach.",

It accounts for up to 50% of patients.8, level III It may involve \nlarge fibre nerves (for touch, vibration, position perception and muscle \ncontrol), small fibre nerves (for thermal perception, pain and autonomic \nfunction) or both. As half of the diabetic patients with peripheral \nneuropathy are asymptomatic, screening is important to identify those \nwith diabetic foot at risk.6\nScreening for peripheral neuropathy should be performed on all patients \nwith diabetes.

Analgesics\nThe causes of pain in diabetic foot are peripheral neuropathy, ischaemia \nand infection. The treatment is similar with other painful conditions.\nFor mild to moderate pain, the WHO analgesic ladder recommends using \nsimple analgesics (e.g. paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs). Additional weak opioids (e.g. tramadol or dihydrocodeine) \nshould be considered in moderate pain. Strong opioids (e.g. morphine)\nshould be offered to patients with moderate to severe pain.44\nIn neuropathic pain, adjuvants are used at all steps of the analgesic \nladder.44 Examples of the adjuvants are antidepressant (e.g. \namitriptyline or duloxetine) and anticonvulsant (e.g. gabapentin or \npregabalin).45 Refer to Appendix 8 on Treatment of Neuropathic Pain \nin Diabetic Foot.\nb. Topical antimicrobial\nWound treatments aim to alleviate symptoms, promote healing and \navoid adverse outcomes. Topical antimicrobial therapy has been \nused on DFUs, either for treatment of clinically infected wounds or \nfor prevention of infection in uninfected wounds. There are two major \ngroups of topical antimicrobials which are discussed below. Refer to \nAppendix 9 on Types of Infections in Diabetic Foot and Suggestions \nof Treatment.\n• \nAntiseptics\nAntiseptics are a type of disinfectant that can be used on intact skin and \nsome open wounds to kill or inhibit micro-organisms.\nIodine dressing is commonly used in infected wound in the local \nsetting.

Ensure HbA1c, blood \npressure, cholesterol and weight are under control.\nDo not smoke as it restricts blood flow in the feet. Get help in smoking \ncessation if necessary.\nCheck feet every day in a brightly lit space looking at the top and \nbottom of the feet, heels, and between each toe. Check for cuts, \nblisters, redness, swelling or nail problems. Use a magnifying hand \nmirror to look at the bottom of feet or ask someone else to check it.\nKeep feet clean by washing them daily with a mild soap. Use only \nlukewarm (below 37°C) and not hot water. Do not soak feet as \nthis can cause dry skin. Dry by blotting or patting and carefully dry \nbetween the toes.\nKeep skin soft and smooth by moisturising feet but not between \nthe toes. Use a moisturiser daily to keep dry skin from itching or \ncracking over the dry areas – usually the top, the heel area and the \nsoles. Massage the cream using small circular movements. But don’t \nmoisturise between the toes which could risk an infection to occur.\nCut toenails carefully after washing and drying feet. Cut them straight \nacross and file the sharp edges. Don’t cut nails too short, as this \ncould lead to ingrown toenails.",

            "text": "43\nManagement of Diabetic Foot (Second Edition)\nNever self-treat corns or calluses. No “bathroom surgery” or \nmedicated pads. Visit your clinic for appropriate treatment.\nWear clean, dry socks that are not too tight and are light coloured. \nChange socks daily. Make sure there are no holes. Consider socks \nmade specifically for patients with diabetes with extra cushioning, \nno elastic tops, higher than the ankle and are made from fibers that \nwick moisture away from the skin. Avoid socks that have seams as \nthey can cause rubbing or irritation leading to a blister or callus.\nKeep feet warm and dry and, protect feet from hot and cold \ntemperatures. Wear shoes at the beach or on hot pavements to \nprotect feet from getting burnt. Don’t put feet into hot water. Never \nuse hot water bottles, heating pads or electric blankets as these can \ncause burns.\nNever walk barefoot indoors or outdoors. Always wear appropriate \nshoes or slippers to avoid cuts or scratches over feet. Avoid shoes \nwith narrow box, high heels, stilettos or footwear that have straps \nwith no back support. Shake out shoes and feel the inside before \nwearing. \nPut feet up when sitting. Keep the blood flowing to feet by wiggling \ntoes and moving ankles for five minutes, 2 - 3 times a day. Don’t \ncross legs for long periods of time.\n \nExercise regularly to improve circulation and balance and, reduce \nthe risk of falling. Wear athletic shoes that give support and are \nmade for specific activities.\nPeriodic foot examinations are necessary when visiting diabetes \nclinics. Get sense of feeling and pulses checked at least once a \nyear.\nSeek treatment if there is presence of calluses or ingrown toenails. \nUrgent care is needed when there is presence of pain, noticeably \nred or discoloured areas, unusually hot areas, discharges, bad \nsmell, an ulcer or blister or if feeling generally unwell with difficulty \ncontrolling sugar levels.\n \nModified: Jabatan Kesihatan WP Kuala Lumpur & Putrajaya.
