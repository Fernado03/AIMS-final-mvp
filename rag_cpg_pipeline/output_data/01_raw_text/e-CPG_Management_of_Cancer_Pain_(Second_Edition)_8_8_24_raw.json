There was active \ninvolvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee during the process \nof the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was conducted using the following \nelectronic databases/platforms: Medline via Ovid and Embase. Refer \nto Appendix 1 for an Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion \ncriteria are cancer patients with pain regardless of study design. The \nfirst search was limited to literature published in the last 13 years (2010 \nuntil 2023) for most clinical questions on humans and in English. In \naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines \nwere searched and experts in the field were contacted to identify \nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 21 February 2022 \nto 21 October 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 30 June 2023 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines on cancer pain as listed \nbelow: \n•\t World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for the Pharmacological \nand Radiotherapeutic Management of Cancer Pain in Adults and \nAdolescents 2018\n•\t Management of Cancer Pain in Adult Patients: European Society for \nMedical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines 2018\n•\t European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice \nGuidelines in Oncology - Adult Cancer Pain 2019\n•\t Use of Opioids for Adults with Pain from Cancer or Cancer Treatment: \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guideline 2023\n•\t Paediatric Pain Management Guidelines 2023 \n•\t The Children’s Hospital at Westmead Pain Management Practice \nGuideline 2021\n•\t The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Cancer Pain - \nPediatric (Age ≤18 Years) 2021\n•\t Handbook of Children’s Palliative Care Malaysia 2021\n•\t Latin-American guidelines for cancer pain management 2017\n•\t CRIS Cancer Clinical Practice Guideline for Pain Management in \nChildren with Cancer 2013",

Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG \nmembers met 24 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using \nthe Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and the review committee (RC). Where evidence was insufficient, \nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was mainly \nbased on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical \ntrials, with local practices considered.\nThe literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001) \nwhile the recommendation grading was done using GRADE principles \n(refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows strictly \nthe requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation \n(AGREE II).\nOn completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It \nwas also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from \nany interested parties.

A large \nmeta-analysis showed prevalence rates of cancer pain at 39.3% after \ncurative treatment, 55.0% during anticancer treatment and 66.4% \nin advanced, metastatic or terminal disease. Moderate to severe \npain (numerical rating scale score ≥5) was reported by 38.0% of all \npatients.4, level III This indicates that cancer pain is still prevalent despite \ntreatment and about a third of the patients suffer from more than just \nmild pain. There is no local data on the prevalence of cancer pain. \nHowever, a local study found that recognition of cancer symptoms \nwhich included pain was relatively low across Malaysia.5, level III  \nThe consumption of strong opioid analgesics (morphine, oxycodone, \nfentanyl etc.), which are essential for managing moderate to severe \ncancer pain, is relatively low in Malaysia compared with other countries. \nA recent local study found that the total strong opioid consumption \n(excluding methadone) in Malaysia was 0.086 defined daily doses \n(DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day in 2005, which increased to 0.126 \nDDD in 2014. However, this was lower than the global average of 32.8 \nDDD/1000 inhabitants/day.6, level III \nThe main barriers to effective pain control in Malaysia relate to \nphysicians’ and patients’ attitudes towards the use of opioids. In one \nsurvey among physicians, 46% felt they lacked the knowledge to \nmanage patients with severe pain, 40% were concerned about opioid \naddiction and 38% were worried about legal issues. In a survey of \npatients, 62% reported that they did not want to take opioids because \nthey believed that opioids were only for terminal cases, 54% feared \nadverse effects (AEs) e.g. constipation and nausea and 48% feared \nbecoming addicted.7, level III These misconceptions and fears may \nprevent patients from reporting their pain or requesting opioids, and \nphysicians from prescribing adequate doses or using appropriate \nroutes of administration.\nThe first edition of CPG in cancer pain management in Malaysia \nhas helped to spearhead the improvement in this field. Since then, \nservices that provide cancer pain management increased in hospital,",

Regular reassessment is vital to \nensure that treatment is effective and safe.11\nCancer pain assessment is further enhanced by the concept of Total \nPain (refer to Figure 1) which guides healthcare providers to view \nthe multidimensionality of pain.

Cancer patients experience pain \ndue to the underlying cancer or from its treatment. However, not all \npain experienced is from the cancer itself, it could sometimes be due \nto pre-existing conditions.  This emphasises the need to assess and \ndifferentiate benign causes of pain (e.g. osteoarthritis, migraine and \nosteoporosis) which may be managed differently from cancer pain.9\nList of Common Pain Syndromes:9\n•\t Nociceptive syndromes related to direct tumour involvement\n\t Base of skull metastasis\n\t Vertebral syndrome \n\t Diffuse or multifocal bone pain\n\t Pain due to neoplastic involvement of viscera e.g. liver capsular pain\n•\t Neuropathic syndromes related to direct tumour involvement\n\t Peripheral nerve syndromes\n\t Brachial and lumbosacral plexopathy\n\t Leptomeningeal metastasis\n\t Epidural spinal cord, nerve root or cauda equina compression\n•\t Syndromes related to therapy\n\t Post-operative pain syndromes such as post-thoracotomy pain\n Damage is to viscera e.g. liver, intestines, pancreas,  \n \nbladder, etc\n Character is cramping or gnawing when due to  \n \nobstruction of hollow viscus\n Character is aching, sharp or throbbing due to  \n \ntumour involvement of organ capsule\n Pain is usually diffuse and difficult to localise\n Pain may be referred to somatic structures\n Pain is due to abnormal somatosensory processing  \n \nin the peripheral or central nervous system\n Character is burning, pricking, electric-like, shooting  \n \nor stabbing, and sometimes may have a deep   \n \naching component\n Pain is usually located in the area innervated by the  \n \ncompressed/damaged peripheral nerve, plexus,  \n \nnerve root or spinal cord\n Pain is often associated with loss of sensation in  \n \nthe painful region \n Allodynia (pain due to a stimulus that does not normally  \n \nprovoke pain) or dysaesthesia (sponta-neous or  \n \ntouch-evoked unpleasant sensations), may be present\n• Visceral pain\nNeuropathic\nPain",

Pain assessment tools incorporate \nunidimensional and multidimensional measures. The most commonly \nused unidimensional assessment tools which are validated and \nadequately reliable are:\n•\t Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)\n•\t Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) \n•\t Verbal Rating Scale (VRS)\n•\t Faces Pain Scale (FPS) \nIt is crucial to determine suitable assessment tools for each patient \naccording to his/her ability to use the tools.

In the implementation of “Pain as the \n5th Vital Sign”, MoH has advocated the pain assessment tools as listed \nin Appendix 4a (MoH Pain Scale) & 4c (VRS).14\nA correlational study on various unidimensional tools [(NRS-11), Faces \nPain Scale (FPS), Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS) and a mixed scale \n(consisting of NRS-11, FPS and VDS)] in cancer patients aged ≥65 \nyears showed:15, level III\n•\t all four scales were reliable and valid for assessing cancer pain \n•\t NRS-11 had the highest test-retest reliability for current pain\n•\t VDS had the highest reliability for least pain\n•\t FPS had the highest reliability for average pain \n•\t mixed scale had the highest reliability for worst pain\nA large systematic review measured assessment tools (unidimensional \nand multidimensional) for cancer pain in adults based on psychometric \nproperties and clinical utility.

A cross-sectional study \nlooked into the predictors and common symptoms of neuropathic \ncancer pain and showed:17, level III \n•\t predictors were age <65 years old, disease duration >6 months, \nstage IV cancer, history of chemotherapy and moderate-to-severe \ncancer pain\n•\t common descriptive symptoms were tingling, electric shock, and \n‘pins and needles’\nIt is important to identify neuropathic pain using appropriate tools. \nTwo diagnostic studies looked into the accuracy of such tools. The \nfirst study on The Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and \nSigns (LANSS) scale compared pain of predominantly neuropathic \nor nociceptive origin in patients with refractory cancer-related pain. \nBased on the reference test of clinician assessment, the AUC was 0.96 \nand a specificity of 100% at a cut-off value of 12 points in detecting \nneuropathic pain.18, level I\nIn another diagnostic study on neuropathic pain in oncology patients \nusing pain specialist’s diagnosis as the gold standard, the findings \nwere:19, level III\n•\t AUC of PainDETECT and Doeleur Neuropathique en 4 (DN4) \nwere 0.870 (95% CI 0.813 to 0.926) and 0.857 (95% CI 0.799 to \n0.914) respectively",

It includes the elements of history taking, \nphysical examination, psychological and spiritual assessment. The \nuse of assessment tools during clinical encounters has the potential to \nshape the individual patient’s care in terms of experience, compliance, \nsatisfaction and improve rapport with healthcare providers. There \nare a number of available tools for comprehensive assessment e.g. \nIntegrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS), Edmonton Symptom \nAssessment System (ESAS) and Memorial Symptom Assessment \nScale (MSAS).11\nThe IPOS is valid (good internal consistency with Cronbach α  of 0.77) \nand reliable (good test-retest reliability with 60% of items having κw \n>0.60) for outcome measures, both in patient self-report and staff \nproxy-report versions.20, level III \nESAS has many modified versions. A correlational study on ESAS \nusing NRS with additional symptoms of constipation, sleep and added \ntime window of “past 24 hours” (ESAS-CS) and a version where a time \nwindow of “now” was added (ESAS-r-CS) were compared with MSAS. \nThe findings were:21, level III \n•\t ESAS-CS and ESAS-r-CS total scores correlated moderately with \ntotal MSAS (Spearman’s rho 0.62 and 0.64 respectively)\n•\t although participants preferred the ESAS-r-CS format (42.8% vs \n18.6%) because of greater clarity and understandability, the ‘‘past \n24 hours’’ time window (52.8%) was favoured over ‘‘now’’ (21.3%) \n•\t shortness of breath and nausea correlated better for the ‘‘past 24 \nhours’’ time window (0.8 and 0.72 vs 0.74 and 0.64 in ESAS-CS \nand ESAS-r-CS respectively)\n•\t the 24-hour test-retest of the ESAS-CS demonstrated acceptable \nreliability (ICC=0.69)",

The choice of analgesic \nas well as the dose and route of administration would depend on the \ntype and severity of pain. Other factors to be considered include age, \nco-morbidities and patient’s adherence. A combination of medications \nmay be used. It is essential to monitor the patient’s response to the \nmedication while minimising any AEs in achieving optimal pain control.\n4.1\t Principles of Analgesic Medicine\nWHO recommends the use of analgesic medicine should follow these \nprinciples:11 \n•\t By mouth \n\t Analgesic medication should be given by mouth whenever possible.\n•\t By the clock\n\t Doses of analgesic medication should be given at fixed intervals \naround-the-clock.\n\t The aim is for the next dose to be given before the previous dose effect \nhas worn off.\n•\t For the individual\n\t As each patient is unique and different, analgesic therapy should be \nindividualised.\n\t This is based on the type of pain, response to medication, AE etc.\n•\t Attention to detail\n\t Prescription timing should consider the patient’s day and sleep \nschedule.\n\t Education on the use of these medications should be given including \neffects and AEs. \n4.2\t World Health Organization Analgesic Ladder\nThe 3-step World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder, which \nwas introduced in 1986, remains useful as an educational tool but not \nas a strict protocol for cancer pain treatment.11 \nThe WHO analgesic ladder as shown in Figure 2 consists of three \nsteps: Step 1 for a pain score of 1 - 3 (mild), step 2 for a pain score of 4 \n- 6 (moderate) and Step 3 for a pain score of 7 - 10 (severe).

If \nnormal sensations are experienced in the non-painful site, but pain or unpleasant sensations (tingling, nausea) are \nexperienced in the painful area when stroking, allodynia is present. \na)\t\nNO, normal sensation in both areas……………………………………...…………….(0)\nb)\t\nYES, allodynia in painful area only……………………………………………………..(5)\n2)\t\nALTERED PIN-PRICK THRESHOLD\nDetermine the pin-prick threshold by comparing the response to a 23 gauge (blue) needle mounted inside a 2 ml \nsyringe barrel placed gently on to the skin in a non-painful and then painful areas. \nIf a sharp pin-prink is felt in the non-painful area, but a different sensation is experienced in the painful area e.g. \nnone/blunt only (raised PPT) or a vary painful sensation (lowered PPT), an altered PPT is present. \nIf a pin-prick is not felt in either area, mount the syringe onto the needle to increase the weight and repeat. \na)\t\nNO, equal sensation in both areas……………..……………………………………….(0)\nb)\t\nYES, altered PPT in painful area………………………………………………………..(3)\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\t\nSCORING: \nAdd values in parentheses for sensory description and examination finding to obtain overall score. \nTOTAL SCORE (maximum 24)…………………………………………………………………\nIf score <12, neuropathic mechanisms are unlikely to be contributing to the patient’s pain \nIf score >12, neuropathic mechanisms are likely to be contributing to the patient’s pain\nThe LANSS identifies patients with neuropathic pain by combining the score of a patient’s verbal description of pain \nand the results of neurological examination. This tool has two parts-a patient completed section and a brief physical \nassessment. Five questions in the patient-completed section (maximum score 16) identify those who are experiencing \nphenomena associated with neuropathic pain: ‘pins and needles’ (paraesthesia); ‘red skin’ (autonomic changes); \n‘sensitive skin’ (evoked dysaesthesia); ‘electric shock pain’; and ‘burning pain’ (spontaneous dysaesthesia). The \nphysical assessment (maximum score 8) is designed to identify allodynia by stroking cotton wool over the painful and \nthe anatomically equivalent non-painful area, and altered pinprick threshold (PPT) by use of a 23-gauge needle to \nassess perception of pinprick in the same areas.\nAdapted:  The LANSS Pain Scale",

Use only water to wash the skin. Do not apply soap, cream, \noil or ointment on the area.\n•\t\nDo NOT apply the patch over your Totally Implantable Venous \nCatheter (e.g. chemoport)/over a joint area/on irradiated skin.\n•\t\nBody hair should be clipped with scissors IF necessary and NOT \nshaved.\nStep 2: Preparation of patch\n•\t\nEach patch is sealed in its own sachet. Tear or cut open the sachet \nat the notch/arrow. Do NOT cut across the middle of the sachet.\nStep 3: Method of administration\n•\t\nPeel one half of the plastic backing away from the centre of the \npatch. Try not to touch the sticky side of the patch. Press the sticky \npart of the patch onto the skin. \n•\t\nRemove the other half of the plastic backing and press the whole \npatch onto the skin. Hold for 30 seconds. Make sure it sticks well, \nespecially the edges.\n•\t\nChange the patch every 72 hours. Remove the old patch before \napplying a new one. The date and time of patch due change should \nbe written on the patch.\n•\t\nDo NOT apply the patch on the same place twice in a row. Change \nthe site of application to allow the skin to rest.\n•\t\nIf you need to apply more than one patch at a time, place the \npatches adequately apart so that the edges do not touch or overlap \neach other.\n•\t\nIf the patch falls off/peels off before the date and time of due \nchange, apply a new patch on a new area of skin.\nStep 3: Disposal of used patch\n•\t\nFold used patch in half with the adhesive side inwards.\n•\t\nDiscard in clinical waste bin (in the hospital) or in a waste bin at \nhome and wash your hands. \nAdapted: HKL Counseling Checklist (Oct 2020) and Hosp Selayang Palliative Unit \nInformation Leaflet (Administration of Transdermal Fentanyl Patch).",
