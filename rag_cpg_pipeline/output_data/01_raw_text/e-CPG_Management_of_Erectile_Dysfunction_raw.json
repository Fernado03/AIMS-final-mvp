The guideline should not override the responsibility of \nthe practitioners to make decision appropriate to the circumstances of \nthe individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and \ntheir families or guardians, taking into account the management options \navailable locally. \nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2024 and will be reviewed in a minimum \nperiod of four years (2028) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When \nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of \nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done \non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A \nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review \nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

There \nwas active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) \nduring the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and others \ne.g. PubMed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). \nThe inclusion criteria are all adults at risk and with erectile dysfunction \n(ED) regardless of study design. The ﬁrst search was limited to \nliterature published in the last 15 years (2007 until 2022) for all clinical \nquestions, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of \nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify \nrelevant studies. Experts in the ﬁeld were also contacted for studies \nrelated to the issues addressed. All searches were conducted from 2 \nto 17 August 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 9 January 2024 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat. \nReferences were also made to other guidelines on ED as listed below: \n•\t American Urological Association (AUA) - Erectile Dysfunction: AUA \nGuideline (2018)\n•\t European Association of Urology (EAU) - EAU Guidelines on \nSexual and Reproductive Health (2023)\nA total of 12 main clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within \nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG \nmembers met 21 times throughout the development of these guidelines. \nAll literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using \nthe Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence \ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufﬁcient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion \nare resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely on the ﬁndings \nof systematic reviews/meta-analyses and clinical trials, with local \npractices taken into consideration.",

As a \nwidespread health concern, ED substantially impacts the quality of life \nof affected individuals and their partners, leading to emotional distress, \nstrained relationships and diminished overall well-being.1, level III\nED can manifest in various forms which can be due to organic, \npsychogenic and mixed aetiologies.2 Organic ED may result \nfrom vascular, neurogenic, hormonal or anatomical factors, while \npsychogenic ED is often associated with psychosocial issues. Mixed \nED involves a combination of both organic and psychogenic factors, \nmaking a comprehensive understanding of the condition crucial for \neffective management.\nThe pathophysiology of ED is complex, involving intricate interplay \nbetween vascular, neurologic, hormonal and psychological factors. \nVascular insufficiency, endothelial dysfunction and altered smooth \nmuscle tone are common contributors. Understanding these \nmechanisms is essential for tailoring therapeutic interventions to the \nspecific needs of the patient.\nIn 1995, approximately 150 million men worldwide were estimated to be \naffected by ED and this is likely to double by 2025.3, level III Throughout \nAsia, there is variation in the prevalence rate of ED ranging between \n2.0% and 81.8%.4, level III A local study at five government primary care \nclinics in Petaling District showed that the prevalence of ED for males \naged 40 to 79 years old was 69.5%. It increased with age from 49.7% \nof men in their 40s to 66.5%, 92.8% and 93.9% of men in their 50s, 60s \nand 70s respectively.5, level III A recent study based on National Health \nand Morbidity Survey 2019 data revealed a prevalence of moderate \nto severe ED in men aged ≥18 years at 31.6% (95% CI 28.8 to\n34.6).6, level III\nThe burden of ED extends beyond its physical manifestations, impacting  \nthe mental and emotional well-being of individuals. It is associated with \nco- morbidities e.g. diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular diseases \n(CVDs) and depression. Moreover, ED is known to be an early marker \nof systemic vascular dysfunction, emphasising the importance of timely \ndiagnosis and intervention.2\nClinical practices for the diagnosis and treatment of ED can vary \nsignificantly, reflecting differences in healthcare systems, cultural \nperceptions and access to resources. Recognising and addressing \nthese variations is crucial to ensure equitable and effective care for the \naffected individuals.",

This is made worse by the public and \nhealthcare providers shying away from identifying and discussing the \nmatter in the clinical practice. In diagnosing ED, healthcare providers \nrequire expertise (knowledge and skills) to elicit the problem and \nprovide further management on it. Rigorous work-up and cardiovascular \nassessment further complicate diagnosing ED. Treatment-wise, \nthe limited availability of pharmacotherapy and mechanical devices \nmakes treating ED even more difficult. There is also an obvious lack \nof urologists and clinical psychologists especially in the public sector to \nhelp manage such cases.\nIn line with the key recommendations in this CPG, the following is \nproposed as clinical audit indicator for the quality management of ED:",
