This is \neven more important in the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). \nAn optimum result can only be achieved with a holistic approach and active \npatient participation with the support of appropriate diabetes education \nand lifestyle modification. In addition to its negative impact on the quality \nof life and health care costs, diabetes also increases the economic burden of \nindividuals, families and communities and, affects national productivity.\nI note that there has been a recent explosion of advances made in the \nmanagement of diabetic complications. The use of new technology and findings \nfrom landmark trials have changed clinical pathways and recommendations in \nthe way T2DM is managed. This has been reflected in the latest Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (CPG) for the Management of T2DM (6th Edition). These guidelines \nalso focus on preventing and reducing diabetes-related complications, \nthereby improving clinical outcomes. This CPG will form a valuable resource \nfor healthcare professionals from primary to tertiary care levels, to deliver the \nbest possible care for their patients, from disease prevention to treatment of \ncomplications.\n In this networked age, we should no longer be working in silos and I would \nlike to reaffirm the importance and recognition of a multidisciplinary approach \nin managing T2DM. I have been a champion for embracing technology and \ninnovation – and note that there is emphasis on the potential to use mobile \napps and other forms of technological advances / telemedicine to improve \ndiabetes self-management. The importance of this is even greater now in the \ncontext of the new norm forced on everyone by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe breadth and depth of material covered reflects the commitment and \nthe dedication of the CPG committee, despite the difficulties encountered \nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. I would like to congratulate the chairs and the \nmembers for their hard work and it is my sincere wish that this document will \nfurther elevate the standard of diabetes care and reduce the burden of T2DM \nin our country.\nTan Sri Dato' Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah",

            "text": "4\nFOREWORD\nby Chairpersons of T2DM Clinical Practice Guidelines, \n6th edition taskforce\nThese are exciting times for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) \nand a time for concern. The past 5 years have seen amazing breakthroughs that \ngive hope for people with T2DM. Several Cardiovascular Outcome trials (CVOTs) \nfrom 2 new classes of glucose-lowering agents have shown cardiovascular (CV) \nprotection, beyond glucose.\nOn the other hand, prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia continues to rise unabated. \nThe 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) shows a prevalence \nof 18.3% (for adults >18 years of age), a 4% increase from 2015; 48.6% were \nundiagnosed. In addition, ~5.0% of our young Malaysians between 18-29 years \nare also diabetic. It is worrying to see this trend. The frequent co-existence with \nother well-known comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, dyslipidaemia, overweight/\nobesity further complicates the situation. \nThe 5th edition of our Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of \nT2DM 2015, was detailed and comprehensive. Our aspiration was to build on \nthe previous CPG. Since then, there have been major advances; in therapeutics, \nnutrition, technology as well as, digital health. \nThe landmark CVOTs have consistently demonstrated positive beneficial CV \noutcomes in those with either established or at high risk for cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD). Another exciting advance has been the discovery of a 2nd \ntherapeutic class of agent, apart from the renin-angiotensin system blockers, \nto directly reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD remains \nthe largest contributor of new patients requiring dialysis in Malaysia and, \nrecent renal outcome trials definitively show positive outcomes for prevention \nof progression to end-stage renal failure and reduction of albuminuria. More \nexciting data may be forthcoming with ongoing dedicated trials investigating \neffects of these glucose-lowering agents, on heart failure and prevention \nof kidney disease not only in people with diabetes but also, in nondiabetic \nindividuals.\nThese results have led to paradigm shifts, changing practices as we move \nforward. The objective of these guidelines is to reflect the uptake of this \nnew data in clinical decision making and therefore, provide evidence-based \nrecommendations to assist healthcare providers in identifying, diagnosing and \nmanaging our patients with T2DM. Some of the other notable updates, include \nadditional sections on current hot topics; e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease",

The landmark CVOTs have been consolidated \nand summarised in Appendix 8.\nT2DM is not a stand-alone disease instead reaching across a spectrum of other \nnon-communicable diseases. Hence, in this updated guideline, we expanded our \ntaskforce to include colleagues from other specialities; including nephrology, \nneurology, gastroenterology-hepatology, cardiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry \nand dental surgery. The committee hopes that this combination of expertise \nhas enhanced the recommendations in this CPG to further improve clinical \ndecision making. \nThe development of these guidelines extended into an extraordinary situation \ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through it, the hardworking committee \nmembers of the taskforce, including our reviewers, persevered with continuous \nand timely discussions to reach consensus where required through use of \ntechnology/remote communication, enabling its completion.

Where relevant, experts from different specialties \nwere also included to review and update certain sub-sections within these \nguidelines. These included a nephrologist, neurologist, gastroenterologist-\nhepatologist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, psychiatrist, dental surgeon, \npharmacist and diabetes educator.\nThe previous edition of the CPG on Management of T2DM 2015 was used as \nthe basis for the development of this present guideline.\nLiterature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: \nPUBMED, Medline, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and \nJournal full text via OVID search engine. In addition, the reference lists of all \nrelevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies.\nReference was also made to the lastest edition of other guidelines on the \nmanagement of T2DM including guidelines developed by the American \nDiabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, American \nAssociation of Clinical Endocrinologists’, American College of Endocrinology, \nInternational Diabetes Federation (IDF) Global Guideline for Type 2 Diabetes, \nthe European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), National Institute \nFor Health and Care Excellence (NICE); Malaysian CPG on Management of \nObesity, Canadian Diabetes Association, The Royal Australian College of \nGeneral Practitioners and Diabetes Australia, Malaysian Dietitians’ Association, \nTrafford NHS Healthcare Trust and Joint British Diabetes Societies Inpatient \nCare Group.\nThese updated guidelines also include the latest cardiovascular outcome trials \n(CVOTs) and findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses in literature, \nall whilst taking into consideration local practices.\nClinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of \nthe task force were assigned individual topics within these subgroups.

Prediabetes is an important risk factor for future diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease (CVD). It is a potentially reversible condition with \nlifestyle modification.\n•\t T2DM is the most common form of diabetes mellitus, accounting for >90% of \nall cases of adult-onset diabetes mellitus in Malaysia. Both prediabetes and \ndiabetes commonly coexist with other non-communicable diseases namely \nhypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity.\n•\t With a high and increasing global, and local prevalence, T2DM represents a \nhuge socio-economic burden due to increased morbidity from accelerated \nvascular complications and premature death.\n•\t T2DM is characterised by progressive decline in beta-cell function associated \nwith insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue.\n›\t The insulin resistant state results in increased hepatic glucose output and \nreduced utilisation of glucose by various organs contributing to fasting \nhyperglycaemia and between meal hyperglycaemia.\n›\t Impaired intestinal incretin secretion causes compromised meal-related \ninsulin secretion and glucagon suppression contributing to postprandial \nhyperglycaemia.\n›\t Excessive renal tubular reabsorption of glucose further contributes to \nhyperglycaemia.\n•\t T2DM is an important risk factor for CVD and microvascular complications \nsuch as nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy.

Long-acting tends to accumulate longer than \nshort-acting insulin.\nDose escalation will depend on tolerability and according to the PI. \nGFR in ml/min/1.73 m2; *usual dose not maximum dose.\n^ Sulphonylureas should be used cautiously because of the increased risk of hypoglycaemia. First generation \nsulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide): generally, should be avoided due to long half-life and risk of \nhypoglycaemia in patients with CKD. Gliclazide and glipizide are the preferred agents among the second-\ngeneration sulphonylureas as they do not have active metabolites and have lower risk of hypoglycaemia \nin CKD patients.\n§ Metformin is eliminated via kidney and may accumulate in body as kidney function deteriorates, increase \nrisk of lactic acidosis.\n ¶SGLT2-i – eGFR below which this class of agents can be prescibed is expected to change, with the advent \nof their significant reno-protective and cardio-protective benefits; however, the indication may be for \ntheir reno and cardio-protective benefits rather than specifically for glucose lowering. At lower eGFR, \nglucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT2-i are modest.
