They are intended as a guide for \nthe best clinical practices in the management of mandibular condyle fractures presently. \nHowever, it must be noted that adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to \nthe best clinical outcomes in individual patient care, as every health care provider is \nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical \npresentations and management options available locally.  \n \nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES \n \nThese guidelines were issued in June 2019 and will be reviewed in 2024 or earlier if \nimportant new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, the head of the \nrelated specialty will be informed and a multidisciplinary team will be formed \nsubsequently. A discussion will be made on the need for a revision including the scope \nof the revised CPG.

The recommendations were formulated taking into consideration the best \navailable evidence and local practices. Several improvements have been introduced \nin this edition. The scope has been expanded to include management of all \nmandibular condyle fractures. In addition, new and updated information have been \nincluded in these guidelines. Besides this, clinical audit indicators have also been \nidentified for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes. \n \nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic databases: Medline, \nPubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and Embase while full \ntext journal articles were retrieved from these databases. The search was limited to \nliterature published from 2006 to 2017, humans and in English. The reference lists of \nall relevant articles retrieved were also searched to identify further studies. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off period. The search \nstrategy can be found in Appendix 1. The details of the search strategy can be \nobtained upon request from the Oral Health Technology Section, Oral Health \nProgramme, Ministry of Health Malaysia. \n \nThere were eight (8) clinical questions which were assigned to members of the \ndevelopment group. The group members met a total of 16 times throughout the \ndevelopment of these guidelines. All retrieved literature were appraised by at least \ntwo members, presented in the form of evidence tables and discussed during group \nmeetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by \nboth the development group and reviewers. This CPG is based on reference to the \nfindings of systematic review, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and \ncase reports, with local practices taken into consideration.   However, when there \nwas a lack of evidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group \nmembers. Although ideally patients’ views and preferences need to be considered in \nthe development of CPGs, in this instance, it was not feasible.",

INTRODUCTION \n \nThe Mandibular Condyle is the supero-posterior process on the ramus of the \nmandible and composed of two parts: a superior part, the articular portion / condylar \nhead, and an inferior part, the condylar neck (Figure 1). \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Anatomy of Mandibular Condyle \n \nThe main aetiology for condylar fractures varies according to geographical, socio-\neconomic and demographic (age and sex) status of the population. Motor vehicle \naccidents (MVA), interpersonal violence, falls and sports injuries were the most \ncommon causes seen in developed and developing countries. The mechanism of \ninjury involved in mandibular condyle fractures were: \n Indirect trauma, in which forces were transferred from the more resistant skeleton \n(e.g. chin region anteriorly and body of mandible region laterally) to the \nmandibular condyle. 1, level III \n The position of the jaw (open or closed) in relation to the direction and magnitude \nof the force also played a part in the type of fractures sustained.   \n \nThe mandible and zygoma by nature of their location and anatomy, are the two most \ncommonly fractured facial bones. In Malaysia, studies have shown that fractures of \nthe mandible range from 42.7% - 83.1% of all facial bone fractures. Inherently weak \nareas of the mandible which commonly fracture are the condyle, the angle and the \nparasymphysis. Condylar fractures have been reported to account for 19.3% - 33.2% \nof mandibular fractures. 2-4, level III",

For bilateral condylar fractures, the malocclusion \ncommonly present is an anterior open bite. \n \nMandibular hypomobility \nMandibular hypomobility can be defined in general as inter-incisal opening less than \n40 mm to frank ankyloses. 48, level III The affected mandibular movement includes \nmaximum inter-incisal opening (MIO), lateral excursive and protrusive jaw \nmovements are frequently adversely affected by mandibular condyle trauma. \n \nTemporomandibular joint complications \n Pain \nPain is usually moderate and located in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area or \nmuscles of mastication such as temporalis and masseter of the affected site. 49, level III \nThe pain is usually present on mouth opening but occasionally may be present \nduring occlusion. \n \n Temporo-mandibular joint derangement \nTMJ derangement occurs when there is a change in the shape of the disc. This \ncould lead to disc displacement and the major symptoms include joint sound, \nabnormal movement of the condyle head, impingement of condyle head, mandibular \nmovement limitation and joint pain. For TMJ derangement, changes in disc shape \nand the functional disorders of the condyle-disc complex are minimized and \nprevented by the early reduction and rigid fixation of the displaced bone fragments \nadjacent to the joint.",

Ankylosis is divided into intra-\ncapsular ankylosis and extra-capsular ankylosis. The ankylosis that is associated \nwith the untreated condylar fractures is the intra-capsular type. The subtypes of intra-\ncapsular ankylosis according to Sawhney (1986) 50, level III are:  \ni) Type 1: minimal bony fusion but extensive fibrous adhesions around the joint \nii) Type II: there is more bony fusion, especially at the outer edge of the joint surface, \nbut no fusion within the more medial area of the joint \niii) Type III: there is a bridge of bone between the mandible and the temporal bone \niv) Type IV: the joint is replaced by a mass of bone \n \n Traumatic arthritis of the TMJ \nTraumatic arthritis is an arthritis that occurs secondarily after the deformity of the \njoint.  It is caused by direct injury to the articular cartilage or fracture due to trauma. \nIn the intra-capsular fracture of the condyles, articular surface injury occurs during \nthe trauma onset, and subsequently traumatic arthritis occurs due to chronic and \nrepeated joint movement. 51, level III Clinical symptoms that may occur in an early \nphase include joint sound and pain during joint movement. As bony arthritis \nprogresses, joint sound increases and as well as lock sensation, pain, and mouth \nopening limitation. \n \nFacial deformity \nDecreased mandibular growth occurs in 20% to 25% of patients with mandibular \ncondyle fracture. 51, level III This growth abnormality has been reported to be attributed \nto direct condylar growth and severe functional disorders caused by adjacent \nmuscular stiffness, injury of soft tissues, and scars. The clinical features may include \nmandibular retrognathism, anterior open bite, chin deviation and contralateral \nposterior open bite. 52, level III",

(2012) found, when compared with the retromandibular \napproach, the pre-auricular approach had more postoperative facial nerve \nweakness which they attributed to retraction injury to access lower neck \nfractures. 53, level III  \n Cosmetically, the scar is well hidden within the pre-auricular crease. 53, level III \n \n2. Retromandibular approach   \n Indications: direct access to the ramus and the condylar neck with minimal  \n    retraction. \n Risk of facial nerve damage via the retromandibular approach is minimal. This \nrisk is increased with prolonged traction at the operative site, surgeon’s \nexperience, post injury edema, and other factors causing difficult wound \naccess such as obesity. 29, level I \n \n3.
