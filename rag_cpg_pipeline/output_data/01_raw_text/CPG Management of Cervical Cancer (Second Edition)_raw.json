Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily \nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is \nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the \nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options \navailable locally. \nThese guidelines were issued in 2015 and will be reviewed in 2019 or \nsooner if new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, \nthe Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty \nwill be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for \na revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary \nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used \nby MaHTAS will be employed.",

Refer \nto Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria \nare all literature on women with cervical cancer, regardless of study \ndesign. The search was limited to literature published in the last ten \nyears and on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of \nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify \nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify \nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 11 Jan 2013 to 20 \nFeb 2013. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions \nat the end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant \npapers published before 28 February 2015 to be included. Future CPG \nupdates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The \ndetails of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the \nCPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other CPG on cervical cancer developed \nby Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) 2008. The CPG \nwas evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and \nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.\nA total of 13 clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. \nThe DG members met 26 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. These CPG are \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.",

Despite numerous screening programmes for early detection \nof pre-invasive disease of the cervix, many women have been diagnosed \nat invasive stage of cervical cancer. This has tremendous implications \nto the patients, carers and healthcare system.  \nThe first edition of CPG on Management of Cervical Cancer was \npublished in 2003. Many new development especially in the treatment \nof the condition has emerged which lead to variation in clinical practice. \nBased on these, the CPG have been updated using a systematic review \nmethodology. It aims to guide healthcare providers on the evidence-\nbased management of invasive cervical cancer in the Malaysian \nhealthcare setting.\n2.\t EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThere is an increasing trend of cancer worldwide. A total of 14.1 million \nnew cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths occurred in 2012, \ncompared to 12.7 million and 7.6 million respectively in 2008. Cervical \ncancer is the fifth (3.7%) common cause of cancer following prostate \n(7.9%), colorectal (9.7%), breast (11.9%) and lung cancer (13.0%) \nglobally. It is the fourth (7.9%) common cause of cancer among women \nafter breast (25.2%), colorectal (9.2%) and lung cancer (8.8%). Seventy \npercent of cervical cancer cases occur in low resourced countries.1, level III \nIn Malaysia, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer \namong women following breast cancer.1 - 2, level III The age-standardised \nrate is highest among Indians (10.3/100,000) followed by Chinese \n(9.5/100,000) and Malays (5.3/100,000). The rate increases after 30 \nyears of age and peaks at 65 - 69 years. Among all cancer deaths, \ncervical cancer ranked fifth.3, level III   \nIn the United States, a declining overall incidence of cervical cancer \nhas been reported; largely attributed to the decrease in the incidence \nof squamous cell carcinoma. However, there is an unexplained rise of \nadenocarcinoma (AC).4, level II-2 There is no published local data on the \ntrend of cervical cancer.",

A thorough pelvic \nexamination with/without anaesthesia is mandatory to provide \ninformation for the staging. When there is doubt as to which stage a \nparticular cancer should be allocated, the lower stage is assigned.19, level III\nThe office pelvic examination has a weak but significant correlation \nwith the actual extent of disease in determination of vaginal (r=0.255, \np<0.01) and parametrial invasion (r=0.174, p<0.01).

It also has high accuracy in early FIGO stage cervical cancer \n(85.4% for stage IB1 and 77.4% for stage IB2) but low accuracy in \nFIGO stage II (35.5% for stage IIA and 20.5% for stage IIB).22, level III\nThe following examinations are permitted for the determination of FIGO \nstaging, as indicated by presenting characteristics: palpation, inspection, \ncolposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, \nintravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton. \nBlood tests should include full blood count, renal and liver function tests. \nSyphilis and human immunodeficiency virus serology need to be \nconsidered based on discussion with the patient about risk factors.21, level III\n•\t Initial assessment of microinvasive disease\n\t Assessment of FIGO stage IA\nDiagnosis of both Stage IA1 and IA2 should be based on microscopic \nexamination of excised tissue, including cone biopsy with negative \nmargins, trachelectomy or hysterectomy.

Acute radiation complication refers to radiation-induced injury \nduring the time of treatment and for up to 90 days after completion of \nRT. This is a frequently occurring early adverse effect and the pathology \nis of an inﬂammatory process affecting the rectal or bladder mucosa, \nand is generally self-limiting. \nLate radiation complications are complications occurring more than 90 \ndays after completing radiotherapy treatment and are relatively rare. \nThe underlying pathology is of submucosal injury with a combination of \nﬁbrosis, ischaemia, and subsequent ulceration, which can be localised, \ndiffuse or full thickness penetrating the wall of the rectum. The \nclinical presentation may have an inﬂammatory component producing \ntenesmus, urgency, diarrhoea, constipation, anal sphincter dysfunction \n(affecting the control of the bowels), mucoid or bloody discharge per \nrectum or frank bleeding with ulceration which may perforate. These \nchronic and episodic symptoms will cause impaired QOL of the patients.\nAt present, there is no recommended standard treatment for both late \nradiation proctitis and cystitis in view of lack of evidence with regards \nto effectiveness and impact on QOL by the treatment approaches or \nmethods.

This \naims to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality.\na.\t Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG \ninclude:-\n•\t dissemination of CPG\n\t availability and dissemination of CPG to healthcare providers \n(hardcopies and softcopies)\n\t conferences and updates on management of cervical cancer \n•\t implementation of CPG\n\t public awareness via Cervical Cancer Awareness\n\t accessibility to relevant multidisciplinary teams\n\t active involvement of government and non-governmental \norganisations\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG \nare:-\n•\t limited awareness in managing and referrals among primary care \nproviders\n•\t variation of practice and treatment at different levels of care\n•\t limited facilities and human resources\n•\t inadequate training at all levels of healthcare providers\n•\t lack of networking between public and private health-care providers\nb.\t Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be a strong commitment to:- \n•\t distribute the CPG widespread to healthcare providers\n•\t strengthen training on cervical cancer management for healthcare \nproviders \n•\t establish a cervical cancer registry in Malaysia\n•\t develop of multidisciplinary teams in secondary and tertiary care \nlevels",
