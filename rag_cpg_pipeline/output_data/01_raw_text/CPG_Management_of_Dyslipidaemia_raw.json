Specific attempts were made to use local data and publications to \nensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not necessarily lead to the \nbest clinical outcome in individual patient care. Every health care provider is \nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical \npresentation and management options available locally.\n REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline is issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in about 5 years or earlier if \nimportant new evidence becomes available.\nCPG Secretariat\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia\nAvailable on the following websites:\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadmed.org.my\nThis is an update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines on Management of \nDyslipidaemia published in 2011.

            "text": "2\n MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nDyslipidaemia remains a significant problem in Malaysia, with the \nNational Health and Morbidity survey in 2015 reporting an estimated \n47% of the adult population having hypercholesterolaemia. In the \nmain, dyslipidaemia is asymptomatic but its associations with serious \nvascular conditions such as acute myocardial infarction and stroke is \nwell known. \nThe previous edition of the National Clinical Practice Guidelines \n(CPGs) were launched in 2011. Since then, the evidence base on this \nsubject has grown and new treatments now available. In addition, \nmore clinical information on dyslipidaemia has emerged from Malaysia and the region. \nTherefore, this edition, which is the 5th Edition of the CPG on the Management of Dyslipidaemia, \nis timely. \nAccessing this CPG, and others endorsed by the Ministry of Health, by healthcare providers is \nnow easier, with the advent of modern telecommunications – downloading a soft copy of this \nCPG should be a seamless affair. I anticipate the readership of this and other such CPGs to grow \nand the information provided be useful for healthcare providers in their day to day management \nof patients.\nI would like to congratulate the multidisciplinary team for working together for many months to\nproduce this CPG. Members of the this CPG Expert Panel consist of experts from both the \nprivate and public sectors, from primary to tertiary care centres, and from across the country. \nUnder the capable and enthusiastic leadership of Dr Robaayah Zambahari, supported by Dr \nJeyamalar Rajadurai, the Expert Panel regularly met to ensure the most recent and relevant \ninformation are incorporated into this CPG. I also thank members of the Panel of External \nReviewers for their efforts.\nFinally, I hope elements of this CPG will be put into practice on a daily basis, to tackle the \nproblem of dyslipidaemia in this country, and eventually result in a drop in mortality and morbidity \nassociated with vascular disease. I am sure this 5th Edition of the CPG on the Management of \nDyslipidaemia (2017) will go a long way towards achieving this.\nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector General of Health Malaysia\nEdition of \nClinical Practice Guidelines\n5\nth",

            "text": "5\nRATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT\nRationale:\nIn Malaysia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in both men \nand women1. CVD includes coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease \nand peripheral arterial disease. CHD is a spectrum ranging from stable angina to \nacute coronary syndromes (ACS). \nThe prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors – dyslipidaemia, \nhypertension, diabetes, smoking and overweight/obesity have been on an \nincreasing trend. Malaysians develop heart disease (ACS) at a younger age when \ncompared to people in Thailand, mainland China and western countries. Our local \nNCVD-ACS Registry (2011-2013), showed that most patients (96.8%) had at least \none established CV risk factor – hypertension (65%), dyslipidaemia (37%) and/or \ndiabetes (46%)2. \nIn preventing CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global risks. This Clinical \nPractice Guideline (CPG) is on management of dyslipidaemia. The last CPG (4th \nedition) was published in 2011. Thus the need for an update.\nObjectives:\nThe objective of this clinical practice guideline is to review:\n• \nThe \nclinical \nevidence \nlinking \ndyslipidaemia \nand \natherosclerosis. \n \nAtherosclerosis affects the entire vascular tree. However, evidence for a causal \n \nlink is strongest for CVD (heart disease and strokes). \n• \nStrategies for assessing CV risk that is most applicable to our local \n \npopulation.\n• \nEvidence based management of dyslipidaemia, utilising existing healthcare \n \nresources wherever possible.\nProcess:\nThis CPG has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart \nAssociation of Malaysia, Ministry of Health and the Academy of Medicine. It \ncomprises cardiologists, endocrinologists, general physicians, pharmacists and \ndieticians from the government and private sectors as well as from the Universities.\nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic databases – PubMed \nand Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. The following MeSH terms \nor free text terms were used either singly or in combination:\n“Hyperlipidaemia”; “Dyslipidaemia”; “Hypercholesterolemia”; “Cholesterol”; \n“LDL-cholesterol” “HDL-cholesterol”; “Triglycerides”; Diabetic dyslipidaemia”\n2017\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017",

The relevant articles were carefully selected from \nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were \nsearched to identify further studies. The search was conducted from August \n2010 (date of last review for previous CPG) till 31st August 2016.\nLocal guidelines were also studied. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain \nfurther information. International guidelines mainly that from the American Heart \nAssociation/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the European \nSociety of Cardiology were used as main references. \nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up by the members of the Expert \nPanel and submitted to the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice \nGuidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and key health personnel in the major \nhospitals of the Ministry of Health and the Private Sector for review and feedback. \n \nThe clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of the Expert \nPanel were assigned individual topics. The group members met several times \nthroughout the development of the guideline. All retrieved literature was appraised \nby individual members and subsequently presented for discussion during group \nmeetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively \nby members of the Expert Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient the \nrecommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. The draft was then sent \nto local external reviewers for comments. It was also sent to the American College of \nCardiology and the European Society of Cardiology for feedback. \nThe level of recommendation and the grading of evidence used in this guideline was \nadapted from the American Heart Association and the European Society of \nCardiology (ACC/ESC) and outlined on page 10. In the text, this is written in black \non the left hand margin.\nClinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated using the PICO \nmethod, addressing diagnosis and therapy of dyslipidaemia.\nFor diagnosis:\n      •   Does measuring the lipid profile in the fasting as compared to the          \n          non-fasting state, result in a significant difference in the measured values?\n      •   Does measuring the lipid profile in the fasting as compared to the     \n          non-fasting state, have an impact on cardiovascular risk estimation?    \nEdition of \nClinical Practice Guidelines\n5\nth",

CVD includes coronary heart \ndisease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease (strokes) and peripheral arterial disease \n(PAD). \nAccording to the National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS) the prevalence of \nthe common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors among adults ≥ 18 years had been on \nan increasing trend.6–8 (Table 8, pg. 24). The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia \nhad risen by 46% over the 4 years, 2011 – 20157,8. Almost 1 in 5 adults in the 18-19 \nyear age group had hypercholesterolemia.8 The prevalence increased with age, from \n22.0% in the 18-19 year age group, reaching a peak of 68.8% among adults aged \n55-59 years. The prevalence was the same in both rural and urban areas. A similar \nsurvey carried out recently among 13-year old students from both urban and rural \npublic schools, found that almost 23% of them had total cholesterol >5.2 \nmmol/L.9\nAlthough atherosclerosis affects the entire vascular tree- coronary, cerebral and \nperipheral vessels- the causal link between hypercholesterolemia and CVD (heart \ndisease and strokes) has been most well established. (Section 4, pg. 30). \nData from the National Cardiovascular Disease – Acute Coronary Syndrome \n(NCVD-ACS) Registry 2011-2013, indicated that Malaysians developed acute \ncoronary syndrome (ACS) at a younger age than that seen in neighbouring \ncountries.2 The mean age was 58.5 years and the peak incidence was in the 51-60 \nyear age group.2 This is younger than that noted in Thailand (63.5 years)10 and \nSingapore (median: 68.3-69.2 years).11 About 6.6% of our patients admitted with \nACS were <40 years2.\nIn the prevention of CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global risks. This \nguidelines emphasize:\n• \nA multifactorial approach that addresses all risk factors. This is because the \n \nbenefits of modifying several risk factors simultaneously are synergistic.\n• \nThat preventing CVD should be directed at global CVD burden rather than CHD \n \nalone.\nThere already exists clinical practice guidelines (CPG) addressing specific CV risk \nfactors. The objectives of this CPG on the Management of Dyslipidaemia are to:\n• \nCritically review the role of dyslipidaemia as a CV risk factor.\n \n2017\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017",

Muscle Symptoms\n• \nIn clinical practice and registries, 10-30% of patients report statin-associated \n \nmuscle symptoms (SAMS).203,204 This includes myalgia (normal creatine \n \nkinase (CK)), myositis (CK > ULN) and rhabdomyolysis (CK > 10X of ULN). \n \n The incidence of SAMS is much lower in clinical trials, and only differs \n \n \nslightly from placebo.205-207 In observational studies, the frequency \n \n \nvaries between 10 and 15%208-209. In a study by Parker designed \n \n \nspecifically to study the effects of statins on muscle symptoms, the \n \n \nfrequency of muscle-related complaints was approximately 9%.210 \n \n Myalgia (without CK elevation) occurs in 5-10% of patients in clinical \n \n \npractice.210 If the symptoms are not tolerable or are progressive, the dose \n \n \nof statin should be reduced or the drug stopped. \n \n The incidence of myopathy (myositis and rhabdomyolysis) is low and is \n \n \nmore likely to occur in persons with complex medical problems (in particular \n \n \nCKD) and/or who are taking multiple medications, or in elderly persons, \n \n \nespecially women. \n• \nCreatine Kinase (CK) is not routinely measured unless myositis is suspected. If  \n \nthe level is more than five times the ULN on two occasions, the drug should be  \n \ndiscontinued. \n• \nThere is no uniform definition for statin intolerance. In certain trials; ‘statin \n \nintolerant’ patients are defined as patients unable to tolerate at least two different \n \nstatins because of unexplained skeletal muscle-related symptoms (pain, aches, \n \nweakness, or cramping) that began or increased during statin therapy and \n \nreturned to baseline when statin therapy was discontinued.205 \n• \nWhen a statin myopathy is suspected, typically the first step is statin \n \ndiscontinuation for 2-3 weeks.\n \n If symptoms have not resolved, it is unlikely to be statin related and the \n \n \npatient should be continued on the same dose of statin \n \n If symptoms have resolved, then the following strategies may be \n \n \nconsidered:\n \n \n▪  Lowering the dose or decreasing the frequency to less than daily.211 \n \n \n▪  An alternative dosing such as every other day or twice a week with \n \n \n  atorvastatin or rosuvastatin212 can be used\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017",

A recent trial suggested no harm of stopping statins in the elderly with \na limited life expectancy.352 Taken together, the recommendations of \ncholesterol-lowering treatment in the elderly should be followed with caution \nand common sense, adverse effects should be monitored closely and \ntreatment should be reconsidered periodically.\nRecommendations:\n \n• \nThe goals of lipid lowering therapy is similar in both gender and in  \n \n \nthe elderly.

A number of scientific studies have shown that adherence among patients \nwith chronic disease is only about 50%.353\nLack of adherence threatens the success of the guideline recommendation and \nimplementation. The amount of risk reduction achieved is related to the level of \nadherence to treatment. Compared with poor adherence, good adherence was \nassociated with lower mortality.354 More importantly, lack of adherence leads to \nmissed opportunity for the risk reducing benefits of the treatment, thus creating \nenormous costs to the health system for treating CV events that could have been \nprevented.353 \nThe reasons for the high discontinuation rate and missed doses are complex and \nmultifactorial \nand \nmay \ninclude \nboth \nintentional \nand \nunintentional \nnon-adherence.355–358 These include:\n• \ncost of medication \n• \naffordability\n• \nunclear label instructions\n• \npatient forgetfulness\n• \nadverse effects from medication that patient is too embarrassed to discuss with \n \ndoctor\n• \npatient does not like the idea of having to take medication\n• \npatient does not understand the importance of a given medication for a \n \ncondition for which he or she has no symptoms\n• \npatient-practitioner relationship is suboptimal\n• \npolypharmacy and complexity of regimen\nTo improve adherence and compliance the following are recommended:357,358\n• \nPatient factors\n \n Simplify medication regimens using wherever possible drugs with a single \n \n \ndaily or twice daily dosing\n \n Give clear instructions\n \n Encourage the support of the family\n \n Involve patients in their care through self-monitoring\n \n Remind patients that lipid lowering drugs are not a substitute for dietary \n \n \nand lifestyle interventions\nEdition of \nClinical Practice Guidelines\n5\nth",

FAQS on Lipids\nWhat is the role of \nnon-statin therapy \nin dyslipidaemia \nEvidence \nGrade \nCholesterol and \nheart disease \nIs cholesterol an important cause of heart disease? \n• The role of serum cholesterol in the pathogenesis of \natherosclerosis and CVD is unequivocal and irrefutable.  \n• The question is whether eating food high in cholesterol leads \nto high serum cholesterol and LDL-C, and whether limiting \ndietary cholesterol intake lowers serum LDL-C. \n• Recent data indicate that the impact of dietary cholesterol on \nserum cholesterol levels is weak. \n \nStatins safety \nStatins are safe. Its side effects are uncommon, self-limiting, are \nreversible, and have no long term sequelae  \nI, A \nFish oil \nsupplements \n• It may be useful in the treatment of elevated triglycerides. \n• Fish oils is not a replacement for statins in the treatment of \nelevated LDL-C. \nIIa, B \nIII, A \nCo-enzyme Q10 \nNo definitive evidence to support the use of Co-enzyme Q10 on \nthe reduction of cholesterol level and primary prevention of \nCVD.359,360  \nIII, A \nComplementary and alternative therapies: \nEstrogen and \nprogestins \nHormone replacement is not indicated for primary or secondary \nprevention of CVD \nIII, A \nRed yeast rice \n• Red yeast rice contains substances that are structurally \nidentical to statins. \n• Unlike statins, there is no data on its safety in long term use. \n \nIIb, C \nGarlic \nNatural Medicine Comprehensive Database recently downgraded \ngarlic to a rating of “Possibly ineffective”.
