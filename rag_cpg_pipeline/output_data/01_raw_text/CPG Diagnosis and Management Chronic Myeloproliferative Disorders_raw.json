There are many causes for elevated cell\ncounts and one of them is chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). It is important not\nto miss the diagnosis of MPD because of the thrombotic and bleeding complications that\nare not uncommonly seen as well as the small risk of leukaemic transformation.\nAs the diagnosis of MPD is one of exclusion, a guideline is urgently needed to assist clinicians\nand haematologists alike in making a definitive diagnosis.\nWith the development of this guideline, we hope to create a better understanding of the\nMPDs among physicians such that appropriate management and referral to the haematologists\nare undertaken.\nJameela Sathar\nPresident\nMalaysian MPD Group\ni",

The MPDs are further classified into four groups: Polycythaemia Rubra Vera(PRV),\nEssential Thrombocythaemia(ET), Myelofibrosis with Myeloid Metaplasia(MMM) and the\nunclassified MPDs.\nThere is no specific test to diagnose MPD; the diagnosis is one of exclusion. It is important\nnot to miss the diagnosis as delay in treatment may lead to thrombotic complications with\nincreased morbidity and mortality.\nThe clinical practice guideline on “ Diagnosis & Management of Myeloproliferative\nDisorders in Malaysia” was prepared by a group of haematologists based on a systematic\nreview of evidence and clinical practices. The Malaysian MPD group is affiliated to the\nAsia Pacific MPD Study Group comprising countries from Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong,\nSingapore, Australia, Thailand and Indonesia.\nObjectives\nThe aim of the guideline is to provide diagnostic criteria and proper management for patients\nwith MPD.\nTarget Population\nThis guideline is targeted to patients with high cell counts where no obvious cause is found.\nTarget Group\nThis guideline is developed for clinicians and haematologists.\niii",

PRV and ET are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis.\nChronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) had been traditionally considered as part of chronic\nmyeloproliferative disorder.  As the emphasis on Philadelphia Chromosome became more\nprominent, CML evolved into its own entity defined by the translocation t(9:22) whereas\nthe remaining disorders not associated with the translocation remain as part of MPD.\nThe combined overall incidence of MPD is 100-150 cases/year/million population in Europe.\nThe respective incidences of PRV, ET, MMM are approximately 2.3, 2.5 and 1.3 per 100,000\npopulation1 . Median age at diagnosis is similar among the MPD, about 60 years. There is a\nslight preponderance of males in PRV and MMM and of females in ET.\n1",

In\nnearly 25% of patients, an episode of venous or arterial thrombosis, such as deep vein\nthrombosis, myocardial ischaemia or stroke, is the first manifestation. Mesenteric and portal\nor splenic vein thrombosis should always lead to consideration of PRV as a possible cause,\nand may even precede the onset of an overt polycythaemic stage. Vasomotor symptoms\nsuch as headache, dizziness, visual disturbances and paresthesias are also major complaints.\nOther findings may include pruritus, erythromelalgia and gout.

Serum thrombopoeitin (TPO) levels are usually\nelevated or normal despite an increased megakaryocyte mass and this has been attributed\nto ineffective TPO clearance because of the markedly reduced TPO-receptor (c-Mpl)\nexpression in platelets and megakaryocytes, rather than an overproduction of TPO.12\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis of ET is made by excluding both reactive thrombocytosis and thrombocytosis\nassociated with another myeloid disorder (Table 4) & (Table 5). All cases of thrombocytosis\nfrom automated counter should be counter checked by blood smear to exclude\npseudothrombocytosis secondary to cellular fragments.\nTable 4.

Instead, thrombotic events occurred at a wide range of\nplatelet counts.16,17,18,19 In two studies, patients with extreme thrombocytosis (>1000x109/L)\nwere reported to have a much higher incidence of haemorrhagic events. This may be due to\nthe acquired von Willebrand syndrome.\nLeukaemic transformation occurs in less than 5% of all patients with ET. Among 74 young\nwomen with ET observed for up to 26 years, only 1 developed acute leukaemia and 3\ndeveloped post-thrombocythaemic myelofibrosis.20\nSpontaneous first trimester abortions occur in up to 45% of pregnancies in ET. 21\nPrognostic Factors\nAge and a history of previous thrombosis are the most powerful predictors of recurrent\nthrombosis in ET.

Although the study\nby Ruggeri et al 25 concluded that low-risk ET patients do not require treatment, aspirin use\nwas not controlled in this study.

To date, there is no\nrandomized study that directly implicates hydroxyurea as being more leukemogenic. Some\nlong term studies found that a proportion of ET patients treated with hydroxyurea developed\nacute leukaemia.26,27 In other studies, this drug was not associated with an increase risk of\nleukaemic transformation.28,29 As the leukaemogenecity of hydroxyurea is still being debated,\nit is recommended that this drug is reserved for the elderly (>60 years). Initial starting dose\nis 15-20 mg/kg/day or 500mg daily or bd. Side effects are neutropenia, anaemia, oral ulcers,\nhyperpigmentation, rash and nail changes.\nAnagrelide is an oral imidazoquinazoline derivative that has a platelet lowering effect. It\ncan control thrombocytosis in > 80% of patients regardless of previous treatments30,31. The\ndrug may interfere with megakaryocyte maturation, resulting in the underproduction of\nplatelets. The mode of action is unclear but it could be that anagrelide blocks the c-mpl\nreceptor on the surface of the megakaryocyte, thereby interfering with the action of\nthrombopoeitin on the cell. As there is no risk of leukaemogenecity with the use of anagrelide,\nthis drug is preferred for younger patients. Initial dose is 0.5mg three to four times a day\n(maximum tolerable daily dose is 8 mg). Side effects are headache, forceful heart beats,\npalpitations, diarrhoea and fluid retention. It is contraindicated in patients with congestive\nheart failure and pregnancy.\n9",

An overview of the literature indicates that treatment with 3 to 5 million units\nsubcutaneously three times a week give an 86% haematologic response rate and a 32%\nreduction in spleen size.
