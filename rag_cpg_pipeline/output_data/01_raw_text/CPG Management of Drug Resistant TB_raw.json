There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.  \n \nA total of 14 clinical questions of the CPG were developed under different sections. Members of \nthe DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer to Appendix 1 for Clinical \nQuestions). The CPG was adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines only as it \nis mostly well-accepted guidelines, namely:  \n \nGuidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, emergency \nupdate 2008 \nGuidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2011 \nupdate \nDefinitions and reporting framework for tuberculosis, - 2013 revision \nCompanion handbook to the WHO guidelines for the programmatic management of \ndrug-resistant tuberculosis (2014) \nWHO treatment guidelines for drug-resistant tuberculosis- 2016 update \n \nThe adaptation process followed the Manual on Adaptation of Evidence Based Clinical Practice \nGuidelines of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (which was adapted from ADAPTE Resource \nToolkit for Guideline Adaptation). Assessment of the WHO Guidelines showed that the quality \n[using Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool], currency, content, \nconsistency and applicability of the documents justified them to be adapted for local use.  \n \nThe CPG DG had decided that no literature search was required in the adaptation process \nbecause the evidence use is sufficient enough for management of DR-TB cases in the country.  \nAll statements and recommendations were modified and formulated (when necessary) with local \npractices taken into consideration. They were agreed upon by both the DG and RC.  \n \nOn completion, the draft CPG was sent for review by WHO (author of the CPGs that being \nadapted) and external reviewers.  It was also posted on the MOH Malaysia official website for \nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory \nCommittee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MOH Malaysia for final review and \napproval. \n \nOBJECTIVES \n \nTo provide evidence-based recommendations on the effectiveness and safe management of \npatients with drug-resistant tuberculosis  \n \nCLINICAL QUESTIONS \n \nRefer to Appendix 1",

INTRODUCTION \n \nIn the mid of the twentieth century, tuberculosis (TB) was thought to have been beaten. \nHowever, this disease is now back with a vengeance and drug resistant forms are \nincreasing to almost an epidemic proportion in certain parts of the world. The burden of \nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing both globally and locally. WHO \nestimated about 480,000 people develop MDR-TB worldwide in 20131. The number of \npeople diagnosed with MDR-TB tripled between 2009 and 2013, and reached 136,000 \nworldwide. In Malaysia, there were 101 cases of MDR-TB reported in 2015 (refer to Fig. \n1)2. The globalisation of the recent century has made the spread of diseases more rapid \nwith massive migrations.  \n \n \nFig. 1: Cases of MDR-TB, Malaysia (2004-2015)  \n \nThough MDR-TB has multifactorial causes, the main reason for the emergence of this scourge \nis improper treatment. This may be caused by non-compliance, poor treatment regimes, poor \nquality of drugs or concomitant medical diseases. Besides the toll on the health of individuals \nsuffering from MDR-TB, the cost is also devastating economically. Estimated direct cost of the \ndrug to treat one MDR-TB patient is RM 15,000.00 compared to RM250.00 for treatment of one \ndrug susceptible TB patient. Currently, it is not just MDR-TB but extensively drug-resistant TB \n(XDR-TB) has emerged to further complicate the management of drug-resistant TB. \nWe are currently in urgent need to have guidelines locally to help guide and standardise \nmanagement of DR-TB which include diagnosis, treatment, prevention and surveillance among \nhealthcare providers in Malaysia. It was decided to adapt the World Health Organization (WHO) \nguidelines on the Programmatic Management of DR-TB which involves documents published in \n2008, 2011, 2013, 2014 and the latest 2016 update in the development of the guidelines. The \n2016 update introduces the concept of shorter MDR-TB treatment regime between 9-12 months \nfor newly diagnosed patients. Besides improving compliance, it would also significantly reduce \nthe cost of treating MDR-TB (refer appendix 2). These guidelines, the first in the country for the \nmanagement of DR-TB, definitely are helpful to the healthcare providers in managing the \nmedical condition more effectively and successfully.  \n13 \n17 \n42 \n41 \n56 \n55 \n64 \n141 \n74 \n124 \n104 \n101 \n0 \n20 \n40 \n60 \n80 \n100 \n120 \n140 \n160 \n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 \nMDR Case \nYear",

PREVENTION OF DRUG-RESISTANT TB \n \nThe best way to treat MDR-TB is to prevent it from happening in the first place.

FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF DR-TB \nThe Tuberculosis Control Programme consists of five essential components of a framework that \nembodied the whole management aspect of TB. It is tailored according to local situation and \nintegrated into Direct Observe Treatment Short-course (DOTS) based National Tuberculosis \nProgramme (NTP). \n3.1 DOTS framework as applied to the management of DR-TB \nThe DOTS strategy is applicable to the whole TB control including DR-TB, as the principles are \nthe same.  \n3.1.1 Sustained political commitment \nPolitical commitment is important in fostering national and international partnerships which \nshould be linked to long-term strategic action plans prepared by NTPs. Long term investment \nand leadership run parallel in order to ensure an appropriate integration of DR-TB management \ninto NTP. Appropriate integration refers to: \n• securing adequate infrastructure,  \n• development and retention of human resources,  \n• interagency cooperation,  \n• enactment of necessary legislation,  \n• TB control policies enabling implementation of the programme \n• \nfacilitation of the procurement of quality-assured second-line drugs and equipment for \ndiagnostic purposes  \nEffective TB control strategy and implementation can only takes place with a clear and \nsustained political commitment. \n \n3.1.2 Rational case-finding strategy; accentuating on the importance of timely diagnosis \nthrough quality-assured culture, molecular testings and Drug Susceptibility Test \n(DST)  \nTB control largely depends on timely and correct diagnosis. Quality assurance and proficiency \ntesting with a recognised reference laboratory such as one of the WHO-recognized National \nReference Laboratory must be in place. Ideally, one culture/ DST centre is in place for every five \nmillion populations (1: 5,000,000). Unreliable laboratory results due to non-viable cultures, \ncontamination, clerical or administrative error will give impact to NTP. \n \nRecommendation 1 \n• \nAll tuberculosis patients should have universal access to diagnostic test specifically \nCulture and  Drug Susceptibility Test. \n \n3.1.3 Case management (case holding) by appropriate treatment strategies with second-\nline drugs \n \nAn excellent DR-TB treatment centre delivers an optimal treatment regimen, in a patient-\ncentered approach concept which includes DOT and monitoring of drug adverse reactions.

QMS is necessary to ensure accurate detection of drug \nresistance and also to avoid false diagnoses. In addition, documented first-line DST proficiency, \npreferably by the reference laboratory, is strongly recommended for drug-resistant TB control \nprogrammes. \n \nQuality Management System should include; \n• standard operating procedures (SOPs) \n• internal quality control \n• external quality assessment  \n \nEstablishing and maintaining laboratory networks is challenging, difficult and costly.

It may be used as a follow-on test to microscopy in adults and children \nclinically suspicious of TB where MDR-TB and HIV is of lesser concern, especially in \nfurther testing of smear-negative specimens where resources are available. \n \nXpert MTB/RIF assay cannot be used as a replacement for smear and culture isolation for \nmonitoring the response of DR-TB patients to therapy  \n \n6.4.3 Line probe assay \n \nLine probe assay (LPA) allows rapid detection of resistance to rifampicin (alone or in \ncombination with isoniazid). LPAs are suitable for use at the central or national reference \nlaboratory level, with potential for decentralization to regional level if the appropriate \ninfrastructure can be ensured.  \n \nFor patients with confirmed rifampicin-resistant TB or MDR-TB, SL-LPA may be used as the \ninitial test to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs. This \nrecommendation applies to the use of SL-LPA for testing sputum specimens (direct testing) and \ncultured isolates of M. tuberculosis complex (indirect testing) from both pulmonary and \nextrapulmonary sites.  \n  \n6.4.4 Culture of MTB \n \nCulture in liquid media is the current reference method for bacteriological confirmation of TB. \nHowever, good quality specimens, prompt transport to the laboratory and quality of laboratory \nprocessing (appropriate digestion and decontamination, as well as good quality culture media \nand incubation conditions) are critical to optimize the yield of culture. Laboratory errors, may \nlead to false-negative or false-positive results. Therefore, laboratory findings should always be \ncorrelated with the patient’s clinical condition and any diagnostic test should be repeated if \nnecessary.  \n \nThe recovery of tubercle bacilli is higher and the time to detection is shorter with liquid \nculture compared to solid culture methods. However, as it is more sensitive, it has higher \ncontamination rates than solid media.",

However, if tolerance is an issue, \ncycloserine, ethionamide and PAS dosing can be increased gradually over a two-week \nperiod. \n• \nPyrazinamide, ethambutol and fluoroquinolones should be given once a day.  \n• \nEthionamide/prothionamide, cycloserine and PAS have traditionally been given in split \ndoses during the day to reduce adverse effects.",

The benefit and risk of treatment to the patients should be considered before it is \ninitiated and frequent monitoring may be necessary.  \n \n9.1 Pregnancy \n \nDR-TB is seen frequently in young people as well as women of childbearing age. Toxicity of the \ndrugs used in DR-TB treatment during pregnancy creates anxiety not only for patients but also \nfor clinicians. \n  \nDR-TB and its treatment during pregnancy pose great risk to the mother and fetus however \npregnancy is not a contraindication for treatment of active drug-resistant TB. A decision to \nstart treatment especially in the first trimester or to postpone should be agreed upon by the \npatient and the doctor.  \n \n \nRecommendation 7 \n• All female patients of child bearing age who are diagnosed DR-TB should be tested for \npregnancy. \n• Pregnant patients should be started on treatment as soon as the diagnosis is made. \nHowever, treatment may be delayed until the second trimester if the patient is stable with \nminimum disease.  \n• The treatment regimen should contain three or four second-line anti-TB drugs which are \nlikely to be effective plus pyrazinamide and reinforced with an injectable agent and other \ndrugs as needed immediately postpartum.  \n• Fluoroquinolones, cycloserine, paraaminosalicylic acid (PAS) and amoxicillin/clavulanate) \nshould be considered as the drug of choice when selecting drugs for MDR-TB treatment. \n• Injectable agents should be avoided. However, capreomycin may be considered in life \nthreatening situation due to MDR/XDR TB.  \n• Capreomycin thrice weekly from the start may be considered to decrease drug exposure \nto the foetus if an injectable agent need to be given. \n• Injectable agent may be given for three to six months postpartum even in the middle of \ntreatment but it is not necessary if the patient remain well and past eight months period \nfor injectable agent. \n• Ethionamide should be avoided due to risk of nausea and vomiting associated with \npregnancy, and potential teratogenic effects. \n• Termination of pregnancy should be considered if the mother’s life is compromised.4  \n• Treatment should be given for duration the same as for standard MDR-TB treatment. \n \n \n9.2 Breastfeeding \nTransmission of DR-TB during breast feeding may occur from the mother to the baby especially \nin smear positive cases.

DR-TB AND HIV INFECTION \n \nHIV is a significant risk factor for all forms of TB, both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant. The \npresence of HIV coinfection makes the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB more \nchallenging, especially in MDR- and XDR-TB. \n \nHIV infected patients are more likely to have smear-negative TB or extrapulmonary TB \n(including MDR-TB and XDR-TB). \nDR-TB is associated with higher mortality rates in the HIV-infected patients  \n \nEarly diagnosis of the DR-TB and HIV infection, prompt treatment with appropriate 2nd line anti-\nTB drugs, timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, strong infection control measures and good \nsocial support are all crucial components in management of DR-TB in people living with HIV. \n \nFor patients with advanced HIV disease, mycobacterial culture of sputum and other fluids \n(e.g. blood, pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid and bone-marrow aspirates) and \nhistopathology (e.g. lymph node biopsies) are helpful in diagnosis. \n \nART is recommended for all patients with HIV and DR TB requiring second-line anti-TB \ndrugs, irrespective of CD4 cell-count, as early as possible (within the first 8 weeks) following \ninitiation of anti-TB treatment                                                \n \nA common first line ART regime used in HIV infected patients with MDR-TB is AZT + 3TC + \nEFV. TDF is generally avoided due to the overlapping renal toxicity with the injectables, but AZT \n(anaemia) and d4T (peripheral neuropathy) have even more common side effects that may \nmake them unsuitable for some MDR- and XDR-TB patients. If TDF is used, additional \nmonitoring of renal function and electrolytes is indicated. \n \nImmune reconstitute inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an augmented inflammatory response \nthat occurs in patients commenced on HAART and anti-TB drugs. \nIRIS generally presents within three months of the initiation of ART and is more common \nwith a low CD4 cell count (<50 cells/mm3). \nThis syndrome can present as a paradoxical worsening of the patient’s clinical status                \n \nThe treatment of DR-TB in patients with HIV is very similar to that in patients without HIV, with \nthe following exceptions:  the need of ART and possibility of IRIS, the potential drug-drug \ninteraction between ART and anti-TB drugs and more frequent adverse effects requiring more \nintense monitoring.  \n \nPeople living with HIV need to be given the same consideration for treatment with the shorter \nMDR-TB treatment regimen as people who are HIV seronegative.  \n \nThe composition of the treatment regimen for MDR-TB does not differ for people living with HIV. \nHowever, thioacetazone should not be given to patients who are HIV positive; if it is being \nconsidered as part of a treatment regimen HIV infection needs to be reliably excluded in the \npatient.",

It also includes information on how the patient can protect \nhis/her family and household members from getting TB. Educating the patient should ultimately \nhelp the patient obtain better adherence.  \n \nPatient education takes place over several visits with different health care providers.

Inform patients that they must report any \nside effects of the medications immediately. \n• \nEducate the patient about monitoring requirements for smear, culture and laboratory \ntests.   \n• \nMake a follow-up plan for seeing the doctor and inform the patient if he/she has \nproblems they should be seen sooner. Make sure they know how to make an \nappointment if they need to be seen before the next routine visit. \n• \nInstruct patients what to do in case of an emergency (like severe shortness of breath). \n• \nEducate patients how DR-TB can be transmitted and some basics about household \ninfection control.

Managing \nadverse reaction is vital to ensure success to treatment. Ignoring patient’s compliant on adverse \ndrug effect will only leads to non-compliant and failure of treatment.  \n12.1 Monitoring for adverse effects during treatment \nClose monitoring of patients is necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of second-line anti-\nTB drugs are recognized quickly. All patients on second-line anti-TB drugs should be put under \nDOT. The major advantage of DOT is the ability to monitor adverse effect early, besides \nensuring compliance.  \nAll DOT providers should be trained to screen patients regularly for symptoms of common \nadverse effects. During each patient visit, a systematic method for screening of drugs adverse \nreaction should be done by DOT provider.

Prompt evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of adverse effects are \nimportant, even if the adverse effect is not particularly dangerous. Patients may have significant \nfear and anxiety about an adverse effect if they do not understand why it is happening. These \nemotions can result in non-compliance to treatment.  \nIf the adverse effect is mild and not dangerous, continuing the treatment regimen with the help \nof ancillary drugs if needed is often the best option. The adverse effects of a number of second-\nline drugs are highly dose dependent. Reducing the dosage of the offending drug is another \nmethod of managing adverse effects but only in cases where the reduced dose is still expected \nto produce adequate serum levels and not compromise the regimen. Lowering the dose by \nmore than one weight class should be avoided. \nTemporarily suspending the offending drug can be tried initially to alleviate adverse effects. The \noffending drug can be re-introduced later if needed, in smaller dose initially and slowly titrate up \nto optimal dose to improve tolerability.  \nSuspending permanently the offending drug may be the last option in dealing with serious \nadverse effect. Usually required replacement with another effective agent. However, a \nsatisfactory replacement may not be available, and this can resulting in lots of regimen efficacy, \nthus potentially treatment failure.  \nSome adverse effects may disappear or diminish with time, and patients may be able to \ncontinue receiving the drug if sufficiently motivated. \nPyridoxine (vitamin B6) should be given to all patients receiving cycloserine or terizidone to help \nprevent neurological adverse effects. The recommended dose is 50 mg for every 250 mg of \ncycloserine (or terizidone) prescribed.

The education can be provided by HCWs and the \nmaterials used are culturally-sensitive.   \n• DOT is a must in all DR-TB which can be provided by any trained and reliable supervisor \nin all settings. It should be patient and family friendly.  Strict confidentiality should be \nmaintained. \n• Socioeconomic problems should be addressed to enable patients and families to adhere \nwhich include enablers and incentives \n• Psychosocial and emotional support by multidisciplinary team should be offered to \novercome stigma and adverse effects of long term treatment \n• A workable system for monitoring and tracing for lost to follow up patient must be in place.  \nThe approach should be in a sympathetic and non-judgemental.   \n \nPatients with DR-TB are more likely to have history of non-adherence.

PALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CARE \nPatients who their second-line anti-TB have been stopped because of treatment failure still need \nto be alleviated of their suffering and prevent further transmission.  \n \n14.1 Approach to suspending therapy \n \nMedical therapy suspension is recommended when there are no more options of drugs to be \nprescribed and surgery is also not an option. \nThree considerations that then need to be considered are: \n• \nthe patient’s quality of life: Adverse effects from drugs of a failing regime may cause \nunnecessary suffering. \n• \nthe public health interest: Continuing a failing regime will create highly resistant strains \nthat will infect others. \n• \nthe model of care available: The available resources to provide palliative care and \ninfection control. \nA multi-disciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurses, DOT providers, patients and their \ncarers must come up with a plan that covers all the above. \n \n14.2 Palliative and end-of-life care for patients in whom all the possibilities of treatment \nhave failed \n \nPalliative care delivery can be delivered either in a hospital, palliative care units and patient’s \nhome. The benefits for MDR-TB patients to receive palliative care are that it: \n \n• provides relief from respiratory distress, pain and other symptoms; \n• affirms life and regards dying as a normal process; \n• intends neither to hasten nor to postpone death; \n• integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care; \n• offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death; \n• offers a support system to help the family cope during the patient’s illness and in their own \nbereavement; \n• uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including \nbereavement counselling, if indicated; \n• enhances quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness; and \n• is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with second-line anti-TB \nmedications, with the main therapy intended to prolong life through cure. \n \nSupportive care measures are summarized in Table 22. \n \n14.3 Infection control measures and domicile considerations for the end-of-life MDR-TB \npatient \nPatients whom treatment has been stopped remain infectious. Environmental and Personal \nProtection measures must be in place.  Particulate respirators (N95) masks must be used by \ncare givers and health care providers.",

Oxygen may be used to alleviate shortness of breath in some \ncases but there is no significant evidence to generalize its practice. Morphine provides \nsignificant relief from respiratory insufficiency and should be offered according to \nestablished clinical protocols available in the medical literature. \n• Relief from pain and other symptoms. Paracetamol, or codeine with paracetamol, \ngives relief from moderate pain. If possible, stronger analgesics, including morphine, \nshould be used when appropriate to keep the patient adequately comfortable. The WHO \nhas developed analgesic guides, pain scales and a three step “ladder” for pain relief. \n• Infection control measures. The patient who is taken off anti-TB treatment because of \nfailure often remains infectious. Infection control measures should be continued with \nreinforcement of environmental and personal measures, including N-95 mask use for \ncaregivers. \n• Nutritional support. Small and frequent meals are often best for a person at the end of \nlife. It should be accepted that the intake will reduce as the patient’s condition deteriorates \nand during end-of-life care. Nausea and vomiting or any other conditions that interfere \nwith nutritional support should be treated. \n• Regular medical visits. When MDR-TB treatment stops, regular visits by health-care \nproviders and the support team should be continued to address medical needs and \nensure that infection control practices are being followed. \n• Continuation of ancillary medicines. All necessary ancillary medications should be \ncontinued as needed. Codeine helps control cough, as well as pain. Other cough \nsuppressants can be added. Bronchospasms can be controlled with a metre-dosed \ninhaler with a spacer or mask. Depression and anxiety, if present, should be addressed. \nAntiemetic’s may still be needed and fever treated if the patient is uncomfortable. \n• Hospitalization, hospice care or nursing home care. Having a patient die at home can \nbe difficult for the family and the other way around. Home-based care should be offered to \npatients and families who want to keep the patient at home, whenever appropriate \ninfection control practices can be followed. Institutionally based end of- life care should be \navailable to those for whom home care is not feasible or desirable. Availability of \nrespiratory isolation facilities is essential when a patient is transferred to institutionally \nbased palliative care for medical reasons and the patient remains infectious. \n• Preventive measures. Oral care, prevention of bedsores, bathing and prevention of \nmuscle contractures are indicated in all patients. Regular scheduled movement of the \nbedridden patient is very important. Encourage patients to move their bodies in bed if \nable. Keeping beds dry and clean are also important. \n• Provide psychosocial support. Psychological counselling to the patient and family \ncaregivers is critical at this stage, especially to assist patients in the planning of decisions \nrelated with the end of life, and provide emotional support, especially in settings in which \nstrong stigma is attached to the disease. \n• Respect for patient’s beliefs and values at the end of life. It is common for the patient \nand family caregivers to develop or increase their interest in spiritual and religious matters \nonce they perceive that the end of life is approaching. The healthcare providers should \nrespect those beliefs and should not impose personal values and practices that prevent \nthe patient to seek and find comfort in the services delivered by faith-based organizations.",

MANAGEMENT OF CONTACTS OF MDR/ XDR-TB PATIENTS \nContacts of MDR/XDR-TB patient are defined as people living in the same household, \nworkplace or spending many hours a day together with the index case in the same indoor living \nspace. However there is no universal definition on duration of exposure for close contacts or \ncasual contact. Therefore, the operational definition for MDR/XDR-TB varies between regions, \ncountries and states. \n  \nClose contacts are likely to be infected because they have a long and frequent exposure with \ninfectious patient. They are also more likely to develop active TB because of their exposure.  \nThe investigation for the contacts of MDR/XDR-TB is to prevent the transmission of the resistant \nstrain either inside or outside the home or at workplace so that they can be treated immediately. \nIt also can provide the opportunity to educate the contacts about issues related to TB and \nMDR/XDR-TB  \n \nManagement of MDR/XDR-TB contacts should be integrated into the Programmatic \nManagement of MDR/XDR-TB. General considerations should be given to MDR/XDR-TB \ncontacts: \n• \nScreening for MDR-TB contact should be given high priority \n• \nScreening for XDR-TB contact should be considered as an emergency situation \n• \nAll contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patient should have a proper follow-up \n \nAll MDR/XDR-TB cases need urgent attention and therefore a structured programme for \nmanagement of case and their contacts should be in place to contain the disease \n(containment phase). \n \nClose contacts of MDR/XDR-TB are at high risk of being infected by the index case and \ndeveloping active TB. \n \n15.1 Management of contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patients \n \nAll contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patients must be identified promptly for evaluation of active TB \ndisease. Close contacts of MDR/XDR-TB should be screened more aggressive than among \nthose contacts of the drugs susceptible cases. Routine symptomatic and physical examination \nfor all MDR/XDR-TB contacts including asking about productive cough, haemoptysis, fever, loss \nof appetite, loss of weight, night sweat and other sign and symptom of TB. Rapid test for \nrifampicin resistant (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF) has a big role in contact management.  It should be \nconsidered if there is an access to the service because active case can be treated and \nmanaged promptly.  All close contacts must be followed up at least at intervals of 0, 3, 6, 12 \nmonths for two years (refer Figure 8). \n \nRecommendation 18 \n• All MDR/XDR-TB contacts should be put under surveillance for at least two years and \nevaluated for active TB regularly (0, 3, 6, 12 months interval). \n \nRecommendation 19 \n• Rapid test such as Xpert MTB/RIF is recommended for symptomatic MDR/XDR-TB \ncontact as an initial diagnostic test because it provides diagnosis of TB and Rifampicin \nResistant rapidly.",

From a drug management perspective, the health worker \nshould check that the patient knows at least the following about their treatment: \n• \nName of their TB medicines \n• \nNumber of tablets in one dose \n• \nNumber of doses to take per day \n• \nWhen to return to the TB centre for more medicines \n• \nNeed to report to the health care provider any adverse reactions that are encountered while \ntaking second-line anti-TB drugs. \n \nA structured pharmacovigilance system in the programme is encouraged to ensure patients’ \nsafety and proper management of any side effects. If adverse reactions are encountered, these \nshould be recorded in the patient’s case note and reported using the Adverse Drug Reaction \n(ADR) form.",

MANAGING DR-TB THROUGH PATIENT-CENTRED CARE \n \nMDR-TB often inflicts the poorest and most marginalized members of a society. Their quality of \nlife and financial situation are further aggravated by the disease, due to the adverse drug \nreactions produced by its treatment, the catastrophic costs they incur while seeking care and \nadhering to treatment and the stigma attached to the disease and subsequent discrimination.  \nThe delivery of social support services is important and runs parallel with the efforts to prevent \nand treat MDR-TB. \nSocial support may also contribute to improving the quality of life of patients. In many cases it \nalso makes a difference to enable the patient and family to access health care.  \nIn this chapter the patient-centred care approach to directly observation of therapy and the \nsocial support framework for programmatic management of drug-resistant TB are discussed. \n19.1 Patient-centred care and its role in DOT \nAdherence to DR- TB treatment is essential for cure. It is particularly difficult because of the \ncurrent lengthy recommended treatment regimens, the daily high pill burden, the frequent and \nserious drug adverse reactions, and the indirect social and economic costs to patients \nassociated with access to care. Thus, MDR-TB patients are at increased risk of poor adherence \nto treatment. \nThe patient-centred approach of the WHO TB strategy consists of enabling patients to exercise \ntheir rights and fulfil their responsibilities with transparency, respect and dignity, by giving due \nconsideration to their values and needs. This may increase the chances of successful treatment \noutcomes, and improve wellbeing and financial risk protection by improving adherence to \ntreatment, benefiting patients and society as a whole. \nGiven that MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treatment are often the last \ntherapeutic option for many patients and that there are serious public health consequences if \ntreatment fails, it is advisable that all patients receive medicines under DOT as a way to ensure \nfull adherence to treatment.  \nRecommendation 22 \n• \nPatient-centred approach to treatment should be developed for all patients in order to \npromote adherence and improve quality of life. This approach should be based on the \npatient’s needs and mutual respect between the patient and the provider. \n \n19.2 Social support in MDR-TB management  \nSocial support refers to the person’s perception and confirmation that he/she is part of a social \nnetwork that cares for him/her. A large body of evidence has confirmed that social support is a \npredictor of health status and mortality. Social support is determined by access to four \nresources: \ni. \nInformational support refers to any useful information that helps a person to solve \nproblems. \nii. \nEmotional support refers to all expressions of care that contribute to strengthen self-\nesteem through empathy, trust, encouragement and care, and helps with the \npsychological challenges in life.  \niii. \nCompanionship support refers to the help that makes a person feel that he or she \nbelongs to the social network, and that he or she can rely on it for certain needs.  \niv. \nFinancial support as assistance to deal with daily hurdles.",

Information and education interventions \nshould commence as soon as diagnosis is made and continue throughout the course of \ntreatment. Education can be provided by: physicians, nurses, community health workers and \nother health-care providers. Materials should be appropriate to the literacy levels of the patient \nand should be gender, age and culturally sensitive.  \nTips for delivering key information to the MDR-TB patient  \n• \nAlways use a venue that guarantees confidentiality in communication.  \n• \nUse language that reassures mutual respect and esteem between the patient, \ncaregivers and health-care providers.  \n• \nDo not make promises that the health-care service cannot keep.  \n• \nAvoid arguments and any discriminatory remarks for whatever conditions the patient \nhas. \n• \nRespect the patient’s right to choose. \n• \nTeach the patient how DR-TB can be transmitted (long exposure to contaminated air in \ncrowded conditions), how it cannot be transmitted (sexual relations, kisses, sharing \ncutlery and clothes, etc.), and teach the essentials about household infection control \nmeasures \n• \nWhile respecting patient’s religious beliefs explore proactively and clarify wrong notions \nthe patient may have about the disease and its treatment, especially those that may \nbecome barriers to adhere to treatment.  \n• \nEnable the patient to counteract stigma and discrimination by reassuring that his/ her \ndisease is not the result of any socially or morally inappropriate behaviour that he/she \nhas made in the past; and that many other patients have passed successfully through a \nsimilar experience \n \n19.2.2 Information support on MDR-TB treatment  \nThere should be a well-formulated plan for preparing the patient for treatment. This includes \neducating the patient and caretaker on the use of drugs, length of treatment, possible side \neffects, and mechanisms to access support that will be available to the patient. Patient \ninformation and education takes place over several visits with different health-care providers \n(from the DOT provider to the physician). Information and educational pamphlets with reminders \nof the main points, in the local language, are helpful.",

If at a hospital, estimate the approximate length of \ntime. If at home, ask about the home living situation and whether or not the patient feels \nhome treatment will be possible. \n• Teach the patient about the drugs in general terms: i.e. there are at least five different \nanti-TB drugs, which the patient will take, of which one is an injectable agent. Try to \nteach the names of the drugs and show what the pills look like. \n• Teach the patient about possible side effects and the actions to take once detected, \nincluding reporting to the DOT provider, especially those with serious consequences \nlike any hearing loss, ringing in the ears or suicidal ideation. \n• Teach the patient about monitoring requirements for smear, culture and laboratory tests \nfor early detection of side effects.  \n• Make sure that patients and caregivers know how to make an appointment if they need \nto be seen before the next routine visit.  \n• Make sure they know that the DOT provider can contact a doctor urgently at any time of \nthe day.  \n• Instruct them what to do in case of an emergency (like severe shortness of breath, \nseizure, etc.)  \n• Always provide a copy of the TB Patient Charter, informing the patients about their \nrights and responsibilities related with the treatment and prevention and control of TB;  \n• Inform patient and family caregivers on social support and social protection options the \npatient is eligible for according to the existing law in the country, including palliative and \nend-of-life care as needed. \n \n19.2.3 Emotional support \nHaving MDR-TB can be an emotionally devastating experience for patients and their social \nnetworks. Considerable stigma is attached to the disease, and this may interfere with adherence \nto therapy, and may badly affect the quality of life of patients in view of the discrimination that \nfollows stigma.  \nThe provision of emotional support services to patients may increase the likelihood of therapy \nadherence, and the acquisition of skills to deal with stigma and discrimination. This support may \nbe organized in the form of support groups or in one-to one counselling by trained providers.  \nInformal support can also be provided by physicians, nurses, DOT providers, drug-resistant TB \nsupporters and family members. The establishment of support groups may allow patients with \ndrug-resistant TB to meet and socialize with other patients and provide emotional support to \neach other. \nPsychological support to MDR-TB patients through peer-to-peer and group support  \n• A counsellor, social worker or someone trained in facilitating support groups should \nfacilitate the meeting.  A trained drug-resistant TB community nurse or health worker \nmay co-facilitate the group \n• Clear eligibility criteria should be created for participation in each support group:     \n• Participation should be generally reserved for patients who are sputum negative and are \nno longer infectious, especially if the meeting cannot take place in an open space.",

Most commonly, this system will involve \nthe drug-resistant TB clinic or community nurse, doctor or supervisor assisting the drug-resistant \nTB DOT supporter by visiting the patient’s home the same day to find out why the patient has \ndefaulted and ensure that treatment is resumed promptly and effectively. The situation should \nbe addressed in a sympathetic, friendly and non-judgmental manner. Every effort should be \nmade to listen to the patient’s reasons for missing a dose(s) and to work with the patient and the \nfamily to ensure continuation of treatment. \nThe following steps should be taken for patients showing any signs of possible poor adherence: \n• \nHome visit by the health-care provider involved in the drug-resistant TB programme: The \ndrug-resistant TB clinic or community nurse, doctor or supervisor should visit the home of \nthe patient together with, or in addition to, the drug-resistant TB DOT supporter, as during \nthe home visit it may be possible to identify more clinical problems than during the monthly \nclinic evaluation.  \n• \nManage side effects: This is one of the most common reasons for the MDR-TB patient to be \nlost to follow-up.  \n• \nCounselling: The patient may no longer want to continue treatment because he/she feels \nbetter, and therefore, feels treatment is no longer necessary. Additionally, the patient’s \nperspective about his/her care should be assessed. The patient may have greater \nconfidence in alternative or folk medicine. If this is the case, the drug-resistant TB DOT \nsupporter, along with a nurse, doctor or community supervisor, should explore ways in \nwhich to meet the patient’s needs, all the while putting them back on treatment. \n• \nAddress economic problems: Many patients are unable to work when they are ill, and may \nbe the primary wage earners for their family. An assessment related to basic housing, food \nand clothing needs should be explored and ways to assist with these issues addressed.  \n• \nAddress addiction or other social problems: Alcohol consumption and drug abuse are known \nissues, which affect treatment adherence. Patients should be encouraged to stop or \ndecrease consumption. \n• \nInvolve the family: Family is the most important source of psychosocial support for the \npatient. When a patient has no family, have the patient identify a person who can act as a \ncaregiver.  \n• \nInvolve community leaders: Community and religious leaders can be helpful if there are \ncommunity-wide issues, such as stigma towards drug-resistant TB patients. This option is \nnot always available if the patient desires to keep his or her health status confidential.",
