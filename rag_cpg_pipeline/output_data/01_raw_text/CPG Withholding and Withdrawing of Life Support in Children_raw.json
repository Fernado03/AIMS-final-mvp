The increased ability to sustain life with intensive care\nmay lead, unfortunately, sometimes only to prolonging suffering when treatment is\nunsuccessful, and prolonging the dying process, attached to technology, instead of\ndying with dignity in the company of loved ones. Thus, with these new technologies\nalso comes the responsibility to understand how, when, and why these technologies\nare applied, and when technology should not be used or withdrawn.\nProfessionals have a duty to act in their patients’ best interests, to sustain life and\nrestore health to an acceptable standard (Chantler & Doyal, 2000, Level 9). However,\nit is important both from an ethical as well as an economic viewpoint, for these\nprofessionals to recognise the limits of unnecessary prolongation of life. Furthermore,\nrecognition that resources are finite, limit the provision of care that is deemed futile.\nThe decision by a doctor to withhold or withdraw treatment, but not care, (please\nsee Appendix 1 for definition of terms) from a patient may result in a serious conflict\nwith a parent who insists otherwise. However, this may be ethically justifiable and\nlegally defensible under certain circumstances, since doctors are morally obliged to\nquestion if providing treatment is inconsistent with his professional ethics. The\ndecision to withhold or withdraw treatment can be made on the basis that treatment\nis contrary to the child’s best interests, disproportionately burdensome, futile, or\neven harmful (Larcher & Hird 2002, Level 9; Schneiderman et al, 1996, Level 9).\n2.\nMETHODOLOGY\nA systematic search of the literature using PubMed, Proquest, Ovid, and Ebsco was\ncarried out. The key words used included withdrawal, withholding, limitation, life-\nsustaining therapy, life support, treatment, children, neonate, intensive care, paediatric\nintensive care, ethical, cost, and financial implication, used singly or in combination.\nThe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Evidence Based Medicine\nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews (DARE) were also searched. Additional literature\nsearch was carried out using the words nutrition and hydration.",

            "text": "3.\nREASONS FOR WITHDRAWAL/WITHOLDING LIFE SUPPORT\n3.1.\nNeonates\nDecisions relating to the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining medical\ntreatments are a necessary part of a neonatal unit’s practice (Larcher & Hird\n2002, Level 9). Many decisions regarding life support call for the use of ‘best\ninterests’ standard, involving weighing the benefits and burdens of life-\nsustaining medical treatment (please see Appendix 1 for the range of LSMT).\nThe benefits include the following:\n•\nProlongation of life (understanding that the continuation of biological\nexistence without consciousness may not be a benefit)\n•\nImproved quality of life (including reduction of pain or disability)\n•\nIncreased physical pleasure, emotional enjoyment and intellectual\nsatisfaction.\nThe burden of life sustaining medical treatment (LSMT) may include the\nfollowing\n•\nIntractable pain\n•\nIrremediable disability or helplessness\n•\nEmotional, psychosocial and economic suffering\n•\nInvasive and/or inhumane interventions that severely detract from the\npatient’s quality of life (i.e. experience of life as viewed by the patient,\nand not social worth as judged by others) (Meisel, 1989, Level 9)\n3.1.1. Labour room/ operation theatre\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation in the labour room presents clinicians with\nsignificant ethical issues. The resuscitation of critically ill infants is a difficult\nchoice and decision of whether to resuscitate or not must often be made\nrapidly. Generally, it is recommended that if there is any doubt, resuscitative\nefforts should be provided, since it allows time for increased prognostic\ncertainty and opportunity for joint decision-making (Meadow et al, 1996, Level 8).\nResuscitation may be inappropriate for the following:\n•\nExtremely low birth weight  - gestation <23 weeks or birth weight\n<400gm\n•\nNeonate with severe congenital defects  e.g. anencephaly\n•\nSevere perinatal asphyxia e.g. persistent asystole for >15 min.\n(Niermeyer et al 2000 Level 9; Goldsmith et al, 1996, Level 8)\n3.1.2. Neonatal Intensive Care Units\nIn UK, withdrawal of treatment accounts for up to 30% of neonatal intensive\ncare deaths (Wall & Partridge, 1997, Level 8). In USA, according to the Baby\nDoe regulations (1985) doctors must treat all infants with life-threatening\nconditions, except in the following situations  (Lantos et al 1994, Level 8):\n•\nInfant is chronically and irreversibly comatose\n2",

The long-\nterm implications of clinical findings such as the following:\n•\nbilateral cerebral intraparenchymal haemorrhage\n•\ndiffuse periventricular leukomalacia\n•\nsevere perinatal asphyxia with grade III hypoxic-ischaemic\nencephalopathy have been established as having poor prognosis, the\nneurodevelopmental outlook in many other situations is often not clear\n(Larcher & Hird 2002, Level 9). Thus, while reasons for withholding or\nwithdrawal may vary, these will fall into the following 2 categories:\na.\nNo chance for survival (Cook & Watchko,  1996, Level 8; Caniano et\nal 1995, Level 8) or continued treatment futile in the face of\nimminent death (Cuttini et al 2000, Level 8; Caniano et al 1995, Level 8)\n•\nLimited life expectancy\n-\nEnd of treatment line-death inevitable (Kelly et al 1994, Level 8)\n-\nLesion incompatible with life (Kelly et al 1994, Level 8)\n-\nPoor chance of survival (Hazebroek et al 1993, Level\n8;  Whitelaw,1986, Level 8)\n•\nInevitable dependency on life-sustaining treatment\n-\nLesion will not allow meaningful survival (Kelly et al 1994, Level\n8) or poor prognosis for later life (Hazebroek et al 1993, Level 8)\n•\nImpossibility that the infant would ever go home\n(daCosta et al 2002, Level 8 ; Van der Heide et al 1998, Level 9;\nWall & Partridge 1997, Level 8;  Van der Heide et al. 1997,de\nLeeuw et al 1996,  Level 8 ; Level 8 ; Lantos et al 1994, Level 8 )\nb.\nQuality of life issues (Cook & Watchko et al 1996, Level 8; Hazebroek\net al 1993, Level 8)\nExpected poor quality of life/severe disabilities or severely\ndeforming and incapacitating condition with little or no hope of\nachieving meaningful ‘humanhood’ (Cuttini et al 1999, Level 9; Fost\n1999, Level 9)\n•\nSevere brain damage when death may be preferable to life (Kelly\net al 1994, Level 8)\n•\nNo prospects for improvement\n3",

Futility of care\nWith patient autonomy, some patients and their families claim the right to receive\nany aggressive high tech medical interventions on a chance of improving\nsurvival, even if the medical provider judges the treatment to be futile.\nFutility refers to whether treatment will benefit an individual patient\n(Schneiderman et al, 1996, Level 9), and is an increasingly common\njustification for refusing to provide treatment requested (Prendergast 1995,\nLevel 9). Nelson (1995, Level 9) suggest that futile be restricted to judgments\nof “strict futility” and to use disproportionate burden when a doctor judges\nthat the burden of continued treatment for the child far outweighs any expected\nbenefit.\nStrict futility or physiologic futility is when a certain treatment fails to preserve\na physiologic function vital for survival, resulting in imminent death e.g.  the\nadministration of vasopressors that fails to maintain an adequate blood\npressure following a cardiac arrest. The doctor is not ethically or legally bound\nto offer or provide it, regardless of patient or parental wishes.\n5",

            "text": "Disproportionate burden involves value judgment about the benefits and\nburdens of continued treatment. Treatment will not benefit the patient, causes\npain and suffering, and does not contribute to restoring acceptable quality of\nlife, although the patient may survive for years. The doctor may be justified in\nrefusing to provide that treatment despite parental disagreement, but foregoing\ntreatment should not be the doctor’s decision alone unless death is imminent.\nHowever, it has been shown that few paediatric intensive care beds were used\nfor futile care (Goh & Mok, 2001, Level 8; Sachdeva et al, 1996, Level 8).\n4.\nINTENSIVE CARE IN THE CRITICALLY ILL CHILD\nInjudicious application of intensive care i.e. mechanical ventilation, dialysis and\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may create a clinical scenario in which a patient\ncan be maintained alive in an ICU setting with burdensome therapy, never entering\na conscious state, survive and be discharged home with an unacceptable quality of\nlife, or when therapy is failing, deprive another patient who has a chance of a more\nmeaningful survival if given access to the ICU.\nSome questions one should consider when making decisions on whether to admit a\ncritically ill patient with cancer to the ICU or to institute CPR are:\n1.\nIs there a chance of the disease being cured, controlled or put into remission,\nand a meaningful life?\n2.\nIs autonomy of patient respected?\n3.\nIs there distributive justice? Patient with the best chance of benefiting from\nintensive therapy should receive priority for admission.\nAustralian Classification system for cancer provides a framework to discuss goals\nof care relative to cancer status (Meadow et al 1996, Level 9)\nAs healthcare costs continue to increase economic analysis will be necessary to\nguide resource allocation decisions. Cost effectiveness analysis is the most popular\nand it evaluates the effectiveness of one treatment versus another. In end-of-life\nissues the perspective needs to be broad and include all those who gain as well as\nthose who pay (ATS Bioethics Task Force 1997; Level 9).\nThe value of the health consequence is usually reported as a quality of adjusted life\nyear (QALY). QALY is simply the weighted average of the value of a health related\nquality of life where death is 0 and optimum health is 1. This assumption may not\nhold true when considering terminally ill patients.\n6",

However, perceptions about the child’s best interest may differ, and ‘best\ninterest’ may not be synonymous with prolongation of life.\nThose with parental responsibility for a child are legally and morally entitled to give\nor withhold consent to treatment, unless they conflict seriously with the interpretation\nof those providing care in the child’s best interests. According to the Child Act 2001,\nparents can lose their rights and the child taken into protection, if parents object to\nthe child’s needs to be examined, investigated or treated for the purpose of restoring\nor preserving his health. Although a child under 18 years of age with a sufficient\nlevel of competence and understanding can give valid consent to treatment, he/she\nhowever cannot refuse to have life saving treatment.\nIn general, doctors judge the clinical factors, and parents determine best interests\nof the child.  If there is a disagreement that cannot be resolved, a Court may determine\nwhether the provision of life-prolonging treatment would benefit the child.\n6.\nECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS\n6.1.\nCost Implications of End-of-Life Care\nIt has been shown that end-of-life care consumes 10-12% of all health care\nexpenditures. For terminally ill patients, significant cost savings can be achieved\nwith the use of hospice, and the lower use of high technology interventions.\nInitiation of renal support such as dialysis as well as CPR in critically ill patients\nhas been found not to be cost effective. The cost effectiveness of palliative\ntherapies is difficult to calculate since there is no good measure for valuing\nthe quality of death.\n6.2.\nCare of Extremely Low Birth Weight Babies\nExtremely low birth weight (ELBW) babies require expensive and scarce\nresources, having poor prognosis for survival should they require intensive\ncare. Intensive care is costly and outcomes are often uncertain, and hence,\nrationing of these resources is inevitable. Neonatal intensive care mortality\ndecreases as the birth weight increases, so that most NICU deaths occur\nduring the first few days leaving a relatively healthier population with greater\nlikelihood of survival (Meadow et al 1996, Level 9). Since premature ELBW\nbabies result in early deaths, the policy is to initiate treatment on most babies\nto see who will do well and who will develop life-threatening complications\n(Peabody 1996, Level 9). However, many studies have shown aggressive\n7",

Treating them over-vigorously\nviolates the moral principles of non-maleficence and distributive justice.\nSimilarly, failing to treat vigorously due to concerns regarding non-maleficence\nand distributive justice could violate the principle of patient-centered\nbeneficence. Distributive justice compels the doctor to allocate finite resources\nequitably (Young & Stevenson 1990, Level 9; Pronovost & Angus 2001, Level 9).\n7.\nWITHDRAWAL OR WITHHOLDING LIFE SUPPORT IN PRACTICE\nThe practical issues for withdrawal in neonates and children are similar in many\nrespects and will be discussed together, unless indicated otherwise! The term “child”\ndesignates both neonates and children.\n7.1\nThe decision to withdraw life support\nIn principle the decision on when to withdraw life support is made by the attending\nconsultant paediatrician with the assistance of the whole team (colleagues,\nmedical officers, nursing personnel) and in consultation with parents.\n7.2\nPre-Withdrawal Preparation\n1.\nIt is important that the decision to withdraw life support is a team effort\nin which the parents are fully involved. The decision should first be\ndiscussed with personnel involved in the care of the child. It should\nthen be discussed with the parents before a final decision is made.\n2.\nIf a parent (e.g. mother post LSCS) has not seen the child since\nadmission, attempts should be made for that parent to see the child\nbefore the actual withdrawal is done.\n3.\nFor continuity and trust, it is important that the attending team -\nconsultant paediatrician, medical officer and nurse be present to see\nthe parents through the whole process: pre-withdrawal, withdrawal\nand post-withdrawal counseling.\n4.\nThe attending consultant paediatrician (or most senior member of the team),\nmedical officer and nurse should discuss the following with the parents:\na.\nThe timing of the procedure - the date and time of the actual withdrawal\nshould be decided by the parents (within reasonable limits).\nb. What the procedure entails - care should be taken to indicate how\nlong the breathing might continue, that the child may have gasping\nrespiration, that sedation may be used if the child in anyway\nappears to suffer.\n8",

Removing all invasive lines except the endotracheal tube. Just\nprior to this it may be wise to give sedation (e.g. a morphine purge\nto limit the trauma of gasping). Alternatively, it is possible to keep\none heparinised IV line in case of need for sedation.\nb. Cleaning any blood or fluid stains on skin if necessary.\nc.

            "text": "Appendix 1\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n1.\nBenefit versus burden of care: The primary goal of medical treatment is to\nbenefit the patient by restoring and maintaining the patient’s health as far as\npossible, maximising benefit and minimising harm. However, sometimes the\ncourse of the disease may cause health professionals and the child’s family\nto consider whether continued treatment truly represents the best option.  If\ntreatment fails to provide a net benefit to the patient, it no longer becomes\nappropriate to prolong life at all costs, with no regard to its quality or the\nburdens of treatment. In such circumstances there is justification, ethically\nand legally, for withholding or withdrawing treatment. The goal of medicine\nshould then shift to palliative care.\n2.\nWithholding and withdrawing: The term “forgo” is synonymously used for\nboth stopping a treatment already begun (“withdraw”) as well as not starting\na treatment (“withhold”). Other terms include “limitation of treatment” (Goh et\nal 1999). There is no important ethical or legal difference between withholding\nor withdrawing treatment when making decisions about an individual patient\n(AAP guidelines 1994). Yet, many health care professionals, as well as\nfamilies, feel an emotional difference between the two, largely due to the\nimpression that withdrawing treatment can be interpreted as “giving up on\nthe patient”. Some health professionals may be reluctant to start treatment in\nthe mistaken belief that once started the treatment cannot be withdrawn.\nTreatment should never be withheld, especially when there is a chance the\npatient may benefit, simply because withholding is considered easier than\nwithdrawing. When great uncertainty prevails, a better course would be to\ninitiate treatment to ascertain whether it is able to benefit the patient, and\nsubsequently withdraw it if it proves unhelpful.\n3.\nLife-sustaining medical treatment (LSMT): Other terms commonly used\ninclude “life prolonging treatment” and “life support”. It encompasses ALL\ninterventions that may prolong the life of the patient and postpone death.\nThere is evidence that if these interventions are withdrawn or withheld, death\nusually ensues (Goh et al, 1999; and Wall et al, 1997) There is no difference\nbetween “extraordinary” (technically demanding and often scarce) and\n“ordinary” interventions. However, in reality, health care professionals have\nmany preferences and biases regarding the type and order of withdrawal of\nsuch treatment. In light of these subconscious biases, it is useful to review\nthe wide range of LSMT and work towards an approach focusing on the unique\nsituation and needs of the patient rather than physician preferences.\n15",

            "text": "4.\nArtificial nutrition and hydration: refers specifically to those techniques for\nproviding nutrition or hydration that bypass the normal swallowing process. It\nis now accepted that providing nutrition and hydration via tube or intravenously\nconstitutes a medical treatment (AAP guidelines, 1994). Evidence suggests\nthat neither nutrition nor hydration in terminally ill patients increases the\ncomfort or quality of life, and may in fact exacerbate discomfort and suffering\n(American Dietetic Association, 2002). In these situations the goal is to provide\ncomfort, not adequate nutrition. Good practice should include moistening\ntheir mouths as necessary to keep them comfortable. There are three major\ncategories in which it is ethically permissible to forgo artificial nutrition in\nchildren: neurological devastation, irreversible total intestinal failure and\nimminent death from any cause (Nelson, 1995). However, it is recognized\nthat many health professionals and families are emotionally uncomfortable\nwith forgoing artificial nutrition and hydration, on the premise that feeding\nchildren is the most basic aspect of care. Discussions with the family about\nthe consequences of forgoing artificial nutrition and their beliefs and\npreferences are necessary. Informed and shared decision making is the best\nethical practice, but respect for the opinion of the family is paramount.\n5.\nBrain death: Denotes the irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain,\nincluding the brain stem. There should be no confusion over the concept and\ndefinition of brain death - a child who is brain dead is dead. It is a legally\ndefined state that does not require agreement or consent from the family\n(Report of Special Task Force (1987). Discontinuing technologic support for\na brain dead patient is not an issue, and is distinctly different from the issues\nof withdrawing or withholding LMST in a patient who has an extremely poor\nprognosis for survival but does not meet the criteria for brain death.\n6.\nPalliative care: sometimes referred to as “end of life care”. When cure or\nrecovery is no longer possible, the focus must shift to ensuring that the patient\nhas a “good death”, with relief from pain and suffering. Both humanistic and\ntechnical skills are required to ensure that the needs of the child and family\nare met. However, patients and their families do not suddenly switch from the\nhope of survival to the acceptance of death and pursuit of comfort. This process\noccurs gradually over varying periods of time, ranging from hours to weeks,\ndepending on the clinical situation. Similarly, forgoing LSMTs rarely happens\nall at once and is likewise a gradual process that parallels the shift in goals.\nIt should be emphasized that palliative care and LSMT are not mutually\nexclusive options but rather coexistent.\n17",

Aegyptus decided that his fifty sons\nwould marry Danaus’ fifty daughters.
