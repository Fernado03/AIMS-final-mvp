Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy. The inclusion criterion was all adults with gout. The search \nwas limited to literature published in the last 13 years, on humans and \nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify \nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 12 November \n2019 to 30 June 2021. Literature search was repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 30 June 2021 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other guidelines as listed below: \n•\t 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guideline for the \nManagement of Gout\n•\t 2016 updated European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) \nevidence-based recommendations for the management of gout\n•\t The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) Guideline for the \nManagement of Gout (2017)\n•\t 2018 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the \ndiagnosis of gout\n•\t 2012 ACR Guidelines for Management of Gout.

            "text": "1\nManagement of Gout (Second Edition)\n1.\t INTRODUCTION\nThe early records of gout by the Egyptians dated back to 2640 before \ncommon era (BCE). The disease was also described by Hippocrates \nin the fifth BCE.1 Despite being one of the oldest joint diseases, its \nprevalence and incidence seem to be increasing globally.2 Gout is \nassociated with an increase in all-cause mortality, chronic disability, \nimpairment of health-related quality of life, higher usage of health care \nservices and reduced productivity.3 In many countries, the outcomes \nof the disease are far from favourable due to suboptimal management. \nCommonly, only a third to half of patients with gout receive urate-\nlowering therapy (ULT) and fewer than a half of them adhere to \ntreatment.2 A study in a rheumatology centre in Malaysia reported that \nonly 34.9% of its patients achieved the recommended serum urate \n(SU) target. Nonadherence was the main reason for failure to attain \nthe target.4 \nThe first edition of this CPG was published in 2008 by the Malaysian \nSociety of Rheumatology. Since then, there have been advances in \nthe understanding of the risk factors, diagnostic techniques, treatment \nstrategy and options, and comorbidities of the disease. The employment \nof the treat-to-target (T2T) concept represents an important milestone in \ngout management. By bringing SU to <360 µmol/L, crystals are dissolved \nand this suggests that gout is potentially a ‘curable’ disease. However, \nULT which is the cornerstone of therapy needs to be maintained long-\nterm to prevent new crystal formation. The reversibility of the process \nis a unique feature of gout, in contrast with other rheumatic conditions. \nNevertheless, if joint destruction has set in, damage is permanent. \nOf equal significance is the evolving science regarding risk factors \ne.g. obesity and high-fructose corn syrup. Obesity is thought to be \na contributing factor in the rising prevalence and incidence of gout.2 \nHigh-fructose corn syrup increases risk of incident gout. On the other \nhand, plant-derived high purine diet does not.5 Non-invasive imaging \nmodalities e.g. ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography \n(DECT) have improved the diagnostic armamentarium of gout. There \nis new development on the use of allopurinol. The recommendation is \nto ‘start low, go slow’ when initiating and titrating it to achieve target, \nespecially in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease (CKD). \nThe discovery of febuxostat, which is a non-purine xanthine oxidase \ninhibitor (XOI) widens the choice of ULT for prescribers. Combination \ntherapy further expands treatment options. Last but not least, the role \nof education for health care professionals and patients is important too. \nWithout proper knowledge and understanding, all the above progress \nwill not be implemented successfully. Misconceptions and lack of \nknowledge of the disease among both parties are barriers to effective \nmanagement of the disease.6 Therefore an updated version of the CPG \nis timely.",

The first gout flare is preceded by a period \nof asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and MSU crystal deposition. It is self-\nlimiting and lasts about 1 - 2 weeks. This acute episode is followed by \ncomplete resolution of symptoms and signs of joint inflammation, which \nthen enters a quiet interval called intercritical gout. If hyperuricaemia \npersists, the result is recurrent flares. Their occurrences gradually \nbecome more frequent and prolonged with multiple joint involvement \n(polyarticular gout), including those of the upper limbs. If hyperuricaemia \nremains uncontrolled, chronic gouty arthritis with or without tophi \nformation can ensue later, on an average of 10 years after initial \nsymptom onset. \nIt is important to note that not all individuals with hyperuricaemia \ndevelop asymptomatic MSU crystal deposition or gout.

Several \nfactors may affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. \n17.1\t Facilitating and Limiting Factors \nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG \ninclude: \n•\t availability of CPG to health care providers (hard copies and soft \ncopies/online)\n•\t regular seminar/conference/course for health care providers \non management of gout including those involving professional \nbodies (e.g. Malaysian Society of Rheumatology)\n•\t public awareness activities during World Arthritis Day\n•\t involvement of governmental/non-governmental organisations \ne.g. Malaysian Society of Rheumatology and Arthritis Foundation \nof Malaysia\n•\t accessibility to relevant multidisciplinary teams\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n•\t limited awareness and understanding/knowledge in management \nof gout among health care providers\n•\t variation in clinical management and preferences\n•\t insufficient resources in terms of budget, expertise, access to \ndiagnostic tests and medications (gout placed at low priority by \nstakeholders)\n•\t misconception about the disease and its management by the \npublic\n•\t no national registry on gout\n17.2\t Potential Resource Implications\nT2T strategy is an important concept in gout management. However, \nmany clinicians especially those in the primary care may not know and \nunderstand it. T2T strategy entails proper investigations and treatment \nof gout patients so that crippling chronic gouty arthritis, disabling \ncomorbidities, poor quality of life and premature death can be minimised \nor even avoided. \nIn T2T strategy, more visits and frequent blood investigations are \nrequired to ensure SU level of <360 µmol/L is achieved. This can be \ndone by a dedicated team in both primary and secondary care. It should \ninclude trained allied health care professionals. They can also provide \nregular health education (pathogenesis and natural course of disease, \nlifestyle modification, diet and exercise as well as the importance of",
