There was active \ninvolvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the \nprocess of the CPG development.\nThe CPG update was done based on the first edition of evidence-\nbased CPG on Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in \nAdults, issued in 2011. In the update, certain methodology was used \ne.g. GRADE principles, and the scope expanded/added on risk factors, \nclassification, treatment, pregnancy and complications (e.g. anaemia \nand CKD-Mineral Bone Disease). Dietary interventions and lifestyle \nmodification were not included. A literature search was carried out \nusing the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and \nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and \nGuidelines International Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of \nSearch Strategy). The search was limited to literature published in the \nlast four years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference \nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further \nidentify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to \nidentify further studies. All searches were conducted from 13 May 2016 \nto 10 October 2016. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31 December 2017 to be included. \nFuture CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off \ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request \nfrom the CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were made to other CPGs on CKD e.g.\n•\t KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and \nManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease (Kidney Disease: Improving \nGlobal Outcomes CKD Work Group, 2013)\n•\t Chronic kidney disease in adults: assessment and management \n(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2014)\n•\t Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Management in General Practice \n(3rd Edition) (Kidney Health Australia, 2015)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as references.\nA total of 11 main clinical questions were developed under four \ndifferent sections (screening, treatment, referral and CKD-related \ncomplications). Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 19 times throughout the development of \nv",

All literature retrieved were appraised by at least \ntwo DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, \npresented in evidence tables and further discussed in DG meetings. \nAll statements and recommendations subsequently formulated were \nagreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, \nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. \nThis CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-\nanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of \nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG strictly \nfollows the requirement of AGREE II. \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external \nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website\nfor feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally \npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the\nHTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

If CKD is detected early and managed \nappropriately, the deterioration in kidney function can be reduced by as \nmuch as 50%.6 Lifestyle changes, initiation of Angiotensin-Converting \nEnzyme Inhibitor (ACEi) or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) are \nproven interventions to delay renal disease progression and also \nreduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.\nIn Taiwan, the prevalence of CKD was estimated to be 11.9% while \nawareness was only 3.5%.7 After the introduction of a nationwide CKD \nPreventive Project in 2001, consisting of screening high-risk populations, \npatient education and multidisciplinary team care, the prevalence rate \nwas greatly reduced and the annual growth rate of patients requiring \ndialysis decreased from 6% to 3%.8 This is a successful CKD prevention \nprogramme that can be emulated in Malaysia.\nEarly detection at primary care and timely intervention are important \nstrategies in delaying CKD progression. Shared decision making and \nclose collaboration between different levels of healthcare should \nbe implemented in the management of CKD locally.\nThe aim of this CPG is to provide an evidence-based guidance \nfor healthcare providers to screen for CKD and commence early \ninterventions to ameliorate or even halt the progression of CKD. It can \nalso be used as a reference for the relevant stakeholders when forming \npublic health plans for comprehensive CKD management.",

Thus, the recommendations in this CPG are mainly adapted \nfrom pre-existing international CPGs.  \nRecommendation 13\n•\t In chronic kidney disease (CKD), screening for:\n○ anaemia should be done when estimated Glomerular Flitration \nRate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2\n○ CKD-mineral and bone disorder when eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 \n8.1\t Anaemia\nAnaemia is defined as a Hb concentration of <13 g/dL in adult males \nand <12 g/dL in adult females.12, 65\nRenal anaemia is a common complication of CKD due to reduced \nerythropoietin production by the kidney and reduced absorption of iron. \nIt usually starts to develop when the eGFR is <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The \nprevalence of anaemia increases markedly with decreasing eGFR.61 \nWhen the eGFR is ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2, the anaemia is more likely to be \nrelated to other causes.66\nIron deficiency and other causes of anaemia e.g. vitamin B12 and \nfolate deficiency, bone marrow suppression, hypothyroidism and \nhaemoglobinopathies should be excluded during the work-up for renal \nanaemia.12, 61, 67 \nThe frequency of Hb monitoring is influenced by kidney function (refer \nto Table 6), underlying disease process, initial Hb concentration and \nrate of change in Hb concentration.12, 65",
