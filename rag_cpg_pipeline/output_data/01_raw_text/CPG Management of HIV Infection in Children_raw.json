INTRODUCTION\nBy the end of 2006 there were estimated 2.3 million children globally below\n15 years of age living with HIV with an estimated half a million new\ninfections occurring in children for the year 2006.1 In addition, of the\nestimated 10 000 new infections that occurred daily worldwide among adults\nin 2006, 50% were among women.\nIn Malaysia, the cumulative number of reported cases of HIV infection at end\n2006 was 76 389 with 5830 reported cases for 2006. While women constituted\nonly 1.16% of total new cases for 1990, this increased to 15.0% for 2006.\nChildren below of age 12 years of age constituted 1.5% of total reported cases\nfor 2006, those aged 13-19 years 1.0% and those aged 20-29 years 2.7%.2\nThe vast majority of paediatric HIV infections are acquired vertically.\nEstimates from studies of prevention of mother-to-child transmission\n(PMTCT) suggest that in non-breastfeeding populations, about 50% of all\nHIV infections occur in the days before delivery and during labour and\nanother third occur during late labour and actual passage through the birth\ncanal.\nIn breastfeeding populations, postnatal exposure could account for 40% of\nall transmissions. Studies suggest that transmission risk in infants who are\nexclusively breastfed is half that of infants who are given mixed feeding.3\nMalaysia introduced antenatal counselling and testing for HIV in 1998 and\nutilized the Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) 076 protocol for\nits PMTCT programme. From its introduction to the end of 2006, almost 3\nmillion pregnant women were screened, representing 99.5% coverage of all\nrecorded pregnancies. The prevalence of HIV-1 infection among pregnant\nwomen has remained an average of 0.036% over this time with an estimated\naverage perinatal transmission rate of 3.7% (median 3.95%)2.\nIn developed countries, the number of children of HIV positive mothers\nnewly infected with HIV has decreased dramatically with a perinatal\ntransmission rate of <1% - a result of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and\nthe use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for pregnant HIV\ninfected mothers, the selection of lower risk delivery practices, neonatal\nARV prophylaxis, and lower risk approaches to infant feeding.\nAlthough studies and advances in the management of HIV infection among\nchildren and adolescents have lagged behind those in adults, there have\nbeen substantial advances in the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment and\nmonitoring of children exposed to and infected with HIV-1.",

Major online references are provided and the\nreader is advised to look these up to obtain the latest data and information\non advances in HIV in children and adolescents.\nThis CPG addresses two broad clinical areas.\n•\nThe management of the infant with perinatal exposure to HIV infection\n•\nThe management of HIV infection in children and adolescents.\n2.\nMANAGEMENT OF THE PERINATALLY EXPOSED INFANT\n2.1\nHIV PROPHYLAXIS\nPREVENTION OF MOTHER -TO- CHILD TRANSMISSION (PMTCT)\nIn the absence of any intervention, the risk of MTCT is between 15 and 45%.\nHowever, several effective prevention measures have been identified that\ncan reduce the transmission rate to less than 2%. These interventions\ninclude ARV prophylaxis or HAART given to HIV-1 infected pregnant\nmothers, ARV prophylaxis for their newborn babies, safer approaches to\ndelivery (including elective caesarean section) and total substitution of\nbreastfeeding with infant formula.\nThe Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG 076) protocol 4, Level 2 was the\nfirst major study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a 3-part (antenatal,\nintrapartum and neonatal) ZDV prophylactic regimen in reducing the MTCT\nby 68%. The protocol was rapidly adopted by many countries (including\nMalaysia in 1998), resulting in significant reduction in numbers of infected\ninfants. Over the years, many more trials have been conducted to evaluate\ndifferent ARV prophylactic regimens to reduce MTCT both in breastfeeding\nand non-breastfeeding populations. These trials have confirmed the efficacy\nof various regimens including ZDV alone, 5, Level 2; 6, Level 2; 7, Level 2; 8 Level 2; 9, Level 2; 10, Level\n6; 11, Level 1, ZDV + Lamivudine (3TC)12,Level 2; 13 Level 2;14, Level 2; 15, Level 6, single-dose\nnevirapine (sdNVP)16, Level 2; 17, Level 2 and more recently, combinations of ZDV +\nsdNVP 18, Level 2; 19, Level 6, ZDV + 3TC + sdNVP\n22, Level 9 and triple ART/HAART.\n20, Level 6; 21, Level 6.\nAlthough several ARV regimens have been studied using different durations\nof either single or combined drugs, questions still remain regarding which\nregimen is the best in achieving the largest reduction in MTCT. Direct\ncomparisons between studies are often difficult as studies are done using\nvarious methodologies and are conducted in different study populations.",

However, regimens that provide\nlonger infant prophylaxis appear to be beneficial if the mother has\nreceived less than 4 weeks of HAART or ARV prophylaxis before delivery.\nCombination regimens are generally more efficacious than a single-drug\nregimen.\nExposure to antiretroviral therapy or prophylaxis may induce development\nof viral resistance towards the drugs used (especially nevirapine, but\nalso lamivudine) in mothers and potentially also in their infants; this\nmay limit the choice or efficacy of antiretroviral therapies during the 6\nto 12 months following delivery.\nAdequate counselling, support and monitoring to ensure adherence to\nthe prescribed ARV regimen and chosen method of infant feeding are\nessential to PMTCT program success.\nFour commonly encountered perinatal scenarios and the recommended\napproaches to ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT are discussed below:\nAccording to the Malaysian CPG on Management of HIV Infection in\nPregnant Women (2008)23, Level 9, women with World Health Organisation\n(WHO) stage 3 or 4 disease or with CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 250\nper mm3 at diagnosis should be commenced on HAART, while those who are\nasymptomatic and with CD4 cell counts more than 250 per mm3 at diagnosis\nare given short term antiretroviral therapy (START).\nScenario 1: HIV infected pregnant mother who is already on HAART\nThe risk of MTCT in this group is low but not negligible and depends on the\ndegree of viral suppression in the mother. The duration of ZDV for the infant\nis based on the data extrapolated from PACTG 076 study.\nAs the evidence for the optimal duration of infant component of ZDV is still\ninconclusive, the current recommendations differ from country to country,\nranging from one week in some countries to four to six weeks in others.22, Level\n9; 24, Level 9;25, Level 9",

In such situations there may be concerns about\npossible adverse effects of maternal ART on the foetus. In addition, mothers\nmay have co-existing infections, in particular sexually transmissible\ninfections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB) thus exposing the foetus and\nneonate to such infections.\nA Swiss study reported a possible association between multiple ART and\npreterm labour,\n32, Level 6 although this was not observed in another study\ninvolving a larger number of HIV infected mothers.33, Level 6 The latter study\nhowever, seems to suggest a significant difference in the rate of very low\nbirth weight (VLBW) infants in those mothers who received a protease\ninhibitor (PI) compared to those who did not. The European Collaborative\nStudy\n34, Level 6, in its analysis of 3740 mother-infant pairs with 1973 infants\nexposed to ART (including 602 exposed to HAART) enrolled between 1986\nand 2003 identified 1.6% (31 of 1973) as having various congenital\nabnormalities. Congenital abnormalities were also noted in 1.4% (24 of\n1767) unexposed children. Concerns have been noted regarding an association\nbetween first trimester efavirenz exposure and neural tube defects based on\na study in monkeys and case reports in humans. 23, Level 9\nThus to date, current evidence suggests that there is no apparent increase\nin any particular abnormality with the use of ART or HAART during pregnancy.\nWith expanded use and development of new ARV drugs however, further\nmonitoring and research are necessary to assess the teratogenic and other\nrisks of use of combinations of antiretroviral and other drugs at the time of\nconception or in early pregnancy.",

In addition, both CD4% and\npVL are poorly predictive of disease progression in infants <12 months of\nage, hence the recommendations for starting ART are usually more aggressive\nin young infants.\nThis needs to be balanced against the safety and tolerability of HAART, lack\nof data on the pharmacokinetics of HAART in young infants and the difficulty\nin achieving viral suppression in view of the high viral load commonly seen\nin young infants. Faye 146, Level 6 in a small cohort of 31 infants, found only 50%\nof those on HAART had VL suppression (pVL<500) at 6 months and only\n18% at 24 months, highlighting the difficulty in sustaining VL suppression in\nyoung infants.

HAART has been shown to\nimprove the average weight gain of HIV infected children from subnormal to\nnormal after 1 year of treatment and average height growth to nearly normal\nafter 2 years of therapy.\n182, Level 2 Verweel et al\n183, Level 6 has also reported\nfavourable response to height and weight parameters especially among\nchildren responding to HAART.\nHowever, Lindsey et al,184, Level 6 report that despite viral suppression and\nimprovement in immunologic status with HAART, there appears limited\nimprovements in neurodevelopmental functioning in young children. Further\nstudies are needed to further assess mental, neurological and psychological,\nphysical, emotional and sexual maturation in children maintained on HAART.\nh) Virologic monitoring\nThe aim of therapy is to suppress the plasma viral load to as low as possible\nand for as long as possible.\nDefinitions of response to therapy however are varied. In general, several\nstudies have illustrated that most patients who respond and have durable\nsuppression would have pVL decline by 1/10 or 1 log10 from baseline after\n8 weeks of therapy and viral suppression (pVL <50c/ml) by 24-32 weeks.\nTime to suppression may be longer in those with higher baseline pVL.

In\nsuch patients, a sustained pVL decline by 1.5-2 log10 is considered\nadequate suppression.\ni) Intermittent viremia\nAmong patients achieving viral suppression to undetectable (<50c/ml by\nultrasensitive assay), there are a number who experience episodes of\nintermittent low level viremia or 'blips'. These are defined as single VL\nmeasurements of 50-200 c/mL. (sustained elevated results are considered\nvirologic failure.) These episodes have been reported in 11-40% of patients\non HAART.

It must be\nnoted however that the patient’s best response will be to his/her first-line\nHAART regimen.\nTreatment failure is defined as suboptimal response or a lack of sustained\nresponse to therapy. It can be defined as an inadequate virologic, immunologic,\nor clinical response to antiretroviral therapy. It usually begins with virological\nfailure, followed by immunological failure and eventually clinical failure.213, Level 9\nCareful assessment is required to evaluate the aetiology of treatment failure\nand determine the appropriate management strategy. A change in ART may be\nconsidered in a number of different situations, including:\n• Suboptimal virologic response to therapy or a sustained increase in viral\nload\n• Suboptimal immune response to therapy or immunologic deterioration\n• Suboptimal clinical response to therapy or clinical disease progression\n• Significant drug intolerance or toxicity\n• Significant and unmodifiable adherence issues.\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN",

Many OI in adults are secondary to reactivation of\npreviously acquired opportunistic pathogens, which were acquired when\nhost immunity was intact. However, OI among HIV infected children more\noften reflect primary infection with the pathogen. In addition, among children\nwith perinatal HIV infection, the primary infection with the opportunistic\npathogen is occurring after HIV infection is established when the child's\nimmune system might already be compromised. 218, Level 9\nIn general children with HIV infection are at increased risk of bacterial infections\nsuch as diarrhoeal disease and pneumonia. Common bacterial pathogens\ninclude Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, non-typhi Salmonellae and other\ngram-negative organisms.219, Level 5\nThe data for OI locally and globally are limited. A large multicentre prospective\ncohort study from the USA (2767 enrolled) has shown the incidence of OI\nhas decreased in the HAART era.219, Level 5 The most common OI in this study\nwas bacterial pneumonia with a Cumulative Incident Rate (CIR) of 2.15 per\n100 person-years(py). It accounted for 22.2% of all OI. The other OIs found\nwere\nHerpes\nzoster/varicella\n(CIR\n1.55/py),\ndermatophyte\ninfections (IR 0.88/py) and oral candiasis (CIR 0.93/py) Similar findings were\nseen in another prospective cohort study.225, Level 5\nIn descriptive studies from developing and less developed countries\nbacterial pneumonia and sepsis are also the most common OIs. However\nunlike data from the USA, PCP and pulmonary tuberculosis seem to be\nmore common.221,Level 8; 222, Level 8 In Thailand, disseminated infection with the\nfungus Penicillium marneffei is one of the most common opportunistic\ninfections. 223, Level 8\n4.2\nPREVENTING OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS\nIn a large RCT study (African setting) co-trimoxazole prophylaxis significantly\nreduced all-causes mortality by 43% in asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV\ninfected children (aged >1 year).128, Level 2 A Cochrane review used this single\nstudy to recommend that TMP/SMX prophylaxis be used to decrease\nmortality and morbidity among HIV infected children.224, Level 1 This benefit was\nseen across a large range of CD4 count thus concluding that the benefit\ncould be due to a reduction in PCP and non PCP.

Using in-depth interviews of 42 HIV infected children\non treatment and their care givers in a HIV clinic (Uganda) it was noted that\ncomplete disclosure by caregivers to children & strong parental relationships\nwere related to good adherence.241, Level 8 In Puerto Rico 70% HIV positive\nyouth had feelings of normalcy 6 months post-disclosure and most also\nimproved their adherence to therapy after disclosure.

Realistically in a need to know\nsituation, no more than two staff need to know if a pupil is affected or infected\nby HIV. One would normally be the head teacher and the other a designated\nstaff member, ideally chosen by the pupil and parent, who can oversee the\nchild's education, care and well-being and provide supportive counselling\nwhen necessary. The majority of infected children spend their school career\nhealthy, but they may need time off for medical appointments and may\noccasionally have periods in hospital.
