In addition to\nthe general text and photographic updates, new and updated information\nhas been included. Clinical audit indicators have also been identified for\nthe purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.\n\nEvidence was retrieved from publications from the year 2002 onwards.\nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: PUBMED/MEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic\nReviews (CDSR); ISI Web of Knowledge; and full text journal articles via\nOVID search engine. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles\nretrieved were searched to identify further studies. The search process\nwas conducted between May 2012 and May 2013 and only literature in\nEnglish was included.\n\niv",

The design should be simple for patients to use (Refer\n‘Appendix 1).\nComponents of Removable Appliances\n\nActive components.\n\nRetentive components.\nAnchorage.\nBaseplate.\n\n9.2 Active Components\nThe active components provide force to move teeth. Examples of\nactive components are springs, bows, expansion screw and elastics.\nThe commonly used active components for anterior crossbite\ncorrection are Z- spring and expansion screw.\n\n© = Z-springs\n\nA z-spring made of 0.5mm hard stainless stee! wire is sufficient to\ncorrect a simple crossbite involving one tooth. The spring has an arm\nand two activation coils. The coils are of 3.0mm in diameter. The arm\nof the spring is placed on the palatal surface of the tooth.\n\n18",

            "text": "Activation of spring is either by opening of the coils or pulling the\nouter arm of the spring forward and away from acrylic base plate.\nThe recommended force is approximately 30g. The direction of\nactivation is perpendicular to the tangent of the palatal surface of the\ntooth. This may need anterior retention as it may displace the\nappliance downward.\n\n© Expansion Screws\n‘Screws are used to prociine two or more teeth. A screw applied large\nintermittent force to the teeth. It is placed parallel to the intended\ntooth movement. One of the advantages of the screw is a clasp can\nbe placed on the teeth to be moved. It is very useful in cases where\nthere is inadequate number of teeth for retention.\n\n‘Screw is activated in the base plate by the patient at home according\nto the direction showed by the clinician. The activation is done\n‘one-quarter turn once weekly which separates the acrylic by about\n0.25mm. More frequent adjustments, up to twice a week are\npossible but care must be taken not to overdo it as this can cause the\nappliance to be ill-fitting,\n\n9.3 Retentive Components\n\n‘Adequate retention is important for compliance and efficiency of the\nappliance. If the appliance is loose, the patient may have difficulty\nwearing it. Furthermore, the active components will not work\neffectively in a loose appliance. Common retentive components\nused are the Adams and Southend clasps.\n\n19",

It can also be made on premolars\nusing 0.6mm hard stainless steel wire.\n\nThe arrowhead is angled at 30° - 45° to engage the undercuts\npresent at the junction of the mesial and distal surfaces of the buccal\naspects of the tooth.\n\nClasps should be adjusted only when necessary. The clasps can be\nadjusted in two places, i.e. bend in the middle of the flyover and\nadjustment near the arrowhead.\n\n© Southend Clasp\n\nThis clasp is preferred where incisors are to be used for retention. It\nis less obstructive and easily adaptable. The wire used for its\nconstruction is 0.7mm stainless steel. Retention is increased by\nbending the arrowhead towards the teeth.\n\n9.4 Anchorage\n\n‘Anchorage is a source of resistance to the reaction from the active\n‘components.
