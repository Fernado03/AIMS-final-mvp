The Review Committee was actively involved in the \ndevelopment process of these guidelines.\nThe previous edition of the CPG on Management of Periodontal \nAbscess (2004) was used as the basis for the development of these \nguidelines. \nThe recommendations were adapted taking into consideration local \npractices.\nSeveral improvements have been introduced in this edition. In addition \nto the general text and photographic updates, new and updated \ninformation has been included in the management such as use of \nantimicrobials, key messages and recommendations. Besides this, \nclinical audit indicators have also been identified for the purpose of \nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes.\nEvidences were retrieved from publications up to June 2016. Literature \nsearch was carried out using the following electronic databases: \nPUBMED/MEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); \nISI Web of Science; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and full text \njournal articles via OVID search engine.  In addition, the reference \nlists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further \nstudies. The following free text terms or MeSH terms were used either \nsingly or in combination to retrieve the articles: periodontal abscess, \nacute periodontal abscess, chronic periodontal abscess, multiple \nperiodontal abscess, gingival abscess, pericoronal abscess, perio-\nendo lesions, periodontal probing, aetiology, microbiology, periodontal \npathogens, oral hygiene, smoking, diabetes mellitus, tooth extractions, \nchemotherapeutic, antibiotics, treatment, debridement, photodynamic \ntherapy and supportive periodontal therapy.

The group members met a total of 11 \ntimes throughout the development of these guidelines. All retrieved \nliterature were appraised by at least two members and presented in \nthe form of evidence tables and discussed during group meetings. \nAll statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon \nby both the development group and review committee. This CPG is \nbased on reference to the findings of randomized controlled trials, \ndescriptive studies, clinical experiences, case reports and adapted \naccording to local practices. However, when there was lack of \nevidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group \nmembers. Although ideally patients’ views and preferences need to \nbe considered in the development of CPGs, in this instance, it was not \nfeasible. \nThe levels of evidence of the literature were graded using the modified \nversion from the United States (U.S) / Canadian Preventive Services \nTask Force, while the grading of recommendations was based on the \nmodified version of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network \n(SIGN).\nThe draft was reviewed by a team of internal and external reviewers. It \nwas made available on the websites of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia \nand Academy of Medicine, Malaysia for comments and feedbacks. \nRecommendations were presented to the Technical Advisory \nCommittee for CPGs, and finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry \nof Health, Malaysia for approval.\nClinical significance of periodontal abscess (PA):\n\t\ni.\t This condition is rampant but has been under-recorded in \n\t\n\t\nHealth Information & Management System (HIMS) data mainly \n\t\n\t\ndue to diagnostic confusion.\n\t\nii.\t If left untreated, PA may lead to:\n \n• Tooth loss resulting in reduced oral function and impaired \n\t\n\t\nquality of life (QoL)\n \n• Financial implications in replacing missing teeth and oral \n\t\n\t\nfunctional rehabilitation \n\t\niii.\t Interlink between oral-systemic health (periodontal medicine) in \n\t\n\t\nperiodontal conditions and systemic diseases, especially \n\t\n\t\nbidirectional relationship between diabetes mellitus and \n\t\n\t\nperiodontitis. \niii",
