There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary \nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following \nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database \nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines \nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published in English \non studies conducted in humans, from year “2012 to Current”. In \naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines \nwere searched, and experts in the field were contacted to identify \nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 19 November 2018 \nto 26 February 2019. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical \nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 30 June 2021 to be included. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nThe details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from \nthe CPG Secretariat.\nReferences were also made to other CPGs on Tuberculosis e.g.:\n•\t World Health Organization - WHO consolidated guidelines on \ntuberculosis. Module 1: Prevention - Tuberculosis preventive \ntreatment (2020)\n•\t National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – \nTuberculosis (updated September 2019)\n•\t World Health Organization (WHO) - Treatment of Tuberculosis: \nGuidelines for treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis and \npatient care (2017 Update)\n•\t American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention/Infectious Diseases Society of America - Official \nAmerican Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention/Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical \nPractice Guidelines: Treatment of Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis \n(2016)\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for \nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to their use as references.\nA total of 13 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different \nsections.

All statements and \nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the \nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations \nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG was developed \nlargely based on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and \nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles \nof GRADE (refer to page i). The writing of the CPG strictly follows the \nrequirement of AGREE II. \nUpon completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external \nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for \nfeedback from any interested parties.

The TB incidence for Malaysia in 2015 was 79.0/100,000 \npopulation. In 2020, the TB incidence was reduced to 72.4/100,000 \nbut it was still below the End TB Strategy target. There were 1,696 TB \ndeaths (TB mortality rate of 5.5/100,000 population) in 2015 and this \nincreased to 2,320 deaths (7.1/100,000 population) in 2020.3, level III By \n2035, Malaysia aims to reduce TB death to fewer than 85 deaths per \nyear. \nIn 2019, the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) was estimated \nat 87,000 with 3,564 newly notified.4, level III The incidence of HIV-TB \nco-infection in Malaysia in 2020 was 1,700 (5.2/100,000 population). \nIn terms of drug resistance, the occurrence of multi-drug resistant TB \n(MDR TB) among patients with TB infections was 0.34%.5, level III 221 \ncases of laboratory-confirmed rifampicin-resistant and MDR TB was \nreported in 2020.6, level III\nThe vision of the National Strategic Plan for TB Control (2016 - 2020) is \nfor Malaysia to be a TB-free country by year 2035 (<1 case/1,000,000 \npopulation). To achieve this, it is vital to ensure timely universal access \nto quality-assured diagnosis and treatment for all forms of TB.7, level III \nMalaysia faces many challenges in her TB control programme, from \ndelays in the diagnosis of smear negative PTB, extrapulmonary TB \n(EPTB) and TB in children to treatment default and non-adherence. \nThe newly launched programmatic management of latent TB infection \n(LTBI), also known as TB preventive treatment, will take time to mature \nand produce results. The socially disadvantaged still have difficulty \naccessing TB services due to various reasons e.g. transportation \nissues and poor social networking.\nThis CPG hopes to address some of these challenges and to provide \nupdated information on diagnostic tests available in Malaysia since the \nprevious edition in 2012. It will supersede all earlier MoH guidelines \nof drug-susceptible TB. The management of drug-resistant TB was \naddressed earlier in the CPG on Management of Drug Resistant \nTuberculosis (1st Edition) 2016.",

However, typical symptoms may \nbe absent in the immunocompromised or elderly patients.\nWhen reviewing a patient with suspected TB, taking a full history and \nconducting a complete clinical examination is a must, followed by \nperforming a chest radiograph (CXR) and sputum smear microscopy. \nIn a centre where radiography facilities are not available, diagnosis of \nPTB can be made based on clinical findings and positive sputum smear \nresults. All patients should be routinely screened for HIV and diabetes \nmellitus.\n•\t All patients with clinically diagnosed or bacteriologically confirmed \ntuberculosis must be notified under the Prevention and Control of \nInfectious Diseases Act, 1988 (Act 342) to the District Health Office. \nTB notification is mandatory within seven days of diagnosis and \nfailure to notify is compoundable.\nb.\t\nDiagnosis\n•\t\nLaboratory investigations\nAll patients suspected of having PTB should submit at least two sputum \nspecimens for microscopic examination. When possible, at least one \nearly morning specimen should be obtained as sputum collected at this \ntime has the highest yield.8 For patients who are unable to expectorate \nsputum spontaneously, sputum induction may be done. Refer to \nAppendix 3 on Procedure for Sputum Induction.\nSputum should be sent for mycobacterial culture at the initiation of TB \ntreatment to confirm the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. \ntuberculosis) and to exclude drug-resistant TB. In a patient suspected \nof drug resistant TB, rapid molecular tests should be done prior to \ntreatment for early confirmation of drug resistance.

However, smear negative results may delay PTB diagnosis. This \nmay be related to the lack of knowledge or experience of healthcare \nproviders in detecting the disease or the poor sensitivity of diagnostic \nmethods to detect cases at an early stage. In patients suspected to \nhave smear negative PTB, referral to a centre with experience in TB \nmanagement is indicated. \n•\t\nChest radiography\nIn general, CXR is helpful in detecting PTB. Its sensitivity ranged from \n87 to 98% when compared with mycobacterial culture.21  \nIn a cross-sectional study comparing two community screening tests for \nTB, CXR was more sensitive in diagnosing PTB compared with Xpert \nMTB/ RIF sputum examination, 80% versus 34% respectively.22, level III\nThus, CXR is helpful to diagnose smear negative PTB.

Data from the \nPharmacovigilance Section, Centre of Compliance and Quality Control \nNational Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA), MoH indicates \nunderreporting of these events, even for severe ADRs. Knowledge \nabout anti-TB ADR rate is important to the national TB control \nprogramme, as recommendations on treatment regimen are partly \nbased on adverse effects and treatment completion rates. Although \nreporting of these events is not mandatory, clinicians and their support \nstaff should proactively report ADRs.\nRisk factors for anti-TB ADR depend on the type of ADR. For anti-TB \ndrug-induced liver injury (DILI), risk factors include abnormal baseline \nALT, advanced liver disease, liver transplant, hepatitis C infection, \nadvanced age, female gender, slow acetylator status, malnutrition \nand HIV infection.13; 101, level III For INH-induced neuropathy, risk factors \ninclude pregnancy, extremes of age, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, \nalcoholism, malnutrition and chronic renal failure.13\nAnti-TB ADRs present in a myriad of ways, with different frequency \n(common to rare) and severity (mild to severe). Hence, a high index of \nsuspicion is required to make the diagnosis. Children are believed to \nexperience less anti-TB ADR compared with adults.\nIdentification of the offending drug may be challenging in anti-TB ADR \nbecause of the use of combination antibiotic therapy. In such instances, \nthe WHO-Uppsala Monitoring Centre causality assessment system \nmay be used.102, level III\nThe use of skin or laboratory tests for the diagnosis of anti-TB ADRs \nare still experimental. Studies using skin or laboratory tests were \nsmall, isolated and used home-grown tests. Therefore, they cannot be \nrecommended for the diagnosis of anti-TB ADRs.\nIn patients with suspected severe ADRs, full blood count, renal and \nliver function tests should be obtained. The presence of eosinophilia \nsupports the diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity syndrome. While the \npresence of cytopenia, renal or liver impairment help to narrow the \nlist of offending drugs. Additional investigations may be required as \ndictated by the clinical presentation.\nThe proper grading of ADR facilitates its management.

Potential \nDDIs are even more complicated in real life because patients may be \non more than one drug that interacts with another.\na.\t\nAnti-tuberculosis drug interactions\nAnti-tuberculous rifamycins (RIF, RFB and RPT) are key drugs in active \nand latent TB treatment. Rifamycins are enzyme inducers of a variety of \nmetabolic pathways and hence they interact with many commonly used \ndrugs. Rifamycins vary in their enzyme inducing potency with RIF being \nthe strongest, and weekly RPT the weakest.13 Clinicians managing TB \nmust be familiar with rifamycin-drug interaction, particularly with new \ndrugs. Refer to Appendix 13 on Drugs with Potential Interactions \nInvolving Rifamycin for the description and management of rifamycin \ndrug interaction.\nIn contrast with the rifamycins, INH inhibits drug metabolism. It \nincreases the toxicity of antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin), \nand certain benzodiazepines (diazepam). Combining RIF with INH \nleads to a net drug metabolizing effect due to the stronger enzyme \ninducing effect of RIF.13 Refer to Appendix 14 on Drugs with Potential \nInteractions Involving Isoniazid for the description and management \nof INH drug interaction.\nb.\t\nAntiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis drug interactions\nRifamycins affect the ARV classes differentially and may compromise \nthe effectiveness of ART. But because of the importance of rifamycins \nin TB treatment, they are only replaced if there is an absolute \ncontraindication. No clinically significant interactions are expected \nbetween ARVs with INH, EMB or PZA.\n•\t\nNucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors\nThere are no clinically significant interactions between NRTIs with \neither RIF or RFB.8 However, there is limited evidence on the safety",
