As the average age of menopause in Malaysia is around 50 years, \none-third of the lives of women are going to be without the hormone estrogen, making \nthem susceptible to a multitude of problems; ranging from social to medical issues such \nas coronary heart disease, non-communicable diseases, osteoporosis, and cancers.  \nThis Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on Management of Menopause in Malaysia, a \ncollaboration between the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Malaysia, the \nMalaysian Menopause Society along with the College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, \nAcademy of Medicine, Malaysia is an excellent start on what we can do for our aging \nwomen. Awareness of problems that menopause can bring, preventive strategies, early \ndetection, and menopause management are essential. We need to take away the \nmenopause “vacuums’ that have been created over the years and talk more openly about \nmenopausal health. \nMenopausal hormone therapy remains an effective option for menopausal symptoms. \nRobust clinical data has indicated the effectiveness and safety of these therapies in early \nmenopause. It is therefore important to reappraise the current evidence available and the \nproduction of this guideline is timely to encourage healthcare professionals to play an \nimportant role in promoting, counseling, and providing health education regarding \nmenopausal hormonal therapy. \nThank you to the members of the expert panel, the review committee, HTA at MOH, and \nthe external reviewers for producing this clear and concise guideline. It is my fervent hope \nthat this CPG will help educate our healthcare workers to be proactive in managing \nmenopausal health, as preventive and early detection strategies can be implemented as \na woman goes through menopause \n \n \nKHAIRY JAMALUDDIN \nMINISTER OF HEALTH MALAYSIA \nFOREWARD",

Throughout this CPG, \nMHT would be used and is synonymous with HRT.\nDEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this CPG comprised of \ngynaecologists (both from the Ministry of Education and the private sector) \nwho have been actively involved in the management of menopause in Malaysia, \nhaving run menopause clinics in their hospitals and published local papers \non menopause health in Malaysia. They were aided by an endocrinologist \nfrom the private sector who specialises in post-menopausal osteoporosis and \nmetabolic problems.\nThere was active involvement of allied health care professionals in the \nmultidisciplinary review committee (RC) comprising of a family physician, an \noccupational health doctor, a pharmacist, a staff nurse and a doctor from East \nMalaysia so as to make this CPG as far reaching as possible. As this CPG is a \ncombined effort with the Ministry of Health and Academy of Medicine, the \nrepresentatives of each were present. Various ideas and suggestions were \nincorporated to complete this CPG.\nThere were 10 meetings carried out in the offices of the Obstetrical and \nGynaecological Society of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. Two subsequent meetings \nwere in the meeting rooms of Pantai Hospital Kuala Lumpur. As the pandemic \nstruck, subsequent collaborations were through zoom.\nA review of current and past literature was made using electronic databases \nincluding Medscape, OVID, PubMed and the Cochrane Data base of Systemic \nReviews and Guidelines International Network (refer to Appendix 1 for \nExample of Search Strategy). Due to evolvement of hormone replacement \ntherapy since 1990, the search covered literature published from 1990 – April \n2021 on humans, specifically women and in English. In addition, the reference \nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in \nthe field contacted to identify relevant studies.  All searches were conducted \nfrom 12th August 2018 to 23rd Feb 2020. Literature search was repeated for \nall clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published before 31st May 2021 to be included. Future CPG",

The details of \nthe search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nA total of 9 main clinical questions were developed under different sections \n(refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). Members of the working committee \nwere assigned individual questions within these sections. All literature retrieved \nwere appraised by at least two members of the working committee using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables \nand further discussed in each meeting. All statements and recommendations \nformulated after that were agreed upon by the developmental group, the \nreview committee and the external reviewers.

It also marks the end of \nher fertility. The diagnosis of menopause is made only after a woman has not \nhad a period for twelve full months. As estrogen carries a protective effect on \nher organs, menopause then subjects a woman to various health problems \nand long-term morbidities.\nIn 2021, the average life expectancy of a Malaysian woman was 78.3 years. \n1 (Level II-3) As the average age of menopause in Malaysia is 50.7 years, one third \nor more of her life is now going to be spent in the post-menopause, a state of \nestrogen deficiency.2 (Level II-3)\nWhile many women tend to be worried about the vasomotor symptoms and \nskin changes that are associated with the menopausal change, the long-\nterm effects of menopause are more alarming. Estrogen protects a woman \nagainst metabolic diseases. Malaysian statistics show a high incidence of \ndiabetes, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels in the local post-\nmenopausal cohort. The increased abdominal fat layer that occurs in women \nafter menopause aggravates these medical health issues.3 (Level II-3)\nEstrogen protects the heart and with menopause, the risk of cardiovascular \ndisease increases. After the age of 55 years, the incidence of cardiovascular \ndisease in both Malaysian men and women are on par, with coronary heart \ndisease (CHD) being the leading cause of death for both sexes. Women \nunfortunately have an atypical presentation of CHD, which is usually \nprecipitated by microvascular heart disease. This is further exacerbated by \nmental and emotional stress rather than with exertion, as in the man.\nThe risk of osteoporosis is doubled in post-menopausal women as compared \nto a man. By 2050, more than 50% of the world’s hip fractures is projected to \noccur in Asia. Unfortunately, local data reveals a 20% mortality rate after a hip \nfracture with more than 40% of men and women always needing support or a \nwalking frame for the rest of their lives.4 (Level III)\nMalaysian women seldom talk of their symptoms related to the genitourinary \nsyndrome of menopause (GSM) such as bladder incontinence, vaginal \ndryness, painful intercourse and bleeding during sex (sexual health issues). \nMany women suffer in silence and take it as an accepted part of growing old, \naffecting their self-confidence and partner relationships.",

It is also advised for women to prevent or manage \nchronic conditions that may occur with menopause.\nBenefits of MHT outweigh risks when given to healthy symptomatic women \nwho are less than 60 years or within 10 years of onset of menopause.97 (Level I)\nMHT is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM. It is the only known \ntreatment that has been shown to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures.97 (Level I) \nThe Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study was a large double blinded, \nplacebo controlled, randomised study that assessed the effect of hormones \non the health of 160,000 women between the ages of 50 – 79 years. The study \nhad two arms; one arm assessed the effect of conjugated equine estrogen \n(CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in women with a uterus whilst \nthe other arm assessed the effect of CEE alone in women without a uterus. \nIn 2002 and 2004, both arms of the (WHI) study was prematurely stopped. \nThe study with women on the combined therapy of CEE and MPA was halted \nat 5.6 years due to an increased risk of breast cancer and when other overall \nrisks exceeded benefits. The study with women on the estrogen only arm was \nhalted at 7.2 years due to an increased risk of stroke.98 (Level I)\nPost WHI, further breakdown of the data has shown that the benefits and risks \nof MHT vary with the woman’s age, time since menopause, underlying health \nconditions, type of MHT used and delivery methods. The “timing hypothesis” \nshowed that the risks with MHT use was  lower in women closer to menopause \nonset than in those distant from the transition.\nIn 2017, a cumulative observational follow of the WHI study revealed that \nwomen on hormone therapy, either CEE and MPA (non-hysterectomised \nwomen) or CEE alone (hysterectomised women), showed no increased risk of \nall-cause, cardiovascular or cancer mortality when compared to the women on \nthe placebo arm when followed up for 18 years.99 (Level I)\nWomen between 50 -59 years on the CEE and MPA combination showed a \nnon-significant lowered mortality trend towards CVD, cancer and other causes",

Many ethnic groups in \nMalaysia maintain separate cultural identities. This section will briefly deal with \nIslam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. All religions welcome menopause \npositively and this section is to share the views of the various religions with \nregards to menopause. \nChristianity\nChristianity understands that the process of menopause is part of God’s \ndesign and that the postmenopausal woman should emerge stronger, more \nassured, and content. Being older allows time for freedom for service. During \nthe menopause transition period (which can be challenging), the Christian \nwoman can turn to God’s words for wisdom to help her and her family. The \nChristian woman can be assured that God will never leave her or forsake her. \nIf she is married, the Christian woman should confide in her husband and \ncommunicate about her menopausal symptoms especially if she is not able to \ncope. In God’s teachings, husbands are to love their wives and to cherish them \nalways. Menopausal women should stay healthy and focus on overall health \nand not on body shape. She should exercise, not overeat, be in regular contact \nwith her doctor and consider treatment like hormone therapy if she so needs \nit.294 (Level II-3)\nHinduism\nHinduism views the begininng and the end of menstrual cycles positively. \nWhen a girl gets her first menses, a celebration would be held by worshipping \nthe Fertility Gods, and the girl be given gifts. Unfortunately the monthly \nmenses is considered a taboo and she is not allowed to enter temples and \nto participate in any religious acts.295 (Level II-3) Many women in the reproductive \nage group take hormones to delay their periods if they need to attend temple \nceremonies. Thus, menopause is a welcome sign for Hindu women. Women can \nnow enter temples and are able to perform religious rituals. The menopause is \ncelebrated as a period of freedom, experience, and wisdom. Taking MHT is not \na contraindication as overall health is paramount.\nBuddhism\nIn Buddhism, menopause represents a new phase of life. The menopausal \nwoman undergoes an energetic, psychological and spiritual shift and is born \nas a “wise woman”. During this period, Buddhism teaches women to revisit \nearlier parts of their lives that were left unexamined, or any wounds which",

The lack of monthly menstrual \nbleeding gives them the freedom to perform religious activities (BAK).\nAishah, the wife of the Prophet, once said that when women reached 50 years \nof age, they would be out of the menstrual age and would not deliver babies \nanymore. \nIn the Al-Quran, from Surah An-Nur states, “Such elderly women  are past the \nprospect of marriage, there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) \ngarments, provided they make not wanton display of their beauty; but it is \nbest for them to be modest; and Allah is One Who sees and knows all things.”\nThis verse from the Quran refers to the older woman and menopause. They \nare free to perform their religious responsibilities for Allah knows and sees \neverything.\nOn 14th June 1998, the National Fatwa Council concluded on the following \nissues regarding MHT for menopausal women:297 (Level III)\nWhat is the Islamic perspective on menopause and HT?\n•\t\n\u0007It is permissible to use MHT derived from the urine of pregnant horses. \nCharacteristics of najis (colour, taste and smell) are removed after \nhormonal extraction.\n•\t\n\u0007The transdermal method will prevent water from passing onto skin \nand must be removed before the bath cleaning from hadas (menstrual \nbleeding or after sex).\n•\t\n\u0007Bleeding while on MHT is considered as hayd (menses) and thus all rules \nregarding menses apply.\nCan women pray (and/or perform other religious activities) when there is \nvaginal bleeding (due to MHT)?\nMHT is taken with the intention of taking care of their health so that  they \ncan perform their duties towards the husbands and families.298 (Level III) Just like \nwomen with  monthly menses before menopause, Muslim women cannot",
