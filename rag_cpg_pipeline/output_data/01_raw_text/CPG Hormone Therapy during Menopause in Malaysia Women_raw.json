            "text": "1 \nFOREWORD \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHormone Therapy (HT) remains the most effective option for \nmenopausal symptoms. There are many good clinical data to \nindicate that the use of HT started in early menopause is effective \nand safe.  \n \nDespite all this, both doctors and the public are still apprehensive \nand anxious about its continued use. Prevailing misconceptions and \nmisinterpretations about HT may be contributed by several factors, \nincluding cultural practices, social mores, misinformation through \nmedia, and differing practices of medical personnel based on \ninconsistent \nscientific \ndata. \nAccess \nto \ninformation \nthrough \nunmonitored media and internet has to some extent, contributed to \nconfusing information playing down the value of good scientific facts.   \n \nThe HT users and prescribers have opened themselves to such \ninfluences. What they really need to do is to broaden their \nknowledge of the menopause and its treatment and assess its \nappropriateness in the light of recent scientific evidence.  \n \nThe results of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study has initially \nraised anxiety on HT use for the menopause, but it is prudent to \nrefer to the many international criticisms of this study, and its \nrelevance only to certain age groups with allied clinical profiles.  \n \nIt is therefore timely to re-look at the current evidence available and \nsee how scientific data will impact on HT use in Malaysian \npostmenopausal women. The production of these Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (CPG) is largely based on review of such data and \nacceptable clinical practice. \n \nThe CPG Committee has carefully deliberated on much of the \navailable scientific data to come out with various Consensus \nStatements and the CPG. Input has also been given by invited non-\ngynaecology experts in the areas of bone, cardiovascular and breast \nhealth. To further make this document credible, local and \ninternational reviewers have been invited to critically review the \ndocument before its final print.",

When the results of the Women’s Health Initiative \n(WHI) study were published in 2002 and 2004, concerns were raised \nabout the safety of HT use and this caused anxiety and concern to \nboth medical professionals and the public. \n \nThere are, currently, many new research evidences available, \nespecially on the safe use of HT in early menopause.  \n \nThe College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists, Academy of \nMedicine of Malaysia, in line with its academic aspirations, decided \nto produce an updated Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) in the \nhope that this would benefit medical practitioners in Malaysia when \nfaced with the issue of menopause treatment in their clinical practice. \n \nThe College enlisted other relevant agencies to participate in this \nventure, namely the Obstetrical & Gynaecological Society of \nMalaysia, the Malaysian Menopause Society, the Academy of \nFamily Physicians of Malaysia, and the Ministry of Health Malaysia. \n \nThe CPG Committee was tasked with deliberation of the available \nscientific data.  Experts in the areas of bone health, cardiovascular \nhealth and breast health were invited to give their input, and \nevaluation of the final document by local & international assessors \nwas sought to lend credibility to this document.",

The top 3 most common menopausal symptoms experienced by \nMalaysian  women are sleeplessness, headache and reduced \nsex drive. \nNevertheless, the experience of menopausal symptoms can be \nquite varied in different populations. \n \nIt is also seen that the more negative the attitude to menopause \nand aging, the more likely is the woman to report presence of \nsymptoms. \n \n2. In general, Malaysian women feel that menopause does affect \ntheir life somewhat, the greatest impact coming from symptoms \nsuch as joint aches and pains, followed closely by lack of \nphysical fitness. \n \n3. The menopause experience in women is worse when associated \nwith perception of losses in life, e.g. loss of childbearing capacity, \nloss of culture, threatened loss of children. \n \nMenopause experience seems to focus on the difficult \nexperiences a woman undergoes in relation to family life and \nwork experiences. \n \n4. Data shows that Malaysian women are not well informed about \nmenopause in general, but they agree slightly that severe \nmenopausal symptoms need to be treated. \n \nOverall, postmenopausal women are poorly informed about the \nmenopause, and they also have a poor understanding of it.

Contra-indications \nContra-indications to HT should be ruled out before starting HT. \nThese include the following:  \n• \nhistory of breast cancer  \n• \nhistory of VTE or stroke \n• \nundiagnosed uterine bleeding  \n• \nsignificant cardiovascular disease \n• \nhypersensitivity to estrogen. \n \n6. Timing of Initiation \nInitiation of HT should be done in relation to proximity to menopause. \nThus, it is best to start HT between the ages of 50-59 years, or \nwithin 10 years of the menopause. \n \nAfter the age of 60 years, HT should not be initiated unless there is a \ncompelling indication. \n \nFor those with premature menopause, HT should be recommended \nand started as soon as possible. \n \n7. Dosages \nAs a principle, the lowest effective dose of estrogen consistent with \ntreatment goals should be used, with a corresponding low dose of \nprogestogen. \n \nLow-dose HT has been shown to be as effective as standard-dose \nHT for most of the indications mentioned above, and hence, should \nbe the first-line choice. \n \nLower doses of progestogen will have less negative effect on breast \ncancer risk. For women with premature menopause, higher doses of \nestrogen may be required for relief. \n \n8. Addition of progestogen \nIn a woman with an intact uterus, progestogen is added to systemic \nestrogen. \nThis provides endometrial protection from unopposed estrogen and \nprevents the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.",

Dose Regimes \nThere are multiple dosing regime options especially for endometrial \nsafety when adding progestogen to estrogen (EPT). There are also \nmultiple dosing regimes when using ET. \n \nFor ET, estrogens can be given as standard or low dose, viz: \nestrogen                        \nstandard dose  \nlow dose \nconjugated equine estrogen \n0.625mg \n \n0.3mg \n17β estradiol valerate \n \n2.0mg  \n \n0.5mg – 1.0mg \nmicronised estradiol \n \n1.0 – 2.0mg \n \n0.25 – 0.5mg \ntransdermal estradiol \n \n50-100mcg  \n \n25mcg \n______________________________________________________________________________________ \n \nFor EPT, progestogens should be added to the estrogen doses above, viz: \nprogestogen \n \n \nstandard dose  \nlow dose \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate \n2.5 – 5.0mg \n \n1.5mg \nnorethindrone acetate  \n1.0 – 2.0mg \n \n0.1 – 0.5mg \ndrosperinone \n \n \n2.0mg  \n \n0.5mg \nmicronised progesterone \n100mg  \n \n50mg \n______________________________________________________________________________________  \n \nThe dose and regime of HT need to be individualized.  \n \nThis is the key to successful use of HT to provide health benefit with \nminimal risks, thereby enhancing quality of life. \n  \nOlder postmenopausal women generally require lower doses than \nyounger women. \n \n10.

The most widely prescribed \nlocal vaginal therapy for vaginal atrophy is conjugated equine \nestrogens ( CE ) cream. \n \nStudies have shown the effectiveness of CE cream in reducing the \nsign of atrophic vaginitis as measured by effects on the vaginal \nmaturation index ( VMI ). \n \nEven the use of low dose vaginal estrogens, given daily or twice \nweekly have proven effective for the same purpose. \n \n11.
