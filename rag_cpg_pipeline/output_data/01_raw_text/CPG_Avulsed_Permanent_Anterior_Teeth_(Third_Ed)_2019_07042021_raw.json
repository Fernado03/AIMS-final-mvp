They are \nintended as a guide for the best clinical practice in the management of \navulsed permanent anterior teeth presently. However, it must be noted that \nadherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to the best clinical \noutcome in individual patient care, as every health care provider is \nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the \nclinical presentation and management options available locally.\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in December 2019 and will be reviewed in \n2024 or earlier if important new evidence becomes available. When it is due \nfor updating, the head of related specialty will be informed about it. A \nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will be done on the need \nfor a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. The systematic review \nmethodology used by the Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section \n(MaHTAS) will be employed in review of the guidelines. \nEvery care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at \nthe time of publication.

            "text": "i\nLEVELS OF EVIDENCE \nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThese clinical practice guidelines (CPG) were developed by an expert \ncommittee consisting of Paediatric Dental Specialists, Dental Public Health \nSpecialists, a Restorative Dental Specialist, Dental Officers and a Dental \nTherapist mainly from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Higher \nEducation.\nThe previous edition of the CPG on Management of Avulsed Permanent \nAnterior Teeth in Children (November 2010) was used as the basis for the \ndevelopment of these guidelines. The recommendations were formulated \ntaking into consideration the best available evidence and local practices. \nSeveral improvements have been introduced in this edition. The scope has \nbeen expanded to include management of all avulsed permanent anterior \nteeth. In addition, new and updated information have been included in these \nguidelines. Besides this, clinical audit indicators have also been identified for \nthe purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.\nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic databases: \nMedline, Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and \nEmbase while full text journal articles were retrieved from these databases. \nLEVEL\nSTUDY DESIGN\nEvidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomised \ncontrolled trial.\nEvidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without \nrandomisation.\nEvidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic \nstudies, preferably from more than one centre or research group.\nEvidence obtained from multiple time series studies, with or without \nintervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the \nresults of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s) could also \nbe regarded as this type of evidence.\nOpinions or respected authorities, based on clinical experience; \ndescriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert committees.\nl\nlII\nlI-1\nlI-2\nlI-3\nSource: Adapted from Harris RP, Helfand M, Woolf SH, Lohr KN, Mulrow CD, Teutsch SM, Atkins D. \nCurrent Methods of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: A Review of the Process.

In addition, the \nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to \nfurther identify relevant studies. Literature searches were repeated for all \nclinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any \nrelevant papers published to be included. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The search strategy can be found \nin Appendix 1. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon \nrequest from the CPG Secretariat.\nThere were eight (8) clinical questions which were assigned to members of \nthe development group. The group members met a total of 10 times throughout \nthe development of these guidelines. All retrieved literature were appraised \nby at least two members, presented in the form of evidence tables and \ndiscussed during group meetings. All statements and recommendations \nformulated were agreed upon by both the development group and reviewers. \nThis CPG is based on the findings of systematic reviews, randomised \ncontrolled trials, observational studies, with local practices taken into \nconsideration. However, when there was lack of evidence, recommendations \nwere based on consensus of group members. Although ideally patients’ \nviews and preferences need to be considered in the development of CPGs, \nin this instance, it was not feasible. \nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian \nPreventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the \nformulation of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE. \nThe writing of the CPG strictly follows the requirements of Appraisal of \nGuidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE II).\nThe draft was reviewed by a panel of internal and external reviewers. \nRecommendations were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for \nCPGs, and finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia \nfor approval.\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth",

INTRODUCTION\nTooth avulsion (Figure 1, 2 and 3) is defined as the complete dislocation of \na tooth from the alveolar bone and soft-tissue socket.1 A sufficient force is \nrequired to disrupt the tooth from its periodontal ligament, as it is embraced \nin the alveolar socket. \nThe prevalence of tooth avulsion among adults aged 18 years and above \nranged from 5% to 15%.2-6 The number of individuals suffering from tooth \navulsion increases with a decrease in age.7 Adults aged between 18 to 30 \nyears, have been shown to have the lowest number of tooth avulsion \nreported (15%), as compared to adolescents (17%) and children (68%).5 In \nyoung children, the relatively resilient alveolar bone provides only minimal \nresistance to extrusive forces.\nThe National Oral Health Survey of Schoolchildren in 2017 reported the \nprevalence of traumatised anterior teeth among children aged between 16 \nyears and below to be 7.2%8 which was lower than that reported in other \ncountries.9-12 84.5% of the traumatised anterior teeth amongst 12 years old \nremained untreated.8 A local retrospective study from 2001 to 2006 showed \navulsion of permanent teeth occurred between the age of 10 and 13 years, \nwith most cases involving permanent maxillary incisors.\nThe causative factors for traumatic dental injuries vary across age groups. \nSports-related accidents are the main cause for trauma to anterior teeth in \nadolescents, while, the most prevalent cause for the late adolescents and \nyoung adults is car accidents.4 In young children, the alleged identified \ncauses for tooth avulsion were motor-vehicle accidents (57%), falls (40%) \nand hit by object (3%). More than 80% of the cases were referred to the \nPaediatric Dental Specialist from the Accident and Emergency Department \nof the local hospital.13 Avulsion has also been reported as one of the common \noutcomes of domestic violence among women, children, adolescents and \nthe elderly of both genders.14\nTraumatic dental injuries inclusive of tooth avulsion, showed higher \nprevalence in boys to girls.8, 11, 12, 15-17 Boys tend to be more energetic and \nmore inclined towards vigorous outdoor activities than girls.13, 18 A significantly \nhigher prevalence of traumatic dental injuries occurred in children with Class \nII Division 1 malocclusion, inadequate lip coverage and an overjet of more \nthan 5 mm.12, 18-20\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth",

Pulpal Necrosis\nPulpal necrosis is the most common pulp complication.58, level III Once vessels \nare severed due to avulsion, infarction and coagulation necrosis of pulp \noccurs. The pulp often becomes contaminated by microorganisms from the \nextra-oral and intra-oral environment. Continual bacterial contamination of \nthe pulp and root surface leads to infection, which could arrest pulp \nrevascularisation and cause total pulp necrosis.36,level II-2, 37, level III\nPulpal necrosis can be detected as early as two weeks following \nreplantation, and can occur at any time during the early two-year period of \nreplantation (refer Appendix 6).56, level III\n6.2.2. Inflammatory Root Resorption\nThe development of inflammatory root resorption is directly related to the \nmechanical damage of the periodontium at the time of trauma.36, level II-2, 37, level III \nLoss of cementum results in dentinal tubule exposure to the surrounding \nperiodontal ligament and bone. In addition, untreated pulpal necrosis due to \ncontamination of bacteria within the root canal and dentinal tubules, \ncontributes to and aggravates the inflammatory root resorption process. \nFurthermore, inflammatory root resorption could cause dentine exposure \nthrough which toxins from bacteria present in the tubules and/or the infected \nroot canal can be transmitted to the periodontal ligament.37, level III\nInflammatory root resorption occurs in 23% (range of 0% to 64%) 25, level II-1 of \nreplanted avulsed permanent anterior teeth and can usually be diagnosed at \n8 months (between 5 and 12 months) post-replantation.56, level III Immature \nteeth demonstrated slightly higher prevalence to mature teeth of developing \ninflammatory root resorption, despite having the potential for pulpal \nrevascularisation (6.2%-69.2% for immature teeth and 2.8%-64.3% for \nmature teeth).25, level II-1\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth \npulpal necrosis\ninflammatory root resorption\nreplacement root resorption or ankylosis\ntooth loss",

Replacement Root Resorption or Ankylosis\nThere is insufficient high-quality evidence regarding the management of \nreplacement root resorption or ankylosed replanted avulsed permanent \nanterior tooth which poses a great challenge for clinical practice. Its \nmanagement is complex and requires short- and long-term treatment \nplanning with inter-disciplinary involvements.\nTooth ankylosis in growing children often leads to failure of eruption resulting \nin infra-occlusion. It disrupts local alveolar growth development and results in \nspace loss, tilting of adjacent teeth and poor aesthetic. The progression of \nreplacement root resorption in young children can be rapid, especially when \ndiagnosed before the age of 10. 60, level II-2 \nOn the contrary, tooth ankylosis in older patients may be considered an \nacceptable outcome. This age group has achieved skeletal maturity and the \nreplacement resorption progress is slow. Minor infra-occlusion may not \ncause major aesthetic concerns. The ankylosed tooth can survive for a \nnumber of years, before total bony replacement of root occurs. Eventually, \nthe crown may be lost spontaneously or by surgical intervention.60, level II-2 \nIn the management of ankylosed replanted avulsed permanent anterior \nteeth, clinicians should base the treatment planning on their experience and \nskill, patients’ preferences and perspectives.

Tooth Loss (Interim and Long-term Treatment Options)\nFailure to replant or failure following replantation of avulsed permanent tooth \nwill lead to premature loss of permanent maxillary anterior tooth. \nAlveolar ridge preservation (ARP) procedures following tooth loss have been \nintroduced to minimise alveolar ridge atrophy to facilitate future implant \nplacement. Various techniques or materials used for ARP can be categorised \ninto three:- 75, level II-2\n         Bone grafts/ substitutes (i.e. autologous bone and platelet-rich \n         plasma or PRP)\n         Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) (i.e. collagen membrane)\n         Biological active materials (i.e. bone morphogenic protein).\nIn a systematic review on ARP, the reduction in ridge width and height \nfollowing different ARP techniques may be less than that which occurs \nfollowing natural socket healing.
