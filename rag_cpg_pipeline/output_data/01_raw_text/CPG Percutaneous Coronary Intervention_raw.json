It is based on the best \navailable evidence at the time of development. Adherence to this \nguideline does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in \nindividual patient care. Thus, every health care provider is responsible \nfor the management of his/her unique patient, based on the clinical \npresentation and management options available locally.\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline was issued in 2009 and will be reviewed in 2013 or \nearlier if important new evidence becomes available.\nCPG Secretariat\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia\nAvailable on the following websites:\nhttp://www.malaysianheart.org\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadmed.org.my\nClinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n1",

In Malaysia, we have now published Guidelines \non treatment of various aspects of heart disease, including \nhypertension and myocardial infarction.\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now an established \nmethod of treating atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The \nadvent of modern stents, delivery systems and allied technologies \nhas allowed interventional cardiologists in the country to improve \ntheir means of delivering a PCI service. \nThe wealth of evidence on PCI, both local and international, has led \nto an expert panel of interventional cardiologists being convened \nto draw up these Guidelines. Clinical evidence, technical ‘tips and \ntricks’ and information on other aspects of cardiovascular disease \nmanagement, make these Guidelines useful for cardiologists and \nnon-cardiologists alike. \nWhile PCI is still a popular option for many Malaysian patients with \ndocumented obstructive coronary artery disease, it is not the only \noption. Aggressive pharmacotherapy and coronary artery bypass \nsurgery are two other important avenues of treatment. Hence, these \nGuidelines serve to aid clinicians to help patients make informed \nconsent about their treatment.\nI congratulate the panel and the National Heart Association of \nMalaysia on these Guidelines, which I believe will be an important \nresource for all concerned.\n \nY. Bhg Tan Sri Datuk Dr Hj Mohd Ismail Merican\nDirector General of Health Malaysia",

We believe these are particularly \nimportant steps in efforts to achieve better patient outcomes in those \npatients with serious disease. I congratulate the writing committee \non this comprehensive set of guidelines.  The National Heart \nAssociation of Malaysia has been a strong affiliate of the College. \nIt has also been involved with clinical care registries to measure \nperformance and adherence to Guidelines.  This guideline provides \nrecommendations for the use of percutaneous intervention in both \nstable and unstable coronary artery disease.  The document is \neasy to read, contains key messages and also provides specific \ntechnique suggestions for complicated procedures.\nThe American College of Cardiology looks forward to further \ncollaboration with the National Heart Association of Malaysia on \nfuture efforts to improve the care that we provide our patients with \ncardiovascular disease.\nW.

It can be treated by optimal medical therapy, \npercutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and coronary artery bypass \ngraft surgery (CABG). Recently there has been an increase in the \nnumber and complexity of PCI cases being performed in this country.     \nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this guideline are to critically evaluate the use of PCI in \nthe management of CAD based on currently available literature. It aims to:\n•\t assist health care providers in clinical decision making regarding \nthe appropriate use of coronary revascularisation procedures \n•\t improve patient outcomes following PCI  \n•\t improve the standard of care in patients undergoing PCI\nThis Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) has been drawn up by a \ncommittee appointed by the National Heart Association of Malaysia, \nMinistry of Health and the Academy of Medicine. It comprises \ncardiologists and general physicians from the government and private \nsectors as well as from the Universities.  \nProcess:\nEvidence was obtained by systematic review of current medical \nliterature on PCI for CAD using the usual search engines – PubMed, \nMedscape and Ovid. The other international guidelines (American and \nEuropean) on PCI were also studied. After much discussion, the draft \nwas then drawn up by the members of the Expert Panel and submitted \nto the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, \nMinistry of Health Malaysia and key health personnel in the major \nhospitals of the Ministry Of Health and the Private Sector for review \nand feedback. \nThe clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and \nmembers of the Expert Panel were assigned individual topics. The \ngroup members met several times throughout the development of the \nguideline. All retrieved literature were appraised by individual members \nand subsequently presented for discussion during group meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively \nby members of the Expert Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient \nthe recommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. The \ndraft was then sent to local external reviewers for comments. It was \nalso sent to members of the American College of Cardiology and the \nEuropean Society of Cardiology for feedback.",

To ensure successful implementation of this CPG \nwe suggest:\n•\t Increasing public awareness of CAD and its therapies.\n•\t Continuing medical education and training of healthcare providers \non the roles of optimal medical management, PCI and CABG in the \nmanagement of CAD.\n•\t Clinical audit by the National Cardiovascular Disease Database \n– PCI Registry on all interventional cardiac procedures being \nperformed in the country, both in public and in private hospitals.\n•\t All mortality and morbidity following PCI should be investigated and \nreviewed by a selective in-house committee.",

It accounted for about a fifth of the total burden \nof disease (admissions in government hospitals) in 2000. Coronary \nartery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease accounted for 50% \nand 32% of the cardiovascular burden respectively1. In 2006, CVD was \nthe commonest cause of deaths in government hospitals accounting \nfor 24.2% of total deaths2.\nManagement of CAD includes aggressive risk factor modification and \nlifestyle changes, medical therapy and revascularisation procedures. \nRevascularisation is by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and \ncoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\nIn Malaysia, there has been an increase in the number of diagnostic \nand interventional cardiac procedures performed over the last few \nyears. With technical improvement in devices and skills, more complex \nPCI cases are now being addressed. \nThe National Cardiovascular Disease (NCVD) - PCI Registry was \ninitiated in 2006 to obtain data and for clinical audit.\nThe objectives of this clinical practice guideline are to critically evaluate \nthe use of PCI in the management of CAD based on currently available \nliterature. It aims to:\n•\t\nassist health care providers in clinical decision making regarding \nthe appropriate use of coronary revascularisation procedures \n•\t\nimprove patient outcomes following PCI  \n•\t\nimprove the standard of care in patients undergoing PCI\nFor this purpose, this guideline is divided into 2 parts:\n•\t\nPart A: The role of PCI in the management of patients with CAD\n•\t\nPart B: Technical aspects of PCI as a revascularisation strategy \nGuidelines help in the management of patients. Not all eligible \npatients will have access to all the recommendations stated in \nthis guideline. Patient care should be individualised and clinical \njudgement plays an important role in decision making.",

Reperfusion may \nbe achieved by either primary PCI or fibrinolytic therapy. Primary \nPCI is defined as intervention in the culprit vessel without prior \nthrombolytic therapy. (see Flow Chart 1, page 23)\nWhen compared to fibrinolysis, patients with STEMI treated by \nprimary PCI have consistently been shown to have3:\n•\t lower short term mortality\n•\t fewer non fatal reinfarctions\n•\t fewer intracranial hemorrhages and strokes\nHigh risk patients have the greatest mortality benefit with \nprimary PCI. The short term benefits persisted during long term \n(6-18months) follow–up4,5.\nTiming is one of several factors that should be considered when \ndetermining the appropriate reperfusion strategy. In patients \nundergoing primary PCI, the optimal door to balloon time should \nbe within 90 minutes. However, with every 15 minute delay in \nthe time between arrival at the door and restoration of TIMI 3 \nflow, mortality increases6.\nThe mortality benefits of primary PCI is seen when the \nincremental delay to PCI (door to balloon time minus door to \nneedle time) is no more than 60 minutes of the patient’s arrival \nat the hospital7. A more recent study suggests that even if the \nincremental delay is up to 2 hours, primary PCI has mortality \nbenefits beyond fibrinolytic therapy8.\n “TIME IS MYOCARDIUM” \nMost of the trials comparing primary PCI to fibrinolytic therapy \nhave been carried out by experienced operators with skilled \nsupport staff. Thus to obtain the same benefits as seen in these \ntrials, it is important that primary PCI be performed promptly by \nexperienced operators and in centers performing a sufficient \nnumber of primary PCI procedures.",

It may be \npresent at admission or may develop during hospitalisation \n(in-hospital onset). In Europe, the rate of cardiogenic shock at \nadmission has remained the same but the rate of in-hospital \nonset has decreased. This was due to increased rates of primary \nPCI51.\nCardiogenic shock is usually due to left ventricular pump failure \nalthough occasionally it may be due to right ventricular infarction \nor mechanical complications such as acute valvular insufficiency \nand ventricular septal rupture. Mechanical complications should be \nconsidered for early surgical repair although surgical risks are high. \nEmergency PCI or urgent CABG is the treatment of choice and \nshould be considered early. Patients who are less than 75 years \nof age should be considered for PCI13,52 whatever the time delay; \nthe earlier the intervention the better the outcome. \nRecent data seem to indicate that selected patients older than 75 \nyears also do better with primary PCI if this is done early51,53,54. \n2.1.5.1.\t Technical considerations in Cardiogenic Shock  \nPatients in cardiogenic shock should be treated appropriately \nwith the early use of mechanical ventilation, inotropes and \nvasopressors. An IABP should be used early (preferably even \nbefore starting the procedure) to help maintain perfusion and to \naugment LV performance. In a number of small clinical studies,it \nhas been shown to improve survival even in patients not \nundergoing PCI 55-58. A recent meta-analysis however, showed \nmixed results59. The role of IABP in the management of patients \nin cardiogenic is currently being addressed in an ongoing trial60.  \nPatients in cardiogenic shock often have multivessel disease \nand all critical lesions besides the culprit lesion, should be \ndilated taking into consideration the amount of contrast used \nand the length of the procedure. This is in contrast to the usual \nrecommendation to only treat the culprit vessel in primary PCI \nfor STEMI without cardiogenic shock. If multivessel PCI is not \npossible, then the patient should be evaluated for urgent CABG.  \nThe use of stents and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors has been associated \nwith improved outcomes36.",

The diameter \nsizes are between 1.25 to 5.0mm and lengths of between 5 to 30mm.\nTheir main uses are:\n\t •\t to predilate a lesion to prepare for other device therapy eg stent \ndeployment\n\t •\t as a definitive therapy with successful POBA treatment being \ndefined as < 50% residual stenosis\n\t •\t to deploy balloon expandable stents\n\t •\t post stent dilatation for better stent apposition\n\t •\t to add support for wire and guiding catheter in treating complex \nlesions e.g. chronic total occlusions (CTO)\nThere are two terms that are frequently used in balloon dilatation:\n\t •\t Nominal Pressure – this is the pressure at which the balloon attains \nits stated size e.g. a 3.0 mm balloon attaining this size at 8 Atm\n\t •\t Rated burst pressure – it is the pressure beyond which there is a \nhigh probability that the balloon will burst \nThere are 2 different balloon systems:\n\t •\t Monorail (Rapid exchange) – it is easy to use\n\t •\t Over the wire (OTW) – it has the following advantages:\n\t \t -\t it gives better support especially in treating difficult lesions like \ncrossing a total occlusion \n\t \t -\t it allows wire exchange which cannot be performed with the \nrapid exchange system \n\t \t -\t contrast may be injected directly into it to visualize distal flow\n\t \t -\t medications may be given through it\nThere are 2 types of coronary balloons: \n\t •\t Semi-compliant balloon – this is the main workhorse balloon. It can \nincrease in size by up to 0.25 to 0.5 mm at higher pressures. Its \nrated burst pressure is lower, typically between 12 to 16 Atm.\n\t •\t Non-compliant balloon – this balloon minimally increases in size \nand its rated burst pressure can be as high as between 24 to 26 \nAtm. It is usually used to post dilate a stent for optimal results and \nto “crack” open hard lesions e.g. calcified or fibrotic lesions. The \nballoon profile is poor after initial dilatation and deflation. As such it \nmay not be reusable.\n5.1.1.\t Cutting Balloons\nThis device has 3 to 4 very fine blades within the folds of the balloon. \nWhen the balloon is expanded, the blades will cut into the tissue and \nproduce controlled dissections.

The latter has thinner struts thus resulting in \nlower risk of restenosis. It is more flexible and conformable whilst at the \nsame time having similar radial strength as the stainless steel stents. \nHowever it is less radio-opaque.\nCoronary stents come in different sizes ranging from 2.25 to 5.0 mm in \ndiameter and from 8 to 38 mm in length. Larger and longer stents are \nless deliverable. When dealing with a tortuous vessel, it is better to use \na shorter stent. \nAnother consideration in the choice of a stent will be its side branch \naccess. Good side branch access allows easier passage of devices \nthrough the stent struts.\nMost stents can be delivered through a 5F guiding catheter (except for \nthe larger stents which are >3.5 mm in diameter). Generally, for the \nsimultaneous deployment of 2 stents, the minimum size of the guiding \ncatheter should be 7F.\n5.2.2.\t Drug Eluting Stents (DES)\nThe Achilles heel of angioplasty and stenting has been restenosis as a \nresult of neointimal proliferation. If substantial, it can lead to significant \nin-stent restenosis (ISR). The rates of restenosis with BMS can be as \nhigh as 50% in certain situations e.g. CTO, long lesions, small vessels, \ndiabetics, ostial and bifurcation lesions. In large vessels (>3.5 mm) with \ndiscrete lesions the restenosis rates with BMS is low.\nStents may be coated with antiproliferative agents to inhibit neointimal \nproliferation and therefore reduce the risk of restenosis. They act on \nspecific sites in the cell growth cycle. The current agents used are the \nlimus group e.g. sirolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus and biolimus and the \ntaxol group i.e. paclitaxel.\nThe clinical studies were mainly conducted in uncomplicated (i.e. type \nA and B lesions). In the real world setting however, it is mainly used in \ncomplex lesions with a higher tendency for restenosis.\nThere are several concerns with DES:\n\t •\t Cost consideration – DES generally cost more than BMS. \n\t •\t Stent Thrombosis – section 6.8.1 (page. 55) \nIn making a choice between a BMS and DES, it is important to take into \nconsideration the patient’s risk for stent thrombosis, ISR and bleeding. If \nthe patient is unlikely to comply with long term dual antiplatelet therapy, \nis at increased risk of bleeding or may need a non-cardiac operation in \nthe near future, one should consider alternative strategies such as using \nBMS, endothelial progenitor cell capture stents or refer for CABG. \n5.2.3.\t Endothelial Progenitor Cell Capture Stents\nThis stent is coated with antibody that captures circulating endothelial \nprogenitor cells.

These include:\n\t •\t simple strategy – one that involves a single-stent. \n\t •\t complex strategies – involve double (or multiple) stents for bi-/tri-\nfurcation lesions\n\t •\t dedicated bifurcation stent – still in development\nDifferent techniques which are often utilized are:\n\t •\t V stenting \n\t •\t T stenting\n\t •\t Culotte\n\t •\t simultaneous kissing stents\n\t •\t minicrush, reversed crush\nMost bifurcations can be treated with a single-stent strategy in the main\nvessel with a provisional plan for a second stent implantation in the\nside-branch in the event of suboptimal results223,225,226. The definition of\nsuboptimal result varied among the different trials. It will depend upon \nthe size of the side-branch223.\nThe 2-stent strategy tends to be more time-consuming, uses more \ncontrast and is related to more biomarker release. It may look better \nangiographically immediately after the procedure, but, in the long \nterm is associated with greater restenosis, TVR rates and stent \nthrombosis226,227,228. \nIf the 2-stent strategy is utilised, DESs are preferred223. In post stent \ndeployment it is crucial to have kissing balloon inflation especially in \nthe crush and Cullote techniques229,230. There are some studies that \nsuggest that simultaneous kissing balloon inflation after each stent \ndeployment may further improve long term result (Double Kissing-Crush \ntechnique)231. \nAn IVUS is generally recommended when a large area of myocardium \nis at risk e.g. LMS bifurcation disease.",

Ostial Lesions\nOstial lesions are usually defined as lesions within 3mm of the take-\noff of a major coronary artery. Native aorto-ostial, aorto-graft-ostial and \nbranch-ostial lesions can be distinguished.\nTreating ostial lesions is technically difficult and is associated with a \nhigher risk of complication and re-stensosis rates. \n6.5.1.\t Technical considerations\n•\t Precise placement of the stent is important to ensure that the ostium \nis well covered and to avoid excessive jutting of the stent struts into\nthe main vessel. \n•\t Ideally the ostium needs to be ‘well prepared’ prior to stent \ndeployment.\n•\t The vessel needs to be dilated appropriately (balloon sized to the \nvessel size) before stent deployment to allow for good stent expansion. \nThis will reduce the risk of re-stenosis.\n•\t Directional atherectomy may be useful to debulk the lesion first.\n•\t DES is preferred.\nProblems that may occur include: \n•\t fall in BP when engaging the vessels – a smaller size guiding catheter \nor the use of side holes may help alleviate this. \n•\t risk of dissection – the dissection may spiral down the vessel and \noccasionally it can occur retrogradely into the aortic root. This \ncomplication may be due to guiding catheter manipulation.\n6.6. Saphenous Vein Grafts (SVG) \nFollowing CABG:\n•\t between one and six years, the annual graft attrition rate is 1% to 2% \nand becomes 4% to 6% per year after that, so that about half of SVGs \nhave significant stenosis or are occluded after 10 years. \n•\t up to 15% of SVGs are closed within 1 year232,233,234 and by 10 years, \nnearly a third of patients require repeat revascularisation235. \nThis could be due to new disease in vessels not previously bypassed, \nprogressive disease in native vessels beyond the graft anastomosis, or \ndisease in the bypass grafts themselves.\nTreatment options for Saphenous Vein Graft Disease include:\n1.\tRedo-CABG\n\t •\t Redo-CABG is associated with 2- to 4-fold higher risk than the\ninitial CABG, with periprocedural deaths in 2-5% and myocardial \ninfarctions in 2-8% of patients. Five- and 10-year survival rates are \n84-94% and 75%, respectively236,237.",

Most thrombotic stent \nocclusions can be treated with balloon angioplasty alone, aided \nby thrombus aspiration. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists may be \nadministered to improve microvascular reperfusion and to overcome \nincreased platelet aggregation253.   \nSystemic fibrinolysis should be considered in the presence of ongoing \nsignificant ischemia and unavailability of prompt PCI. If platelet \naggregation studies reveal insufficient (<50%) inhibition of platelet \naggregation with standard dual antiplatelet therapy, a higher dose \nclopidogrel - 150 mg/day- should be considered119.\nAdditional stent implantation should be limited to bail out significant \nresidual dissections. The implantation of a second stent for stent \nthrombosis is associated with a worse 6 month outcome254.  \nPCI for stent thrombosis due to either BMS or DES have similar\npoor outcomes with low rates of reperfusion and high rates of death \nand adverse cardiac events254. This further highlights the importance \nof preventing stent thrombosis and choosing the appropriate \nrevascularisation strategy for the individual patient.\nIn preventing stent thrombosis, it is important to consider253:\n•\t Patient factors: Patient compliance and absence of contraindication to \ndual antiplatelet therapy is pivotal during the decision making process \nfor stent selection254. \n•\t Technique: The stent must be well deployed and fully \nexpanded throughout its entire length.
