Every healthcare provider is \nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the \nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options \navailable locally. \nThese guidelines were issued in 2016 and will be reviewed in 2020 or \nsooner if new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, \nthe Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty \nwill be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for \na revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary \nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used \nby MaHTAS will be employed.\nEvery care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every \ndetail at the time of publication.

The inclusion criteria are all adolescents and adults (age \nmore than 12 years) with rhinosinusitis regardless of study design. \nThe search was limited to literature published in the last ten years \nand on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of all \nretrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in the \nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted \nfrom 12 May 2014 to 12 June 2014. Literature search was repeated \nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process \nallowing any relevant papers published before 28 February 2015 to be \nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after \nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis \nand Nasal Polyps developed by International Rhinology Society in 2012. \nThe CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research \nand Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to it being used as reference.\nA total of 24 clinical questions were developed under different \nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 25 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented \nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All \nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed \nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the \nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any \ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based \nlargely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical \ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nThe literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001) \nii",

However, it often coexists with \nrhinitis in most patients. Hence the current accepted terminology is \nrhinosinusitis. \nRhinosinusitis (RS) can be divided into two subtypes: acute and chronic \nbased on the duration of the symptoms. The clinical presentation \nincludes nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, headache, decreased sense of \nsmell, postnasal drip, facial pressure or pain, fever, sore throat and \ncough. Predisposing factors for RS are multifactorial, which includes \ninfection, allergies, and air pollution.\nRS poses a major health problem.

Hence, it is very important to \nfollow the instructions from your healthcare providers and refer to the \nproduct labels.\nNasal sprays are only intended for use in the nose. Do not spray it into \nany other parts of the body.\n  \nUsage of Nasal Spray for the First Time (Priming)\n1.\t Remove the dust cap (Picture A).\n2.\t Shake the nasal spray bottle.\n3.\t Picture B shows how to hold nasal spray correctly. Press down a \nfew times until you see a fine mist of spray comes out (You might \nneed to press 3 - 5 times depending on the nasal spray). This \nprocess is called Priming.\n4.\t Priming is only done once for every nasal spray. However, if the \nnasal spray has not been used for more than 1 - 2 weeks, the \npriming step has to be repeated.\n \nDust Cap\nApplicator\nApplicator Tip",

Bend your head slightly forward. \nCarefully insert the applicator tip ¼ or ½ inch into the other nostril \n(point the applicator tip slightly outwards, away from the centre of \nthe nose) (Picture D).\n4.\t Press down the nasal spray once and at the same time breathe in \nslowly through your nostril. (Picture E)\n5.\t Repeat step 4 in the other nostril.\n6.\t Do not tilt your head backwards to prevent backflow into your \nthroat.\n7.\t If the medicine drips into your throat, you will feel a slightly bitter \nsensation in your mouth. This is normal.\n8.\t Once you are done using the nasal spray, wipe the applicator tip \nwith a clean tissue or cloth and put on the dust cap.\n9.\t Try not to sneeze or blow your nose immediately after using the \nnasal spray.\n \nTips While Using the Nasal Spray\n1.\t Do not breathe in strongly and quickly to prevent the medication \nfrom going into your throat.\n2.\t If the nasal spray is used correctly, the medicine will not drip from \nyour nose nor will it drip into your oral cavity.\n3.\t Please use the nasal spray as directed by your healthcare \nproviders.\n4.\t If you experience any nosebleed following the used of nasal sprays, \nstop using the nasal spray and seek medical attention.\nKeep the nasal spray away from direct sunlight and children.\nSource: Adapted from Malaysian Official Portal MyHealth, available at: http://www.\nmyhealth.gov.my/en/how-to-use-nasal-spray/",
