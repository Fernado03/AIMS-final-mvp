This is \na combination of both Unstable Angina (UA) and Non-ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (NSTEMI). It is based on the best evidence currently available. Adherence \nto this Guidelines does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual \npatient care. Thus, every health care provider is responsible for the management of \nhis/her unique patient, based on the clinical presentation and management options \navailable locally.\nThis Guidelines was issued in 2021 and will be reviewed in 2026 or earlier if \nimportant new evidence becomes available.\n  CPG SECRETARIAT\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia\nAvailable on the following websites:\nhttp://www.malaysianheart.org\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadmed.org.my\nThis is an update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines on UA/NSTEMI (published 2002 \nand 2011) It supersedes the previous CPGs on UA/NSTEMI (2002, 2011).",

NSTE-ACS including the non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina \nis the dominant clinical manifestation of ACS in Malaysia hence ensuring the standardised \nand current clinical management for our clinicians is paramount for the safety of our patients.\nA multi-pronged approach has seen improvement in the management of ACS over the last \ndecade, in line with the development of both treatments and healthcare service delivery. \nHowever, since the publication of the previous Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the \nmanagement of NSTE-ACS in 2011, new diagnostic and therapeutic measures have been \nintroduced and practised. Therefore, the publication of the refreshed version of the 2021 \nThird Edition Clinical Practice Guideline on the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction is timely.\nAmongst the areas of focus in this brand-new CPG would be the in pre-hospital care, the \nuse of cardiac troponins in the diagnostic work-up, a greater emphasis on risk stratification \nscores early in the inpatient management, and also the recommendation of an early \ninvasive strategy for patients at the highest risk of adverse outcomes. \nI am delighted with the research contribution by the various clinical and academic groups \nfor the reference in this CPG, and I encourage such endeavours to continue for the \nimprovement in both care and outcomes in patients. This CPG complements others that \nfocus on the risk factors associated with the condition, including its sister condition,            \nST-elevation ACS in the CPG STEMI, 2019. \nI thank the members of the Expert Panel and the External Reviewers, drawn from both the \npublic and private sector of the Malaysian healthcare ecosystem, for their tireless work to \nproduce this CPG. I would also like to acknowledge the National Heart Association of \nMalaysia and my colleagues at the Ministry of Health Malaysia for publishing this important \nupdate on the management of NSTE-ACS, 2021.\nTan Sri Dato' Seri Dr. Noor Hisham Bin Abdullah\nDirector-General of Health Malaysia\nMESSAGE FROM THE\nDIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH",

Data from our \nNational Cardiovascular Disease Database - Acute Coronary Syndrome \n(NCVD-ACS) Registry showed that the in-hospital, one month and 1-year mortality \nfollowing NSTE-ACS is higher than that of other international registries. Thus, an \nupdate to our 2011 Clinical Practice Guidelines is timely.\nThis CPG consists of statements that include recommendations intended to optimize \npatient care guided by a systematic review of evidence and assessment of the \nbenefits and harms of alternative care options, reflecting the latest literature, expert \nconsensus, and wherever possible, public stakeholder comment.\nThis Guidelines has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the \nNational Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The \ncommittee members were multidisciplinary and comprised cardiologists, internal, \nemergency and family medicine specialists and cardiac rehabilitation physicians \nfrom the government, private sector and universities. The external reviewers were \nalso multidisciplinary and in addition to specialists, general practitioners were also \nincluded. Stakeholders - members of the general public - were also included as \nexternal reviewers. \nThe committee made use of the following resources in developing this CPG :- \n \n American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association  \n  (2010) Methodology manual and policies from the ACCF/AHA Task Force on  \n  Practice Guidelines \n   European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Governing Policies and Procedures for  \n  the Writing of ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines and\n   the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation [ AGREE II ] Tool\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this Guidelines are to provide guidance on:\n \n Systematic evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain to the Emergency  \n  Department to reduce the number of “missed Myocardial Infarctions”.\n  Evidence-based therapeutic strategies in patients with NSTE-ACS to reduce  \n  the risk of recurrent Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE). \n  Strategies to optimize patient care and reduce potential harm among the  \n  different subsets of patients with NSTE-ACS within the existing local frame-work \n  of healthcare.",

The search was conducted for the \nperiod 2011 till 31st August 2019. The following MeSH terms or free text terms were \nused either singly or in combination:\n“Acute Coronary Syndrome”,”ACS”, “Myocardial infarction (MI)”; “NSTEMI”; Non ST \nElevation Myocardial Infarction;” “UA”,” Unstable Angina”,”Non ST Elevation Acute \nCoronary syndrome”, “NSTE-ACS”  “definition of MI”; “Myocardial injury”, “ECG \ncriteria of NSTE-ACS”,”Rule out Protocols for ACS”; “Risk Scores for ACS”, “cardiac \ntroponins”, “Pre-hospital Management of ACS”; “Oxygen therapy in ACS”; “Risk \nstratification scores in NSTE-ACS”; “Cardiac rehabilitation”, “secondary prevention \npost NSTE-ACS”, “management of NSTE-ACS  in women, the elderly, persons with \nchronic renal disease.”\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and \npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from \nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were \nsearched to identify further studies. Regional CPGs were also studied. Experts in the \nfield were also contacted to obtain further information. International Guidelines \nmainly that from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart \nAssociation (ACCF/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used \nas references. \nThe literature retrieved was appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all \nstatements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The \nsystemic reviews were conducted “in-house” and the committee appraised the \nquality of evidence collectively. The evidence was not systematically assessed for \nconsistency, precision and directness. However, each of these attributes were \nimplicitly judged when the committee appraised and graded the evidence and wrote \nthe level of recommendation. The recommendations of the other international bodies \n– ACCF/ACC, ESC and The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \n(NICE) Guidelines-were also studied to determine their applicability to the local \npopulation and heathcare.\nThe grading of the evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG as \noutlined in page 16, were adopted from that used by the American College of",

Cardiac troponins should replace the measurement of “cardiac enzymes”-  \n  lactate dehydrogenase, transaminases and creatine kinase.\n  Most of the medications that are recommended in this Guidelines are already  \n  present in the Malaysian standard drug formulary.\n  Very high risk/high risk patients should be identified early and transferred to  \n  hospitals with existing catheterization facilities. In accordance with the national  \n  health plan, the ministry has already proposed the setting up of catheterization  \n  laboratories in most of the state hospitals.\nThis Guidelines aims to streamline management of cardiac patients and educate \nhealthcare professional on strategies to optimize existing resources. We do not \nanticipate barriers to its implementation.",

Our  \n figures are higher than those in other international registries. (Table 4, page 39) \nDefinition: \n Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a clinical spectrum of IHD that develops  \n because of an acute imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply.\n Depending upon the acuteness of onset and the degree of coronary occlusion, it  \n can range from (Flowchart 3, page 37) :\n  Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS). This is a combination of: \n  • Unstable angina (UA) and\n  • Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\n  ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n In UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac biomarkers (troponins-cTn) are  \n normal. \n Myocardial injury results in cell necrosis and cardiac biomarkers are raised. It  \n may be due to severe ischemia and/or non ischemic causes (eg myocarditis).\n Myocardial Infarction (MI) is myocardial injury due to ischemia. \n According to the 4th Universal definition, MI is diagnosed when there is a significant  \n rise and/or fall in cTn, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper  \n reference limit (URL), and accompanied with at least one of the following:\n  Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin of > 30 minutes.\n  ECG changes of ischemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q  \n  waves.\n  Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion  \n  abnormality.\n  Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy.\n There are no clear guidelines as to “significant rise and fall” of cTn levels. An expert  \n consensus committee has suggested that changes in cTn concentrations of >20%  \n should be used to define patients with an MI.\n MI may be STEMI or NSTE-ACS based on the ECG.\nPathogenesis:\n MI can be classified as 5 types depending on the pathology, clinical features,  \n prognosis and treatment strategies. (Table 6, page 41) This CPG focuses on  \n NSTE-ACS which is usually either:\n  Type 1 MI (spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, with  \n  ulceration, fissuring, erosion or dissection) or",

It may occur in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis without  \n  plaque rupture or in the absence of atherosclerosis). This is an important cause  \n  of ACS in the elderly.\n The majority (66%-78%) of ACS arise from lesions with <50% stenosis and less  \n than 5% arise from lesions exhibiting >70% stenosis.\nDiagnosis:\n The combinations of history, physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) \n are important but may be insufficient to reliably rule in or rule out NSTE-ACS. \n Cardiac troponins (cTn) T and I are the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for  \n myocardial injury and necrosis.\n Troponins are raised due to myocardial injury and this may be acute (associated  \n with a rise and fall) or chronic. There are other causes of a raised cTn besides MI.  \n (Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94). \n For a diagnosis of MI, the rise and fall of cTn should be accompanied by either a  \n clinical history consistent with MI or with ECG or echocardiographic changes  \n consistent with an MI or an intracoronary thrombus. (Section 2, pages 44 - 47) \n The cTn assays could be point of care (POC) kits or laboratory based. In general,  \n POC kits have lower analytical sensitivity and too wide coefficient of variation (CoV) \n to detect troponins at the 99th URL.  Almost all locally available laboratory-based  \n assays can measure cTn at the 99th URL. \nTriage/Risk Scores:\n Patients presenting with chest pain or chest pain equivalents may, based on the  \n initial clinical history and ECG, have:\n  Very low likelihood of NSTE-ACS or have an alternative cause for their symptoms. \n  These can be treated accordingly and be discharged from the Emergency  \n  Department (ED).\n  Definite NSTE-ACS or STEMI. These patients should be admitted and managed \n  appropriately.\n  Possible or suspected NSTE-ACS. These patients have a normal or non- diagnostic \n  ECG and need to be evaluated using a “rule out protocol” for ACS. \n Evaluation is a continuous process and it is possible for a patient to move from  \n very low likelihood ACS to definite NSTE-ACS as the disease evolves.\n Patients with possible or suspected NSTE-ACS should be:\n  Risk stratified using HEART (or modified HEART score) or TIMI risk scores\n  (Flowchart 1, page 35)",

(Section 8.1, pages 80 - 82)\n  The older patient has greater in-hospital and long-term benefits with an early  \n  invasive strategy. However, there is an increased risk of major bleeding.\n Women \n  In general, women develop Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) about a decade later than  \n  men. Premenopausal women should be managed with the same pharmacological  \n  therapy as that for men for acute care and for secondary prevention.\n  Women who are low risk and cTn negative, should be treated medically. \n  Women who are cTn positive, should be considered for an invasive strategy.\n Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  In general, patients with CKD should be managed in a similar manner as those  \n  with normal renal function. \n  They, however, have a higher bleeding tendency and doses of medications  \n  need to be adjusted according to the renal function.\n  An invasive strategy is superior to a conservative strategy.The benefit, however,  \n  declines with lower renal function, and is less certain in those with renal failure  \n  or on dialysis.\nCardiac Rehabilitation:\n Cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce mortality by approximately  \n 20% - 25% and a trend towards reduction in non-fatal recurrent MI.",

It may occur in the presence of coronary  \n  atherosclerosis without plaque rupture or in the absence of atherosclerosis).  \n  This is an important cause of ACS in the older patient.\n The majority (66%-78%) of ACS arise from lesions with <50% stenosis and  \n less than 5% arise from lesions exhibiting >70% stenosis.\nKey Messages 6#:\n Patients presenting with chest pain or chest pain equivalents, may, based on  \n the clinical history and ECG, have:\n  Very low likelihood of NSTE-ACS or have an alternative cause for their  \n  symptoms.

Our figures are higher  \n than those in other international registries. (Table 4, page 39) \nACS is a clinical spectrum of IHD that develops because of an imbalance between \nmyocardial oxygen demand and supply. It is usually due to a reduction in supply. \nDepending upon the acuteness of onset and the degree of coronary occlusion, it can \nrange from: (Flowchart 3, page 37)\n  Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS). This is a combination of: \n   Unstable angina (UA) and\n   Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\n  ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\nThe pathology is dynamic. A patient presenting with UA may progress to NSTEMI or \neven STEMI.\n2.1 Unstable Angina\nPatients with UA are a heterogenous group. According to Braunwald’s classification, \nupdated in 2000, UA may be classified as (Appendix I, page 93)9 :\n I. \nNew onset of severe angina or accelerated angina; no rest pain \n II.

Myocardial injury may be due to:10 \n  Ischemia - MI and/or \n  Non-ischaemic causes (eg. myocarditis, renal failure) \nMI is myocardial injury due to ischemia and is defined pathologically as myocardial \ncell death due to prolonged ischemia.10\n2.2.1.1 Cardiac Biomarkers in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Injury and              \nMyocardial Infarction\nThe cardiac biomarkers of choice for the diagnosis are the cardiac troponins - cTn \n(both I and T), preferably high-sensitivity (hs-cTn). Elevation of cTn indicates \nmyocardial necrosis. A level above the 99th percentile Upper Reference Limit (URL) \nis abnormal and indicative of myocardial injury.10 \nAll locally available commercial laboratory-based assays indicate this level, the exact \nvalue varying depending on the reagents and assays used. The point of care (POC) \nkits, however, although giving a more rapid result, are not sensitive enough to detect \nthis low level.  \nWith the current definition, UA patients in Braunwald’s Classification Stage III b, will be \nre-classified as NSTEMI. In one study, this re-classification increased the diagnosis \nof MI by 47%.11 This re-classification is of prognostic importance because these \npatients will now be treated more aggressively with GDT.12 \ncTn should always be interpreted in the clinical setting. Many cTn elevations, \nespecially below certain cut-off points and cTn elevations without a rise and fall, are \nmyocardial injuries and not MI (Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94).\nA rise and/or fall in the cTn level is indicative of acute injury, while a persistently \nelevated level is indicative of chronic injury10 (Table 2, page 38). Persistently elevated \ncTn levels such as that present in those with pre-existing CAD, impaired renal \nfunction, and persons older than 75 years appear predictive of a higher long-term \nmortality.13\nAccording to the 4th Universal definition, MI is diagnosed when there is a significant \nrise and/or fall in cTn, with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL, and \naccompanied with at least one of the following:10\n  Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischemic origin of > 30 minutes.\n  ECG changes of ischemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q  \n  waves.\n  Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion  \n  abnormality.",

The criteria \nfor determining a pathological rise between two serial cTn values are assay-dependent.10 \nThe National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry Guidelines and an expert consensus \ncommittee have suggested that in patients with possible ACS and baseline (initial \nresult) cTn (or hs-cTn) results:10,14-16\n  Markedly above > 99th percentile URL, changes in concentrations of >20% from  \n  baseline should be used to define an MI. \n  < 99th percentile URL and especially with hs-cTn assays, a change of 50-60% from  \n  baseline has been suggested to overcome biological and analytical variations.\nThe assays used should have a coefficient of variation (CoV) of < 10% at the 99th \npercentile URL.10,14-16 (Section 4.4, pages 51-54).\n2.2.1.2 ECG in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Injury and Myocardial Infarction\nIn myocardial injury, the ECG is either normal or showing non-specific changes and \nwithout the typical features of ischemia/infarction.\nMI may be STEMI or NSTE-ACS based on the ECG. (Flowchart 3, page 37) \nSTEMI is diagnosed when there is:\n  ST elevation of ≥ 1 mm in 2 contiguous leads including right precordial leads# or\n  A new onset LBBB in the resting ECG \n  In a patient with ischemic type chest pains of > 30 minutes and \n  Accompanied by a rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers. \n# In leads V2-V3 the cut-off point is ≥ 0.25 mV in males < 40 years, ≥ 0.2 mV in males ≥ 40 years and ≥ 0.15 mV \nin females and in posterior chest leads V7-9 ≥ 0.05 mV and ≥ 0.1 mV in men < 40 years.10 \nIn NSTE-ACS, ST elevation is absent on the resting ECG. \nUA and NSTEMI differ from each other:\n  In NSTEMI, the ischemia is severe enough to cause sufficient myocardial injury  \n  to release detectable cardiac biomarkers.  The diagnosis of NSTEMI is established  \n  if a cardiac biomarker is detected. Often, there is a lapse of time from myocardial  \n  injury before these biomarkers can be detected. As such, in the early stages, UA \n  and NSTEMI often cannot be differentiated.\n  In NSTEMI, ST/T changes may be present in the ECG, whereas in UA they are  \n  usually absent and even if they are present, are usually transient.",

Only 40% of those aged >85 years had chest pain on \npresentation compared with 77% of those aged <65 years.283 Older patients \nwere more likely to present with278: \n  Dyspnea (49%)\n  Diaphoresis (26%)\n  Nausea and vomiting (24%)\n  Neurological symptoms such as acute confusional states and syncope (19%)\nAcute pulmonary edema is a common presentation of NSTE-ACS in the older \nperson. \nType 2 MI is also common in this age group, NSTE-ACS occurring in the setting \nof another acute illness e.g. tachycardia, pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding episodes. \nECGs are often non diagnostic and serial ECGs are recommended to detect \nevolving changes. 278\nCardiac troponins are commonly elevated > 99th percentile URL in older \npatients presenting without ACS or other acute illnesses known to cause to \ntroponin elevation.284,285 In one study almost 40% of patients aged > 70years \nhad elevated troponins.285 The conventional cut-off value (99th percentile: \n0.014 ng/mL) provided low specificity, particularly in older adults.286",

Management\nComparatively fewer studies have been conducted in older adults - specifically \nolder persons are under-represented in many studies on CAD. Therefore, the \nstrength of recommendations for this age group is somewhat lower than that \nsupporting recommendations in younger adults, highlighting the dire need to \nconduct more research studies in this patient population. \nThere is limited trial data to guide management in the older person especially \nin the setting of advanced age (more than 75 years) or significant comorbidity \n(e.g. prior stroke, renal impairment). One should consider the biological age \nrather than the chronological age of the patient when making management \ndecisions. This is almost always based on physician judgement rather than \non biological age predictors. There are several existing predictors which are \nstill in the research stage - the most plausible candidates being the epigenetic \nclock and telomere length.291 \nOlder patients are a heterogenous group and the risk benefit ratio of each \nintervention should be individualised. As renal impairment is very common in \nolder adults, creatinine clearance should be calculated to enable appropriate \ndrug dosing (Appendix XIV, page 105).\nPharmacotherapy should also take into account the older person’s pill \nburden, potential drug-drug interactions and the older person’s life expectancy. \nCooperation with experienced pharmacists is therefore desirable to optimise \npharmacotherapy. \n8.1.2.1   Pharmacotherapy\n  Antiplatelet Agents\n \n \n Both aspirin and clopidogrel (especially in those undergoing PCI)  \n   confer greater benefits in older adults.279,292\n   Clopidogrel is the P2Y12 inhibitor of choice in older persons > 75 years.293\n   Prasugrel may be used in patients older than 75 years at the reduced  \n   dose of 5mg.294,295\nI,A\nI,B\nIIa,B",

In \ngeneral, the management of patients with CKD is similar to those with normal \nrenal function except for the following differences:\n  Patients with CKD have more co-morbidity and are usually older.314\n  They are at increased bleeding risks. The doses of antithrombotic agents  \n  need to be adjusted accordingly to avoid excessive bleeding (Appendix VII,  \n  page 99).323 \n \n Medications:\n   Antiplatelet agents - \n \n \n \n• Although DAPT has become the standard of care in patients with  \n    ACS and normal renal function, the benefits in persons with CKD  \n    are uncertain and are potentially outweighed by bleeding hazards.323,324 \n    In these patients, treatment should be individualised.\n   Anticoagulants - \n \n \n \n• Heparin (both UFH and LMWH) are widely used in ACS. The bleeding \n    risk of these agents however increases with the increasing severity  \n    of baseline renal insufficiency.323 Dose adjustments are important.  \n    (Appendix IX, page 101)\n   Fondaparinux is contraindicated in severe renal failure (CrCl <20 mL/min)293 \n   There are limited clinical data available on the use of Fondaparinux for  \n   the treatment of UA/NSTEMI and STEMI in patients with creatinine  \n   clearance between 20 to 30 ml/min.325 Therefore, the physician should  \n   determine if the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk. \n   Others - Similar absolute reduction in short-term mortality were  \n   observed with the use of:\n   Aspirin - 21% absolute reduction in mortality in dialysis patients, and a  \n   23% reduction in non-dialysis patients.326\n   β-blocker therapy was associated with a 14% absolute reduction in  \n   mortality in both the dialysis and non-dialysis patients.326\n   ACE-inhibitor use was associated with a 16% absolute reduction in  \n   30-day mortality in dialysis patients and a 5% reduction in non-dialysis  \n   patients.326\n   Statins in combination with ezetimibe, however, was found only to be  \n   beneficial in mild to moderate CKD. In patients on dialysis, there is a  \n   lack of evidence concerning the cardio vascular benefits of statins.327\n  Revascularization:\n   An invasive strategy is superior and associated with a decrease in  \n   mortality when compared to an initial conservative strategy (invasive  \n   management only after failed medical therapy or for objective evidence \n   of ischemia).314\nI,B",

However, there is an increased risk of major bleeding.\n Women should be managed with the same pharmacological therapy as that  \n for men for acute care and for secondary prevention.\n Women who are low risk and cTn negative, should be treated medically while  \n those who are cTn positive, should be considered for an invasive strategy.\n In general, patients with CKD should managed in a similar manner as those  \n with normal renal function. They however have a higher bleeding tendency  \n and doses of medications need to be adjusted according to the renal function.\n In patients with CKD, an early invasive strategy is superior to a delayed  \n invasive strategy. The benefit, however, declines with lower renal  \n function, and is less certain in those with renal failure or on dialysis.\nThe acute phase of NSTE-ACS is usually 1 to 3 months. The risk of \nrecurrence of ischemic events, STEMI or death is highest during this period. \nFollowing this, most patients assume a clinical course similar to that of \npatients with chronic stable angina. \nSeveral lifestyle modification measures and drug therapies have been shown \nto be effective in improving long-term outcome. However, they are underutilized. \nTherefore, health care providers should ensure that patients with NSTE-ACS \nreceive appropriate treatment post-hospital discharge and ensure that \npatients remain compliant to treatment. \n9.

It is the main cause of death worldwide whereby 6 million people die every \nyear as a consequence of this habit (WHO Tobacco Fact Sheet, 2016). \nSmoking has been classified as a chronic disease under Tobacco/Nicotine Depend-\nence in International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnostic code since 2015 \nand Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Associa-\ntion (DSM-IV Criteria).\nIn Malaysia, smoking kills around 20,000 people a year (Tobacco Atlas, 2015) while \nthe cost of treating three out of six chronic diseases related to tobacco was estimat-\ned around MYR 2.92 billion (Global Adults Tobacco Survey, 2011).\nThe National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2019 estimated that the prevalence \nof current tobacco smoker in Malaysia age 15 years and above was 21.3%, with \napproximately 4.8 million people with males being higher than females (male: \n40.5%, female: 1.2%). There was a small decline from the 2015 NHMS where the \nprevalence of active tobacco smoker was 22.8%, male was 43% and female was \n1.4%. \nThe Tobacco and E-cigarette Survey Among Adolescents (TECMA) 2016 has stated \nthe prevalence of smoker among adolescent age between 13 to 15 years was 14.8% \nas compared to 13.2% which was reported in the National Health and Morbidity \nSurvey (NHMS): Adolescent Health 2017. The prevalence of smoker among boys \ndropped from 26.1% in 2016 (TECMA) to 20.6% in 2017 (NHMS). However, the \nprevalence of smoker among girls increased from 2.4% in 2016 (TECMA) to 5.7% in \n2017 (NHMS). \nHence, the decision for treatment of smoking to be integrated with other chronic non \ncommunicable diseases was made during the World Health Organization Frame-\nwork Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) Steering Committee Meeting in \nDecember 2019 chaired by the honorable Health Minister of Malaysia.\nThe treatment for smoking is based on Clinical Practice Guideline: Treatment for \nTobacco Use Disorder 2016-(Tables A-D)",
