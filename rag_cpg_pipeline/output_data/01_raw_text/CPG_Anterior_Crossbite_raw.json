When \nit is due for updating, the head of the related specialty will be informed \nabout it. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will \nbe done on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised \nCPG. The systematic review methodology used by the Malaysia \nHealth Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed in \nreviewing the guidelines. \nEvery care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every \ndetail at the time of publication.

The recommendations were formulated taking into \nconsideration the best available evidence and local practices. Several \nimprovements have been introduced in this edition. The scope has \nbeen expanded to include new and updated information. In addition, \nclinical audit indicators have also been identified for the purpose of \nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes.\nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic \nReviews (CDSR) and Embase while full text journal articles were \nretrieved from these databases. The literature search was limited to \nhuman study, English language and published articles from 2012 to \nApril 2023. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Future \nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nAn example of the search strategy used can be found in Appendix 1. \nDetails of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the \nCPG Secretariat.\nThere were five (5) clinical questions which were assigned to members \nof the development group. The group members met a total of 13 \ntimes throughout the development of these guidelines. All retrieved \narticles were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme \n(CASP) checklist by at least two (2) members, presented in the form of \nevidence tables and discussed during group meetings. All statements \nand recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the \ndevelopment group and reviewers. This CPG is based on the findings \nof systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, observational \nstudies and case reports, with local practices taken into consideration. \nHowever, when there was lack of evidence, recommendations were \nbased on consensus of group members. Although ideally patients’ \nviews and preferences need to be considered in the development of \nCPGs, in this instance, it was not feasible.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US / \nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the formulation of recommendation was done using the principles",

            "text": "Management of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n1\n1.0\t\n INTRODUCTION\n \nAn anterior crossbite is defined as the misalignment of the upper and \nlower front teeth, with the lower teeth overlapping the upper teeth. This \nmay involve one or more anterior teeth and can occur during primary or \nmixed dentition phase, when the child has a combination of deciduous \nand permanent teeth. It is common for children with Class III skeletal \npattern to have anterior crossbite, especially crossbite of all the incisors.(1) \nAnterior crossbite in the primary dentition is rare but when it occurs, \nit is an indication that the child will develop a more severe Class III \nskeletal pattern as the child grows. Rarely this problem will need to be \ncorrected at the primary dentition stage; rather the child’s jaw growth \nand anterior bite will have to be monitored during the onset of early \npermanent dentition stage. \n \nThe prevalence of anterior crossbite differs among regions and \nethnicities. Between 2.2 and 11.0% of people in the European region \nare experiencing anterior crossbite. A study conducted in Shanghai \nfound that 10.5% of children between the ages of 7 and 9 had anterior \ncrossbite.(2) According to a cross-sectional study in Malaysia, 7.7% of \n12-year-old Malay students had an anterior crossbite.(3)\n \nAnterior crossbite in mixed dentition can lead to several functional and \naesthetic issues that can impact a child’s oral health and overall well-\nbeing. It can affect the child’s ability to bite and chew food properly. \nIn addition to functional challenges, the abnormal tooth alignment can \ncause tooth wear and enamel damage. Gingival recession and loss \nof periodontal attachment may also occur due to the improper forces \nexerted on the gingiva as a result of the malpositioned teeth. Furthermore, \nanterior crossbite can contribute to mandibular displacement, where \nthe lower jaw shifts to accommodate the malalignment. An anterior \ncrossbite also may reveal an underlying jaw problem that is best \naddressed at a young age, while the face and jaws are still developing.(4) \nTherefore, anterior crossbite should be treated early in order to avoid a \nmore complex and complicated treatment for the patient in the future.\nEarly intervention can address anterior crossbite in mixed dentition. \nDepending on the severity of the anterior crossbite, the child’s age, and \nother factors, various orthodontic appliances may be used, including \nremovable appliances, fixed appliances, or protraction facemasks and \nothers. These appliances gradually shift the misaligned teeth into their \nproper positions, promoting improved function and aesthetics. \n \nWith new developments in the management of patients with anterior \ncrossbite in mixed dentition, this CPG is updated to include latest \nevidence on the management of anterior crossbite of dental origin \nin mixed dentition using different treatment modalities such as lower",

It could \nbe due to:\n•\t crowding of teeth that can cause the maxillary incisors to be displaced \nlingually(1, 5)\n•\t presence of supernumerary teeth that interferes with the eruption of \nmaxillary tooth(1, 5)\n•\t traumatic injuries to the primary dentition can cause lingual \ndisplacement of the maxillary permanent tooth bud.(5)\n•\t trauma to permanent teeth can cause them to be displaced, resulting \nin anterior crossbite(5)\n•\t over-retained primary incisors can cause the permanent teeth to \nerupt lingually, leading to anterior crossbite(1, 5)\n2.2\t\nFunctional \nA change in anterior function during closure from centric relation to \ncentric occlusion due to habit of placing the mandible forward can lead \nto an anterior crossbite. It may be the result of premature occlusal \ninterference that forces the lower jaw to move forward or laterally to \nachieve maximum occlusion.(5)\n2.3\t\nSkeletal\nSkeletal anterior crossbite usually results from retarded maxillary \ngrowth or excessive mandibular growth or the combination of both. \nGenerally, the more anterior teeth in crossbite, the more severe the \nunderlying skeletal problem.(6)\nIt can be associated with the following factors: \n•\t strong familial inheritance contributes to the development of a Class \nIII skeletal pattern, which can lead to anterior crossbite(5)\n•\t scar tissue from cleft lip and palate repair can restrain the growth of \nthe maxilla, resulting in a narrow maxilla and anterior crossbite(5)\n•\t overdevelopment of mandible in craniofacial dysostosis, cleidocranial \ndysplasia and hormonal disturbances such as acromegaly and \ngigantism(5)\n•\t trauma or fractures to the jaws can cause skeletal abnormalities and \nanterior crossbite",
