The \nReview Committee was actively involved in the development process of \nthese guidelines. \nThe previous edition of the CPG on the Management of the Palatally Ectopic \nCanine (2004) was used as the basis for the development of these \nguidelines. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. In \naddition to the general text and photographic updates, new and updated \ninformation have been included. In addition, clinical audit indicators have \nalso been identified for the purpose of monitoring referrals. \nEvidences were updated from publications until June 2016. Literature search \nwas \ncarried \nout \nusing \nthe \nfollowing \nelectronic \ndatabases: \nPUBMED/MEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews; ISI Web of \nKnowledge; Health Technology Assessment and full text journal articles via \nOVID search engine.  In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles \nretrieved were searched to identify further studies.

Although, ideally patients’ views and \npreferences need to be considered in the development of CPGs, in this \ninstance, it was not feasible. Nevertheless, patient information leaflets would \nbe developed to facilitate the dissemination of important information to the \npublic. \nThe levels of evidence of the literature were graded using the modified \nversion from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), \nwhile the grading of recommendations was based on the modified version of \nthe Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). \nThe draft guidelines were reviewed by a team of external reviewers and were \nalso posted on the Ministry of Health, Malaysia and the Academy of \nMedicine, Malaysia websites for comments and feedbacks.

It has a long root and good bony support and is often referred to \nas the cornerstone of the maxillary arch.  Missing or impacted canine will \naffect the function and aesthetic appearance of the smile.  \nAn impacted tooth can be defined as the failure of a tooth to erupt within the \nspecified time. An impacted canine is a canine that is prevented from \nerupting into its normal functional position by bone, tooth or fibrous tissue. \nPalatally ectopic canine (PEC) is defined as the developmental dislocation \nof the upper canine to a palatal site often resulting in tooth impaction \nrequiring surgical and orthodontic treatments.1, level III\nThe erupting maxillary canine should be palpable in the buccal sulcus from \nage of 10 to 11 years.2, level II-3 Eruption of maxillary canines after 12.3 years \nof age in girls and 13.1 years of age in boys may be considered as late.3, level \nIII\nMaxillary canine is the second most commonly impacted tooth after the third \nmolar. The prevalence of impaction of maxillary canines ranges from 0.8% \nto 5.2%.4-5,7-8 level III; 6, level II-3  The crowns of ectopic maxillary canines are more \noften palatally (61%), while 34% are placed in the line of the arch and 4.5% \nare displaced buccally.9, level III Ectopic maxillary canines are twice as common \nin girls. In about 8% to 10% of cases, canine impactions occur bilaterally.10, \nlevel III Currently, there is no published data available on the prevalence of \nimpacted canines in the Malaysian population. \nThis CPG is focused on PEC based on the higher prevalence of its \noccurrence, which requires complex and multidisciplinary management \ncompared to buccally ectopic canine.  \n1.1 Aetiology \n \nMaxillary canine has the longest path of eruption into the occlusion and the \nlongest period of development. The aetiology of palatally ectopic maxillary \ncanine remains unclear. However, the following are some of the contributing \nfactors. These contributing factors may be either local or general. 11, level III",

Patient and parent \nshould be counseled on the various treatment options available. \n3.1 Interceptive Treatment by Extraction of Deciduous Canine\n \nTimely extraction of deciduous canine in patients aged 10 to 13 years with \nPEC has been found to normalise the eruptive path of canines within 12 \nmonths in 78% of cases 19, level II-1 and in 62% of cases. 31, level II-1  \nRecent studies also found similar results.

Irradiation \n Exposure or subjection to the action of radiation for diagnostic or \ntherapeutic purposes. \n  \n2. Ankylosis \n The periodontal ligament is obliterated in one or more localized areas, \nand a bony bridge is formed by penetration of alveolar bone into the \ncementum. \n \n3. Dilaceration \n A developmental distortion of the form of a tooth, whereby the root or \nthe apex forms an angle with the long axis of the tooth (the tooth \nappears sharply curved or bent). \n \n4. Iatrogenic \n An unfavorable response or condition caused by medical or dental \npersonnel, diagnostic tests or treatment procedures. \n \n5. Idiopathic \n Pain, disease or disorder of unknown etiology. \n \n6. CBCT \n Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a diagnostic imaging \nmodality that provides high-quality, accurate three-dimensional (3D) \nrepresentations of the osseous elements of the maxillofacial \nskeleton. \n \n7. CT \n Computerised Tomography (CT) is an imaging method that employs \na narrowly collimated radiographic beam that passes through the \nbody and is recorded by an array of scintillation detectors. \n \n8. Root resorption \n A loss of substance from the root tissues that normally are \nmineralized such as dentin or cementum. \n \n9. Extra-alveolar  \n Alveolar - the bone making up the alveolar process of the jaws. \n Extra- alveolar - located outside the bone making up the alveolar \nprocess of the jaws.",

Hertwig’s Epithelial Root Sheath \n Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath is an elongation of the cervical loop, \nwhich helps determine the shape, size, and number of roots and \nwhich influences the formation of dentin in the root area during the \ndevelopmental stages of a tooth. \n \n11. Ectopic \n Located away from the normal position. \n \n12.

Orthodontics \n The branch of dentistry concerned with facial growth with \ndevelopment of the dentition and occlusion, and with the diagnosis, \ninterception and treatment occlusal anomalies. \n \n14.
