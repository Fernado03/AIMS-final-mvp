A multidisciplinary review committee (RC) was \nactively involved during this CPG development process.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following databases: \nGuidelines International Network (G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, PUBMED, \nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and International Health \nTechnology Assessment websites. A search strategy to cover all aspects \non management of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was developed in the \nMedline database and adapted to other databases. Search strategies were a \ncombination of MeSH and keyword searches including abbreviations (refer to \nAppendix 1 on an example of Search Strategy). The search was restricted to \nhuman studies, literature published in the English language and the last ten \nyears. If the evidence was insufficient, the period of publication was extended \nfor another ten years. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature \nand guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. All searches \nwere conducted from May 2012 till November 2013. Literature searches were \nrepeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process. \nThe aim was to identify and include any further relevant papers published \nbefore 28 February 2014. Future CPG updates will consider evidence \npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be \nobtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other CPGs on ASD such as i) Guidelines on \nTreatment, Diagnosis and Clinical Intervention for Children and Young People \nwith Autism Spectrum Disorder (SIGN 98-2007), ii) AMS-MOH Clinical Practice \nGuidelines 1/2010 - Autism Spectrum Disorders in Pre-school Children,  iii) \nAutism Spectrum Disorder by the Ministry of Health New Zealand 2008, and \niv) Autism diagnosis in children and young people: Recognition, referral and \ndiagnosis of children and young people on the autism spectrum (NICE, 2011). \nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research \nand Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. \nA total of 27 clinical questions were developed under different sections. \nMembers of the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. \n(Refer to Appendix 2) The DG members met 23 times throughout the \ndevelopment of these guidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by \nat least two DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, \niv",

            "text": "1. \tIntroduction\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised \nby impairments in communication, behaviour and social functioning beginning \nin childhood. There is no local epidemiological study on ASD prevalence in \nMalaysia. However, in a feasibility study on the use of Modified Checklist for \nAutism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) among children of 18 to 36 months of age in child \nhealth clinics by Ministry of Health Malaysia, the prevalence of ASD in Malaysia \nwas approximately 1.6 in 1,000.1 In the USA, the overall prevalence of ASD is \n14.7 per 1,000 (one in 68) children aged 8 years and the prevalence shows an \nincreasing trend over the years.2 \nClinicians have been seeing an increasing number of children with speech delay \nand social communication difficulties who require further assessment. Children \nwith speech delay and behavioural issues are frequently placed in special \neducation classes without an accurate diagnosis. While waiting for diagnosis to \nbe established, these children should be referred for the relevant interventions.\nEarly diagnosis and prompt intervention of children with ASD is crucial for the \nbest outcome. The importance of early recognising and initiation of early referral \nto optimise the child’s potential must be emphasised. \nThis has prompted the need to produce a CPG for the wide usage of healthcare \nproviders in Malaysia as well as to provide assistance to parents of children with \nASD. It is hoped that this CPG can give a clear picture to primary care providers \nto direct these children in an efficient manner. Referral pathways to specialists \nand various interventionists have been outlined in this CPG in order to facilitate \nthis process.\n2.\t Risk Factors \nThe aetiology of ASD is unclear. It is multi-factorial which includes both genetic \nvulnerability and environmental factors. Only risk factors deemed important by \nthe DG and RC are discussed here.  \na. Advancing Parental Age\nParental age is among the most consistently studied risk factor and the risk for \nASD increases with parental age. \n\t\n● \nMaternal age:\n\t\n○\t >35 years old vs 25 - 29 years old (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.19 to \t \t\n1.45)3, level II-2\n\t\n○\t >40 years old vs <30 years old (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.86)4, level \nII-2\n1",
