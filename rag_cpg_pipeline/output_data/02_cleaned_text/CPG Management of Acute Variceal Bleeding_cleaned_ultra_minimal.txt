GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVE
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT
The clinical practice guidelines on the management of acute variceal bleeding
was developed by a team of gastroenterologists, a hepatologist and a surgeon.
The information sources and search was carried out using PubMed, Ovid and
other search engines using ‘variceal bleeding’, ‘oesophageal varices’, ‘gastric
varices’, ‘variceal bleeding AND therapy’, ‘variceal bleeding AND prophylaxis’
as keywords and included not only randomised clinical trials or meta-analyses,
but also other relevant articles. The recommendations were formulated based
on a systematic review of current medical literature, taking into consideration
local practice and feedbacks from members of MSGH, general practitioners,
physicians and general surgeons during the Annual Scientific Meeting and the
MSGH Clinical meeting. Where there is lack of evidence, the recommendation
was based on expert opinions, and adapting other international guidelines on
Acute Variceal Bleeding and the Proceedings of the Fourth Baveno International
Consensus Workshop on Portal Hypertension.
The draft guideline was posted on the Ministry of Health Malaysia website for
comment and feedback. This guideline has also been presented to the Technical
Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the Health Technology
Assessment and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health
Malaysia for review and approval.
OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this guideline is to present evidence-based
recommendations to assist health care professionals in the management of
acute variceal bleeding and not meant as a comprehensive overview of all
aspects of variceal bleeding.

INTRODUCTION
Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding accounts for 10-30% of upper
gastrointestinal haemorrhage and is a major cause of death in patients with
cirrhosis.1 The prevalence of oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis
varies from 24-81%.2-5 At the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis, oesophageal varices
are present in about 60% of decompensated and 30% of compensated patients.6
Variceal bleeding accounts for 6.4% of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in
Malaysia.7 Fifteen percent (105/699) of emergency endoscopy for upper
gastrointestinal bleeding performed in Selayang Hospital are due to acute
variceal bleeding (unpublished data). The aetiology of cirrhosis in Malaysia is
mainly due to hepatitis B or alcohol.8 The majority of patients who presented
with variceal bleeding are Chinese followed by Indians.
2.
BACKGROUND
2.1
Oesophageal Varices
Portal hypertension leads to the development of portosystemic collaterals
including gastroesophageal varices. The hepatic venous pressure gradient
(HVPG), defined as the difference between the wedged/occluded hepatic
venous pressure and the free hepatic venous pressure, is the most commonly
used parameter to measure portal pressure. The HVPG threshold for the
development of varices is 10mmHg (normal HVPG < 5mmHg). However, not
all patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient above this level have
oesophageal varices.9 Although the measurement of HVPG is reliable and is a
useful adjunct, the procedure is invasive and thus is not widely used in clinical
practice.
It is estimated that the annual risk of developing ‘de novo’ varices after initial
diagnosis of cirrhosis is about 5-8% per year.10,11 The appearance of
oesophageal varices has some correlation with the severity of liver disease
and portosystemic shunting as well as continued alcohol abuse.12-14 In alcoholic
liver disease, continued abstinence from alcohol may result in a decreasing
size or even disappearance of varices. Abstainers have a significantly higher
survival rate and a decrease probability of bleeding.

To date, there is no consensus on the definition of small varices. Amongst the
various classifications of oesophageal varices shown in Table 1,15-18 the grading
developed in Japanese studies is preferred (Level of evidence III). Varices
increase in size from small to large at an annual rate of 10-15%.11 Despite the
high occurrence of varices in cirrhotic patients, only 30% of patients with varices
will experience variceal haemorrhage.4,5 The risk of bleeding appears to be
greatest within the first year after diagnosis. Mortality of the first bleeding episode
is high and ranges between 30% and 50% within 6 weeks;19 mortality from
uncontrolled bleeding in the first instance is between 5-8%.20 The risk factors
for the first episode of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients include the severity
of the liver dysfunction, the size of the varices (large greater than small), and
the presence of endoscopic red wale signs.4,17,21 Another important risk factor
to consider is the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). It is now well
accepted that variceal bleeding will not occur if the HVPG is below 12mmHg.22
Once this 12mmHg HVPG threshold is crossed, bleeding is expected to occur
at some point.
Patients who survived the first bleed from oesophageal varices are at a
significant risk of recurrent haemorrhage: 70% of patients will experience
recurrent haemorrhage and about a third of further bleeding episodes are
fatal.4,23 Up to fifty percent of recurrent haemorrhage occurs within the first 6
weeks after the index bleed.20 The risk of re-bleeding is highest during the first
five days, decreases slowly over the first 6 weeks, and becomes virtually equal
to that before the index bleed after the sixth week.19 Risk factors predictive of
re-bleeding include the degree of hepatic decompensation, age greater than
60, severity of initial bleed, renal insufficiency, level of portal pressure, size of
varices, active bleeding at the time of initial endoscopy and the presence of
hepatoma.20,23
Recommendation for classification of oesophageal varices
The Japanese classification is the preferred grading scale for the staging
of oesophageal varices.
(Grade C)
2.2
Gastric Varices
Gastric varices account for approximately 20-30% of cases of variceal bleeding.
The prevalence of gastric varices in patients with portal hypertension varies
from 6-78% and approximately 25% of gastric varices bleed during lifetime.24
Primary gastric varices are varices detected at the time of the first endoscopy,
whereas, secondary gastric varices are those which occur within two years of
eradication of oesophageal varices. Gastric varices occur five times more often
in patients with oesophageal varices that have previously bled than in those
that have never bled. Although gastric variceal haemorrhage occurs less
frequently than oesophageal variceal haemorrhage, the severity of bleeding
and mortality, especially with fundal varices, is greater.25
The preferred classification of gastric varices is based on location, size and
endoscopic features of the varices:24,26 gastro-oesophageal varices (GOV) and
isolated gastric varices (IGV). GOV extend beyond the gastro-oesophageal
junction (OGJ) and are always associated with oesophageal varices. They are
further subdivided into Type 1 (GOV I): these varices are a continuation of
oesophageal varices and extend for 2-5 cm below the OGJ along the lesser
curvature of the stomach. Type 2 (GOV II): these varices extend below the
OGJ towards the fundus of the stomach. Gastric varices in the absence of
oesophageal varices are termed isolated gastric varices (IGV). Depending on
the location, they are subdivided into Type 1 (IGV I): these are located in the
fundus of the stomach and fall short of the cardia by a few centimetres. Type 2
(IGV II): these include isolated ectopic varices and can present anywhere in
the stomach.
3.
PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS
3.1
Oesophageal Varices
Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is therapy given to patients with known
varices to prevent the first episode of variceal haemorrhage. Given the high
risk of initial haemorrhage and the high rate of mortality from the first bleeding
episode, strategies for prevention of the first bleed are therefore important.
3.1.1 Pharmacological Therapy for Oesophageal Varices
Non-selective ß-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol and nadolol are
widely used in the prevention of the initial bleeding episode. Non-selective
rather than selective beta-blockers are more appropriate as blocking ß1 activity
causes splanchnic vasoconstriction (by means of reflex á-adrenergic receptors)
and by eliminating ß2-receptor mediated splanchnic arterial vasodilation,
splanchnic blood flow is reduced.
Beta-blockers have been shown by 3 meta-analyses to statistically reduce the
relative risk of bleeding by approximately 45% with a trend towards reducing
mortality.27-29 The average number of patients that are needed to treat to prevent
one bleeding episode is 11. The benefit of beta-blockers has been proven in
patients with moderate or large varices (>5mm), either with good or poor liver
function.11 Although beta-blocker prophylaxis reduced the rate of variceal
bleeding in patients with small oesophageal varices,30 there is insufficient
evidence to support treatment of patients with small varices. Beta-blockers
have also been shown to prevent bleeding from portal hypertensive
gastropathy.31
A cost-effectiveness analysis in the USA supports the use of propranolol as
cost-effective in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.32 Beta-blocker
therapy should be maintained for life as bleeding may occur after stopping
treatment.33 However, the side-effect profile for beta-blocker therapy is
considerable: 15-25% of cirrhotic patients are intolerant or have
contraindications to beta-blockers that preclude its use.34
Other pharmacological alternatives which have been evaluated include nitrates.
Although nitrates have been shown to reduce portal pressure, it can potentially
worsen the vasodilative haemodynamics typically found in cirrhotic patients.
Nitrates were ineffective to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with
contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers and should not be used as
monotherapy to prevent the index variceal bleed.34 Furthermore, a comparative
study between isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) with propranolol for the prevention
of variceal bleeding showed a higher long-term mortality in patients over 50
years of age receiving ISMN.35 It has been suggested that the higher mortality
observed when nitrates was compared to beta-blockers were probably due to
a beneficial effect of beta-blockers rather than a real detrimental effect of nitrates.36
Recommendations for pharmacological therapy for oesophageal
varices
Non-selective beta-blockers is the best available modality for primary
prophylaxis at present.
(Grade A)
3.1.2 Endoscopic Therapy for Oesophageal Varices
Endoscopic treatment modalities available include variceal ligation and injection
sclerotherapy. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is based on the concept that bleeding
from varices is halted by thrombosis of the bleeding varix by intravariceal or
paravariceal injection of a sclerosant. The most commonly used sclerosants
are sodium tetradecyl sulphate (thrombovar) and ethanolamine oleate.
There is little, if any, role for endoscopic sclerotherapy in the prevention of the
index variceal bleed. A meta-analysis of 20 randomised trials comparing
prophylactic endoscopic sclerotherapy with no treatment showed significant
heterogeneity between the trials to draw firm conclusions.37 The risk of sideeffects of sclerotherapy probably outweighs the potential benefits and two
studies suggest superiority of propranolol over sclerotherapy.38, 39
Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is achieved by suction and ligating the varix
in a banding device attached to the tip of the endoscope, similar to the technique
used for ligation of internal haemorrhoids. Multiband ligators are now available.
An initial meta-analysis of 4 randomised clinical trials40-43 comparing endoscopic
ligation and beta-blockers suggested that ligation is superior to beta-blockers
in the prevention of variceal bleeding but the risk for mortality was similar in
both groups.44 A further meta-analysis of 5 trials failed to show significant
differences between endoscopic ligation and beta-blockers either for bleeding
or survival.36 In a more recent study, although a significantly higher failure rate
of variceal bleeding and mortality was noted in patients on beta-blockers
compared to those receiving prophylactic EVL, the bleeding rate in the EVL
group is unusually low with a relatively short period of follow-up.45 The
comparison between EVL and beta-blockers versus EVL monotherapy for
primary prophylaxis showed no difference between the two groups.46, 47
Non-selective beta-blockers is the best available modality for primary
prophylaxis at present (Level of evidence I). Prophylactic ligation may be
indicated for patients who are intolerant or have contraindications to betablockers.
3.2
Gastric Varices
The risk of first bleeding from gastric varices is no greater than that from
oesophageal varices. Data on prevention of the first bleeding in patients with
gastric varices is sparse. It is conceivable that beta-blocker therapy is equally
effective in this situation. The efficacy of cyanoacrylate in these patients remains
controversial.48
4.
SCREENING ENDOSCOPY
Current guidelines for the primary prophylaxis of oesophageal varices
recommend universal screening endoscopy in patients with cirrhosis to identify
those who could benefit from therapy. The American College of Gastroenterology
and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease advocate screening
endoscopy every other year in patients with cirrhosis not known to have varices.
Patients with small varices on initial endoscopy should be screened for
enlargement of varices every 1-2 years.26 A recent analysis by Spiegel et al.49
suggests that empiric beta-blocker therapy may be a more cost-effective
approach in patients with compensated cirrhosis, whereas Arguedas et al.50
found that this strategy was cost-effective only in patients with decompensated
cirrhosis. Until there are more studies comparing screening-directed versus
empiric beta-blocker prophylaxis, the recent data should not immediately affect
our current practice.
Recommendations for screening endoscopy
Screening endoscopy at the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis and every 2
years in patients not known to have varices.
(Grade C)
5.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE VARICEAL BLEEDING
The report of the Baveno IV Consensus Workshop on portal hypertension states
the time frame for the acute variceal bleeding episode as 5 days and failure to
control bleeding as the need to change specific therapy.51
5.1
General Management
Acute variceal bleeding is a medical emergency that should be managed under
intensive care facilities by a team of experienced medical staff including
endoscopists, hepatologists, surgeons and nurses. Therapy is aimed at correcting
hypovolumic shock and at achieving haemostasis at the bleeding site. This would
be instituted by aggressive resuscitation to restore haemodynamic stability. Two
large bore intravenous lines should be in place. Blood volume restitution,
preferably packed red blood cells, should be transfused cautiously and
conservatively to keep the haemoglobin ideally around 8g/dL or haemocrit of
24%.52 Overtransfusion should be avoided as this can increase portal pressures
and exacerbate further bleeding. If the patient is haemodynamically unstable,
elective intubation for airway protection should be considered. Pharmacotherapy
to reduce portal pressure should be instituted and emergency endoscopy
performed to establish the diagnosis and location of the bleeding site.
5.2
Antibiotics in Acute Variceal Bleeding
Bacterial infections are seen in about 20% of cirrhotics presenting with upper
gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours.53,54 The incidence of sepsis increases to
almost 66% at two weeks.50-57 Development of bacterial infection is associated
with high mortality and variceal re-bleeding.54,55 Antibiotic prophylaxis has been
shown to reduce the rate of infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and rebleeding.56-60 In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis was clearly proven in a meta-analysis
to significantly increase the survival rate.61 Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis for 7
days should be considered the standard of care in cirrhotic patients with upper
gastrointestinal bleeding, irrespective of the type of haemorrhage (variceal or nonvariceal) or the presence or absence of ascites (Level of evidence I). As to the
choice of antibiotic, either third generation cephalosporins given intravenously or
oral quinolones (norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin) are generally recommended.
Recommendations for antibiotics in acute variceal bleeding
Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis for 7 days should be considered the
standard of care in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding,
irrespective of the type of haemorrhage (variceal or non-variceal) or the
presence or absence of ascites.
(Grade A)
5.3
Pharmacological Therapy for Acute Variceal Bleeding
Pharmacologic treatment is aimed at arresting haemorrhage by decreasing
pressure and blood flow within the oesophageal varices, thus, allowing
haemostasis at the bleeding points. Vasoactive drugs have been shown to
control acute variceal bleeding in about 80% of patients.62-68 Vasoactive therapy
can be used empirically when variceal bleeding seems likely on clinical grounds.
The current recommendation (Level of evidence I) is to start a vasoactive
drug as early as possible from the time of admission or even upon the patient’s
transfer to the hospital.62,63 The agents available are vasopressin (either alone
or in combination with nitroglycerine) or its analogues and somatostatin or its
analogues. The selection of the vasoactive drug is highly dependent on
availability and the treating clinician’s familiarity with each.
Vasopressin was the first vasoactive agent used in the treatment of acute
variceal bleeding. It does, however, have significant systemic side-effects which
include myocardial and mesenteric ischaemia and infarction.69 The addition of
nitroglycerine to vasopressin enhances its efficacy and reduces the
cardiovascular side-effects.70, 71
Terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue with fewer side-effects and a longer
half-life than vasopressin, is effective in controlling acute variceal bleeding.72,73
Terlipressin is administered as IV injections of 2mg bolus and 1mg every four to
six hours for 2-5 days. A meta-analysis demonstrated that terlipressin was
associated with a 34% relative risk reduction in mortality compared to placebo.72
Somatostatin and its synthetic analogues, octreotide and vapreotide, control acute
variceal bleeding in up to 80% of patients and are generally considered to be
equivalent to terlipressin but superior to vasopressin for the control of acute
variceal haemorrhage.73 Somatostatin is given as an IV 250mcg bolus followed
by 250mcg/hour infusion. Octreotide is administered as a bolus injection of 50mcg
followed by an infusion at a rate of 50mcg/hour. Somatostatin or octreotide therapy
should be maintained for 5 days to prevent early re-bleeding.
In acute variceal bleeding, terlipressin may have an added advantage as it can
potentially reverse hepatorenal syndrome.74 In addition, terlipressin has been
shown to have a more sustained haemodynamic effect compared to treatment
with octreotide.75
Recommendations for pharmacological therapy for acute variceal
haemorrhage
A vasoactive drug should be started as early as possible from the time of
admission or even upon the patient’s transfer to the hospital. (Grade A)
6.
MANAGEMENT OF OESOPHAGEAL VARICEAL BLEEDING
6.1
Endoscopic Therapy
Endoscopic sclerotherapy stops bleeding in 80-90% of patients with acute
variceal haemorrhage.76-78 There was no difference between vasoactive drugs
and endoscopic sclerotherapy in failure to control bleeding, early re-bleeding
and mortality.79-81 However, adverse events such as oesophageal ulceration
and stricture were significantly more severe with sclerotherapy. Control of
bleeding may also be achieved by injection of tissue adhesives e.g. histoacryl/
cyanoacrylate glue. Re-bleeding rates are similar to sclerosants but there is
also a higher risk of complications and damage to the endoscopic instrument.
This should only be performed by experienced endoscopists when haemostasis
has not been achieved.
Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is more effective than sclerotherapy in
controlling acute oesophageal variceal bleeding but without a survival
advantage.82-85 EVL is favoured in most settings because it leads to fewer
complications and a survival advantage was demonstrated in one study.85
Technically, banding may be difficult at times because of limited visualisation
from bleeding and sclerotherapy is used as it is easier to perform in this setting.
The use of endoscopic therapy alone in the treatment of acute oesophageal
variceal bleeding has been challenged as pharmacological therapy is as
effective as sclerotherapy, but with significantly less side-effects.86 However, a
meta-analysis on the efficacy of therapeutic regimens in acute variceal bleeding
showed that ligation was significantly more successful than pharmacological
therapy in the control of ongoing variceal bleeding.82 Therefore, EVL is
recommended for patients with acute variceal bleeding (Level of evidence I).
An important newer approach has been the combination of a vasoactive agent
and endoscopic therapy. The addition of vasoactive drugs for a period of five
days has been shown to facilitate endoscopy, improve control of bleeding, reduce
5-day re-bleeding rate and transfusion requirements,87-90 but with no effect on
mortality.91 Combination therapy was beneficial both in low-risk and high-risk
patients,92 even if administered just after the endoscopic procedure.11,93,94
Recommendations for endoscopic therapy for acute oesophageal
variceal haemorrhage
Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is recommended for patients with acute
variceal bleeding.
(Grade A)
6.2
Balloon Tamponade
Although generally considered effective for stopping bleeding,95 balloon
tamponade is known to have a high re-bleeding rate when the balloon is
decompressed and is associated with serious complications such as ulceration,
perforation and aspiration pneumonia. In addition, sclerotherapy achieved a
higher rate of initial haemostasis compared to balloon tamponade.96,97 Thus,
this should only be considered if facilities for endoscopy are not available prior
to transfer to a tertiary centre or as a temporary ‘bridge’ for a maximum of 24
hours until definitive treatment can be instituted. This should be used in
conjunction with pharmacological therapy. The balloon should be kept in the
refrigerator, taken out only at the time of the procedure and inserted by a
personnel who is familiar with the procedure.
6.3
Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts (TIPS)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) is effective in the
treatment of acute variceal bleeding with a success rate of over 90% in arresting
haemorrhage.98,99 The main limiting factors to the use of TIPS are the high
morbidity and mortality:100,101 the 30-day mortality approaches 100% in patients
with advanced liver disease, ongoing sepsis and multi-organ failure.102
Therefore, the most widely accepted indication for TIPS is as a rescue therapy
for uncontrolled variceal bleeding after combined pharmacological and
endoscopic therapy (Level of evidence II). Further studies are required to
define the role of early TIPS placement in patients with haemodynamically
defined (using HVPG measurement) high-risk patients.103
Recommendations for Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic
Shunts (TIPS)
TIPS is indicated as a rescue therapy for uncontrolled variceal bleeding
after combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy.
(Grade B)

Surgical Therapy
Surgical options include oesophageal transection with or without
devascularisation, portosystemic shunts and liver transplantation. Regardless
of the choice of the surgical technique, morbidity and mortality are high: the
30-day mortality associated with emergency surgical procedures is nearly 80%.98
Similar to TIPS, the role of surgical therapy in the management of acute variceal
bleed has been relegated to salvage haemostatic therapy (Level of evidence
II). Liver transplantation is probably only appropriate for liver transplant
candidates who bleed while on the waiting list.

Secondary Prophylaxis
Secondary prophylaxis is the prevention of recurrent bleeding after a first
episode variceal bleed. Secondary prophylaxis should be started from the sixth
day of the index variceal bleed.51
6.5.1 Pharmacological Therapy
Secondary prophylactic therapy with pharmacological therapy is based on the
assumption that a sustained reduction in portal pressure reduces the incidence
of variceal re-bleeding. Beta-blockers are still the mainstay of
pharmacotherapy.104-106 A meta-analysis of 12 randomised controlled trials
comparing non-selective beta-blockers to either no treatment or placebo showed
a statistically significant reduction in the risk of recurrent bleeding and survival
advantage.107 The incidence of recurrent variceal bleeding was 42.7% in the
placebo group and 32% in the beta-blocker group, a reduction in the risk of
bleeding by one third, and mortality from 27% to 20%.11,108 The number of
patients needed to treat in order to prevent one re-bleeding episode is 5, and
the number needed to treat in order to prevent a death is 14. Intolerance to
propranolol leads to discontinuation of treatment in 30% of patients. Although
the addition of isosorbide mononitrate to beta-blockers for secondary
prophylaxis appears to be superior to beta-blocker monotherapy in the
prevention of variceal re-bleeding, survival benefit was not demonstrated.108
Therefore, non-selective beta-blockers should be used for secondary
prophylaxis (Level of evidence I).
Recommendations for secondary prophylaxis – pharmacological
therapy
Non-selective beta-blockers should be used for secondary prophylaxis.
(Grade A)
6.5.2 Endoscopic Therapy
For the prevention of variceal re-bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy is
performed every 10-14 days until the varices are obliterated, which typically
requires 5 or 6 sessions. Sclerotherapy proved more effective than placebo in
terms of prevention of variceal re-bleeding and mortality.109 However, endoscopic
variceal band ligation has superseded sclerotherapy in the prevention of
recurrent oesophageal variceal haemorrhage (Level of evidence I) because
the risk of re-bleeding is lower than sclerotherapy (approximately 25% vs. 30%
respectively at one year), causes fewer complications, requires fewer sessions
to eradicate the varices and has a survival benefit.83,110-113 Similar to
sclerotherapy, EVL is performed every 10 to 14 days until the varices are
eradicated, which usually takes 3 or 4 sessions. The addition of sclerotherapy
to ligation has not been shown to be advantageous:114,115 a higher incidence of
oesophageal stricture was noted in the group who had both sclerotherapy and
ligation.116 A more recent meta-analysis confirmed earlier reports that the
combination of EVL and sclerotherapy is not superior to EVL alone in the risk
of oesophageal variceal re-bleeding, death or time to variceal obliteration.117
Comparison of beta-blockers and isosorbide mononitrate with endoscopic
variceal band ligation revealed either no significant difference in the variceal
re-bleeding episodes or in survival,118,119 or significantly less variceal re-bleeding
but a higher death rate in the EVL group.120 In one study, a higher variceal rebleeding rate was noted in the EVL group as compared with pharmacological
therapy (49% vs. 33% respectively).121 However, pharmacological therapy was
found to be effective largely in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. Noteworthy,
the risk of recurrent bleeding and of death was significantly lower in patients
who had a haemodynamic response to therapy (defined as a reduction in the
HVPG by more than 20% of the baseline value or to less than 12mmHg).
Currently, there is not enough evidence to support the use of the targeted
reduction of HVPG in routine clinical practice.122
Recommendations for secondary prophylaxis – endoscopic therapy
Endoscopic variceal band ligation has superseded sclerotherapy in the
prevention of recurrent oesophageal variceal haemorrhage. (Grade A)
6.5.3 Combination of Pharmacological and Endoscopic Therapy
The combination of endoscopic therapy and pharmacologic therapy for secondary
prophylaxis is attractive and may improve the results of either form of therapy
alone. Studies comparing the use of sclerotherapy and beta-blockers showed a
lower incidence of variceal re-bleeding than beta-blocker monotherapy but with
no improvement in survival.123,124 The combination of ligation plus ß-adrenergic
blockers and sucralfate (EVL to reduce variceal size, nadolol to lower portal
pressure and sucralfate to heal oesophageal ulcers) was compared with EVL
alone.125 Triple therapy proved more effective in terms of prevention of variceal
re-bleeding; however, no significant difference in death rate was identified.
Combination therapy involving endoscopic variceal ligation and beta-adrenergic
blockers is probably the preferred treatment but warrants additional trials.51
6.5.4 Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts (TIPS)
TIPS is more effective than endoscopic therapy for the prevention of variceal rebleeding with 8-18% recurrent variceal bleeding rate at one year:126-129 shunt
dysfunction either due to occlusion or stenosis is almost always the cause. However,
TIPS is associated with the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in at least 25%
of patients after the procedure,130,131 lacks survival benefit over endoscopic
therapy,132-134 is more costly than pharmacological therapy135 and therefore, should
not be used as a first-choice treatment for secondary prophylaxis.
6.5.5 Surgical Therapy
Prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding with surgery may be more effective
than pharmacological or endoscopic therapy in patients with preserved synthetic
function provided that it is performed by an experienced surgeon.136-139 Portal
blood flow-preserving procedures such as selective shunts or devascularisation
procedures appears to be better than decompressive surgical shunts with rebleeding rate of 6% vs. 14.3% and postoperative encephalopathy of 6% vs.
21% respectively.140,141 In addition, selective shunts do not exclude the patients
for future liver transplantation.
In comparison with TIPS, surgical shunts are significantly more invasive but
placement of TIPS resulted in higher re-bleeding rate142 and cost143 than surgical
shunt due to subsequent occlusion and re-bleeding with no significant effect
on mortality. TIPS is most suited for patients with Child’s B or C cirrhosis,
particularly those who are candidates for liver transplantation while surgical
shunts should be limited to patients with Child’s A cirrhosis.144
Secondary prophylaxis with TIPS or surgical shunt is preferred for patients
who are non-compliant with pharmacological or endoscopic therapy (Level of
evidence II).
Recommendations for secondary prophylaxis – surgical therapy
Secondary prophylaxis with TIPS or surgical shunt is preferred for patients
who are non-compliant with pharmacological or endoscopic therapy.

MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE GASTRIC VARICEAL BLEEDING
The treatment goals for acute gastric variceal bleeding are the same as for
oesophageal varices: to control acute bleeding and prevent re-bleeding.
Indications for treatment are: active bleeding from varices, stigmata of recent
bleeding episode on gastric varices, history of a previous bleeding episode
and presence of gastric varices as the only source of bleeding.
7.1
Gastro-Oesophageal Varices (GOV) Type 1
Treat as for oesophageal varices (Level of evidence II).
Recommendations for GOV type 1
Treat as for oesophageal varices.
(Grade B)
7.2
Gastro-Oesophageal Varices (GOV) Type 2 and Isolated Gastric Varices (IGV)
7.2.1 Endoscopic Therapy
Injection of cyanoacrylate glue has been shown to achieve haemostasis in 90%
of acutely bleeding gastric varices145-147 and has been shown to be better than
alcohol and band ligation.148,149 It is important to ensure the intravariceal position
of the needle. Histoacryl is mixed with lipiodol in a ratio of 0.5:0.8ml. Histoacryl
should be injected in a slow and controlled fashion and should not exceed 2ml
as there is a risk of thrombotic complications including pulmonary embolism.
These procedures should only be performed by experienced endoscopists.
For acute GOV Type 2 and IGV: injection with cyanoacrylate (Level of evidence I).
Recommendations for GOV type 2 and IGV
For acute bleeding: injection with cyanoacrylate.
(Grade A)
7.2.2 Balloon Tamponade
Immediate control of bleeding from all types of gastric varices except IGV II
can be obtained by using the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube with the gastric
balloon held under traction.
7.2.3 Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts (TIPS)
This is the treatment modality when bleeding GOV is not responsive to
endoscopic and pharmacological treatment.
7.2.4 Secondary Prophylaxis
Data on long-term outcome after GOV obliteration are scanty. In general,
recurrence after obliteration is much lower in patients with gastric varices than
in patients with oesophageal varices except for patients with fundal varices.150
Cyanoacrylate glue was shown to be more effective than alcohol sclerotherapy
for the control of variceal re-bleeding (100% vs. 44% respectively).149 TIPS and
surgical intervention are the other therapeutic options for gastric variceal rebleeding. TIPS has been shown to be effective in patients with gastric varices
in terms of re-bleeding and survival.151,152
8.
CONCLUSION
The current first choice treatment in patients with oesophageal varices who have
not bled is prophylactic non-selective beta-blocker therapy. Therapy with betablockers is cheap, easy to administer, and significantly reduces the risk of index
variceal haemorrhage. Only patients with Grade 3 (large varices), Grade 2
(moderate varices) with endoscopic red wale signs or Child’s C cirrhosis should
be offered this therapy. Typically, the initial dose of propranolol is 20mg twice
daily with the dose titrated to achieve a 25% decrement in resting pulse rate or a
pulse rate of 55-60 bpm. Endoscopic variceal band ligation may be an alternative
for patients who cannot tolerate, or have contraindications to beta-blockers.
The best approach for patients with acute variceal bleeding is the combination
of vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy. Terlipressin is administered as
2mg IV bolus and 1mg every six hours for 2-5 days. Somatostatin is given as
an IV 250mcg bolus followed by 250mcg/hour infusion and octreotide is
administered as a bolus injection of 50mcg followed by an infusion at a rate of
50mcg/hour. Somatostatin or octreotide therapy should be maintained for 5
days to prevent early re-bleeding.
Regarding endoscopic therapy, EVL is preferred but sclerotherapy may be used
depending on the endoscopist’s experience and the particular circumstances
found during endoscopy.
The first-line treatment for prevention of recurrent variceal haemorrhage is betablockers, endoscopic variceal ligation or the combination of beta-blockers and
endoscopic variceal ligation. TIPS or surgical shunt appears to be more
appropriate for patients who are non-compliant or refractory to pharmacological
and endoscopic therapy.
