FOREWORD
by Tan Sri Dato' Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah,
Director General of Health, Malaysia
Management of any chronic disease requires a concerted effort with the
participation of all stake holders starting with the patients themselves and,
clinical healthcare professionals as well as public health policymakers. This is
even more important in the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
An optimum result can only be achieved with a holistic approach and active
patient participation with the support of appropriate diabetes education
and lifestyle modification. In addition to its negative impact on the quality
of life and health care costs, diabetes also increases the economic burden of
individuals, families and communities and, affects national productivity.
I note that there has been a recent explosion of advances made in the
management of diabetic complications. The use of new technology and findings
from landmark trials have changed clinical pathways and recommendations in
the way T2DM is managed. This has been reflected in the latest Clinical Practice
Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of T2DM (6th Edition). These guidelines
also focus on preventing and reducing diabetes-related complications,
thereby improving clinical outcomes. This CPG will form a valuable resource
for healthcare professionals from primary to tertiary care levels, to deliver the
best possible care for their patients, from disease prevention to treatment of
complications.
In this networked age, we should no longer be working in silos and I would
like to reaffirm the importance and recognition of a multidisciplinary approach
in managing T2DM. I have been a champion for embracing technology and
innovation – and note that there is emphasis on the potential to use mobile
apps and other forms of technological advances / telemedicine to improve
diabetes self-management. The importance of this is even greater now in the
context of the new norm forced on everyone by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The breadth and depth of material covered reflects the commitment and
the dedication of the CPG committee, despite the difficulties encountered
during the Covid-19 pandemic. I would like to congratulate the chairs and the
members for their hard work and it is my sincere wish that this document will
further elevate the standard of diabetes care and reduce the burden of T2DM
in our country.

FOREWORD
by Chairpersons of T2DM Clinical Practice Guidelines,
6th edition taskforce
These are exciting times for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
and a time for concern. The past 5 years have seen amazing breakthroughs that
give hope for people with T2DM. Several Cardiovascular Outcome trials (CVOTs)
from 2 new classes of glucose-lowering agents have shown cardiovascular (CV)
protection, beyond glucose.
On the other hand, prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia continues to rise unabated.
The 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) shows a prevalence
of 18.3% (for adults >18 years of age), a 4% increase from 2015; 48.6% were
undiagnosed. In addition, ~5.0% of our young Malaysians between 18-29 years
are also diabetic. It is worrying to see this trend. The frequent co-existence with
other well-known comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, dyslipidaemia, overweight/
obesity further complicates the situation.
The 5th edition of our Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of
T2DM 2015, was detailed and comprehensive. Our aspiration was to build on
the previous CPG. Since then, there have been major advances; in therapeutics,
nutrition, technology as well as, digital health.
The landmark CVOTs have consistently demonstrated positive beneficial CV
outcomes in those with either established or at high risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Another exciting advance has been the discovery of a 2nd
therapeutic class of agent, apart from the renin-angiotensin system blockers,
to directly reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD remains
the largest contributor of new patients requiring dialysis in Malaysia and,
recent renal outcome trials definitively show positive outcomes for prevention
of progression to end-stage renal failure and reduction of albuminuria. More
exciting data may be forthcoming with ongoing dedicated trials investigating
effects of these glucose-lowering agents, on heart failure and prevention
of kidney disease not only in people with diabetes but also, in nondiabetic
individuals.
These results have led to paradigm shifts, changing practices as we move
forward. The objective of these guidelines is to reflect the uptake of this
new data in clinical decision making and therefore, provide evidence-based
recommendations to assist healthcare providers in identifying, diagnosing and
managing our patients with T2DM. Some of the other notable updates, include
additional sections on current hot topics; e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) and periodontal disease. The landmark CVOTs have been consolidated
and summarised in Appendix 8.
T2DM is not a stand-alone disease instead reaching across a spectrum of other
non-communicable diseases. Hence, in this updated guideline, we expanded our
taskforce to include colleagues from other specialities; including nephrology,
neurology, gastroenterology-hepatology, cardiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry
and dental surgery. The committee hopes that this combination of expertise
has enhanced the recommendations in this CPG to further improve clinical
decision making.
The development of these guidelines extended into an extraordinary situation
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through it, the hardworking committee
members of the taskforce, including our reviewers, persevered with continuous
and timely discussions to reach consensus where required through use of
technology/remote communication, enabling its completion. To this, we extend
our appreciation and gratitude, and commend their unwavering commitment
to deliver the best evidence-based standard of care to our patients with T2DM.

Guidelines development
The guidelines development task force consisted of endocrinologists, paediatric
endocrinologists, family medicine specialists, public health physicians, general
physicians and dietitians. Where relevant, experts from different specialties
were also included to review and update certain sub-sections within these
guidelines. These included a nephrologist, neurologist, gastroenterologisthepatologist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, psychiatrist, dental surgeon,
pharmacist and diabetes educator.
The previous edition of the CPG on Management of T2DM 2015 was used as
the basis for the development of this present guideline.
Literature search was carried out at the following electronic databases:
PUBMED, Medline, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and
Journal full text via OVID search engine. In addition, the reference lists of all
relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies.
Reference was also made to the lastest edition of other guidelines on the
management of T2DM including guidelines developed by the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, American
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists’, American College of Endocrinology,
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Global Guideline for Type 2 Diabetes,
the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), National Institute
For Health and Care Excellence (NICE); Malaysian CPG on Management of
Obesity, Canadian Diabetes Association, The Royal Australian College of
General Practitioners and Diabetes Australia, Malaysian Dietitians’ Association,
Trafford NHS Healthcare Trust and Joint British Diabetes Societies Inpatient
Care Group.
These updated guidelines also include the latest cardiovascular outcome trials
(CVOTs) and findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses in literature,
all whilst taking into consideration local practices.
Clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of
the task force were assigned individual topics within these subgroups. All
literature retrieved were critically appraised, presented and discussed during
group meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were
agreed by the task force members. Where the evidence was insufficient, the
recommendations were derived by consensus of the task force members.
The articles were graded using the criteria used by the Canadian Task Force
on the Periodic Health Examination, while the grading of recommendation in
this guideline was standardised with the previous edition of the T2DM CPG
(5th edition) i.e. following the American Heart Association system, for easy
comparison. The rationale for the committee to do so is that the format for
both are familiar to our healthcare professionals and facilitates the CPG’s ease
of use.
The draft guidelines as a whole were submitted for external review by experts
in endocrinology (adult and paediatric) and family medicine, whilst relevant
sub-sections by consult with a neurologist, nephrologist, gastroenterologisthepatologist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, diabetes educator, psychiatrist
and dental surgeon. These guidelines were then presented to the Technical
Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Health Technology
Assessment and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia
for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION:
TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS,
THE DISEASE
1.1 Background
• Plasma glucose abnormalities may span a progressive continuum ranging
from prediabetes, consisting of impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) and impaired
glucose tolerance (IGT), to overt diabetes mellitus.
• Prediabetes usually does not cause symptoms and is characterised by
elevated plasma glucose levels that fall below the threshold to diagnose
diabetes. Prediabetes is an important risk factor for future diabetes and
cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is a potentially reversible condition with
lifestyle modification.
• T2DM is the most common form of diabetes mellitus, accounting for >90% of
all cases of adult-onset diabetes mellitus in Malaysia. Both prediabetes and
diabetes commonly coexist with other non-communicable diseases namely
hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity.
• With a high and increasing global, and local prevalence, T2DM represents a
huge socio-economic burden due to increased morbidity from accelerated
vascular complications and premature death.
• T2DM is characterised by progressive decline in beta-cell function associated
with insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue.
› The insulin resistant state results in increased hepatic glucose output and
reduced utilisation of glucose by various organs contributing to fasting
hyperglycaemia and between meal hyperglycaemia.
› Impaired intestinal incretin secretion causes compromised meal-related
insulin secretion and glucagon suppression contributing to postprandial
hyperglycaemia.
› Excessive renal tubular reabsorption of glucose further contributes to
hyperglycaemia.
• T2DM is an important risk factor for CVD and microvascular complications
such as nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy. Other non-vascular
complications include infective complications.
SECTION 1
• Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obstructive sleep apnoea and an
increased risk of certain malignancies are common co-morbidities that are
associated with T2DM.
• The main aim of management is directed at reducing acute and chronic
diabetes-related complications by targeting control of plasma glucose, BP,
lipids and body weight concurrently.
• Recently, there is evidence that reversal or remission of T2DM may be
possible in some individuals with short duration of disease, following reversal
of insulin resistance through significant and sustained weight loss by either
caloric restriction or bariatric surgery.
1.2 Prevalence and state of T2DM in Malaysia
• The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 20191 (Level II-3) reported a
prevalence of 23.6% for those with abnormal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in
non-diabetic range (FPG 5.6 mmol/L-6.9 mmol/L) at the time of the survey.
This estimates approximately 5 million (5,019,359) adult individuals in
Malaysia with probable prediabetes in 2019 and future risk of diabetes.
• Prevalence of a known or established diagnosis of diabetes during the 2019
NHMS was 9.4%, whilst in 2015 it was 8.3%.2 (level II-3) Hence in 2019, there
were almost 2 million (1,999,450) adult individuals with known diabetes in
Malaysia.
• Prevalence of unknown/undiagnosed diabetes (elevated fasting plasma
glucose of ≥7.0 mmol/L during survey) for adults age ≥18 years; in NHMS
2015 and 2019 were 5.1% and 8.9% respectively.1,2 (Level II-3)
› In 2019, there was an estimated 1,892,515 adult individuals with unknown/
undiagnosed diabetes in Malaysia.
› 42% of those with unknown diabetes are between the age of 18-39 years,
and 40% are between the age 40-59 years.
• Overall diabetes prevalence in adults ≥18 years in NHMS 2015 and 2019 was
13.4% and 18.3% respectively.1,2 (Level II-3) Prevalence for overall diabetes for
adults age 30 years and above was 24.1% in NHMS 2019.
• Prevalence of overall diabetes among the major ethnic groups in the NHMS
2019 showed a similar trend as previous data which was 31.4%, 22.6% and
15.1% among the Indians, Malays and Chinese, respectively.1 (Level II-3)

• According to the latest NHMS 2019,1 >70% of diagnosed T2DM patients seek
care in Ministry of Health (MoH) primary health clinics.
› As part of the MoH’s quality assurance program for diabetes care at
the primary care level, a Diabetes Clinical Audit is conducted annually
on randomly selected T2DM patients, with data collected through the
National Diabetes Registry (NDR).
› Currently there are 886,138 active T2DM patients on follow-up in MoH
health clinics registered in the NDR.3 (Level II-3)
• From the 2019 Diabetes Clinical Audit, involving 181,627 T2DM patients,
the mean HbA1c was 7.9%; with 32.4% achieving HbA1c <6.5%. This was an
improvement from 2013, where the mean HbA1c was 8.1% and only 20.4%
achieved HbA1c <6.5%.3 (Level II-3)
• Among individuals with known diabetes in the NHMS 2019, it was reported
that 25.7% were treated with insulin, 85.6% with OGLDs and 88.0% had
received advice on diet.
• Insulin use was higher overall in MoH clinics and hospitals compared to private
clinics and hospitals.

› 84.0% of individuals with T2DM are either overweight or obese (Body mass
index [BMI] >23.0 kg/m2).
- Mean BMI was 27.8 kg/m2
- Mean waist circumference in males was 95.2 cm (>90 cm in 69.6%) and in

Complications
• In the 2015-2016 annual report of patients admitted with acute coronary
syndrome (National Cardiovascular Disease Database – NCVD-ACS registry),
44.7% of patients were diagnosed to have diabetes. This is the 2nd-most
common CV risk factor; the most prevalent CV risk was hypertension at
63.3%.4 (Level II-3)
• In 2016, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) was the most common cause of end
stage kidney disease (ESKD), accounting for 65% of new patients requiring
dialysis in Malaysia.5 (Level II-3)

INTRODUCTION: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS, THE DISEASE
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
2.1 Objective and strategies
Objective
• To diagnose prediabetes and T2DM among the general population
specifically the high-risk individuals, whilst ensuring prompt and appropriate
intervention.
Strategies
• Screening the general population to identify high-risk individuals.
• Screening of specific high-risk populations e.g. those with history of
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
2.2 Who should be screened
• Symptomatic individuals
› Any individual who has symptoms suggestive of T2DM (fatigue, lethargy,
polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss, pruritus vulvae,
balanitis) should be investigated to confirm diagnosis of T2DM.6 (Level III)
SECTION 2
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Risk-based screening for pre-diabetes and/or T2DM in adults should
be performed in individuals >30 years of age and repeated annually.
• In symptomatic individuals, 1 abnormal result (either plasma glucose/
HbA1c) is diagnostic while in asymptomatic individuals, 2 abnormal
test results from the same sample (e.g. plasma glucose + HbA1c) or
from 2 separate test samples are accepted for diagnosis.
• Recommendations for criteria-based screening of adolescents who
are overweight and have additional risk factors for T2DM (NEW).
SECTION 2
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
• Asymptomatic individuals
› From our National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) data,1 (Level II-3)
48.6% of individuals with diabetes were undiagnosed at time of screening.
Recognising that up to 50% of individuals with diabetes are asymptomatic
makes the case for screening when specific risk factors are present.
Table 2-1: Criteria for testing for T2DM or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults
A. Women with history of GDM
C. All individuals with prediabetes (HbA1c ≥5.7%-6.2% [39 mmol/mol44 mmol/mol], IGT, or IGF) should be tested yearly.
B. Adults who are overweight or obese (Body mass index [BMI] ≥23 kg/m2
or waist circumference ≥80 cm for women and ≥90 cm for men) with
ANY of the following*:
• History of CVD
• 1° relatives with T2DM
• Hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)
• HDL-C <0.9 mmol/L or TG >2.8 mmol/L
• Women who have delivered a baby weighing ≥4 kg
• Those who were born from mothers with GDM
• Other endocrine conditions associated with insulin resistance e.g.
› PCOS
› Cushing’s syndrome
› Acromegaly
› Phaeochromocytoma
› Presence of acanthosis nigricans
• Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle
• Those receiving long-term treatment with any of the following:
› corticosteroids
› anti-retroviral therapy
› atypical anti-psychotic drugs
› thiazide diuretics
› β-adrenergic blockers
› 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase
inhibitors [statins]
Note: In those without the above risk factors, testing should begin at the age of 30 years.
If tests are normal, screening should be performed annually.7 (Level III)
Adapted from the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes 2020.6 (Level III)
Screening should be performed in adolescents* who are overweight
(85th percentile) or obese (95th percentile), and who have one or more
additional risk factors such as:
• maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child’s gestation
• family history of T2DM in a 1° relative
• recurrent abscess and/or pruritus genitalia
• signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin
resistance (dyslipidaemia, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome,
acanthosis nigricans or small for gestational age birth weight)
If tests are normal, repeat screening at a minimum of 3-year intervals,
or more frequently if BMI is increasing.
*After the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier.
Adapted from the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes 2020.6 (Level III)
Table 2-2: Criteria for testing for T2DM in adolescents
2.3 Screening test
Capillary plasma glucose
• In circumstances where facilities for venous plasma glucose measurements are
not readily available, preliminary screening can be performed by measuring
capillary plasma glucose using standard glucometers.
› This testing can be done irrespective of timing of prior meals.
› If the random capillary plasma glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L or fasting ≥5.6 mmol/L,
a confirmatory test needs to be performed by one of the following methods
- fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
- oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
- HbA1c
• Screening should be done annually in those listed in Tables 2-1 and 2-2.
2.4 Diagnostic tests
• Fasting plasma glucose
› This should be performed following a minimum of an 8-hour overnight fast.
› Once blood is taken, the sample should not be left standing as the
concentration of glucose decreases due to glycolysis, which degrades
glucose at a rate of 5% to 7% per hour.8 (Level II-2)
SECTION 2
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
SECTION 2
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
› This glycolysis can be prevented by using sample tubes containing
glycolysis inhibitors such as citrate buffer.
› Patient is considered to have prediabetes/IFG if the FPG is between 6.16.9 mmol/L and diabetes if the FPG is ≥7.0 mmol/L (Refer Table 2-3 and,
Figures 2-1 and 2-2).
Table 2-3: Diagnostic value for T2DM based on venous plasma glucose

Venous plasma glucose

≥11.1 mmol/L
In symptomatic individuals, one abnormal glucose value is diagnostic. In asymptomatic individuals, 2
abnormal test results (plasma glucose and HbA1c) from the same sample or from 2 separate test samples
are required for diagnosis.
• Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
› OGTT is done in the fasting state using 75 g of glucose.
› Patient should rest throughout the test and only allowed to drink plain
water.
› A 2-hour plasma glucose of ≥11.1 mmol/L confirms the diagnosis of
diabetes.
› Patient is considered to have IGT or prediabetes if the 2-hour plasma
glucose level is between 7.8-11.0 mmol/L (Refer Table 2-4 and, Figures 2-1
and 2-2).

IFG: impaired fasting glucose; IGT: impaired glucose tolerance; T2DM: type 2 diabetes mellitus. In
adolescents, the glucose load in OGTT is based on body weight (1.75 g/kg body weight, maximum of 75 g).
• HbA1c
› HbA1c reflects the average plasma glucose level over the preceding 3
months.9 (Level I)
› Although OGTT used to be the “gold standard” for diagnosing T2DM, it is
known to be poorly reproducible and is cumbersome to perform.10 (Level II-2)
› Standardised HbA1c assay has been shown to have the least variability
(0.3%-0.4%) compared to fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose levels, 12%
and 20% respectively.11 (Level II-2)
› Using HbA1c to diagnose is convenient as it does not require the individual
to fast or consume oral glucose, and it can be performed at any time of the
day.10-15 (Level II-2)
› Based on the Metabolic Syndrome Study of Malaysia (MSSM) 2009,
involving 4,400 adults, a HbA1c level of 6.3% has a positive predictive value
of 58% and negative predictive value of 84%.
- HbA1c at this level was found to give the maximal acceptable sum of
specificity and sensitivity of 97% and 42.5%, respectively in diagnosing
T2DM for all three major ethnic groups in this country.
› Diagnosing T2DM based on HbA1c of 6.5% however leads to a lower
unacceptable sensitivity of 36.7%.
- These data are based on correlation between HbA1c levels and 75-gram
OGTT results where the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve
obtained was 0.85, consistent with other similar studies.
› Individuals with HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.2% will be deemed as having
prediabetes.
- At HbA1c level of 5.7%, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing
prediabetes were 78% and 79% respectively.
- If HbA1c is used for the diagnosis of prediabetes, it is best that the test
is followed by an OGTT to classify individuals into either IFG, IGT or
combination of both.16,17 (Level II-2)
- This has prognostic significance in terms of the risk of developing CVD
and conversion to frank T2DM.

A repeat HbA1c should be done 4 weeks after the first positive test for asymptomatic patients (if an
accompanying FPG or RPG is indeterminate). For symptomatic patients, a single positive test is sufficient.
FPG: fasting plasma glucose; RPG: random plasma glucose
› There are situations where the HbA1c value may not reflect the true level of
glycaemia (glycation gap) due to various causes (Refer to Section 3.8.1).18,19
- Depending on the method used for measuring HbA1c, some may give
inaccurate results when the patients have a haemoglobin variant.20,21 (Level III)
» In patients suspected of having haemoglobinopathies, other screening
tests for e.g. another HbA1c methodology should be used (such as the
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program [NGSP] available
online at http://www.ngsp.org/interf.asp).
SECTION 2
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
› HbA1c is not appropriate for the diagnosis of diabetes in:
- adolescents (<18 years old) since the diagnostic cut-off point was derived
in those >18 years,
- patients taking medication that may cause rapid glucose rise e.g.
steroids, antipsychotics,
- patients taking iron supplements (may falsely lower HbA1c levels),
- patients with acute pancreatic damage, including pancreatic surgery,
- presence of genetic, haematologic and illness-related factors that
influence HbA1c and its measurement (e.g. haemoglobinopathies,
rheumatoid arthritis, chronic liver disease, post-splenectomy),
- patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 4 or 5 and those on
erythropoietin injections; and
- anaemia due to iron, vitamin B12 or erythropoietin deficiencies.
› HbA1c reporting and the new SI units
- Glycaemic control in patients with diabetes is assessed using HbA1c.
» The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) clearly demonstrated
the correlation of an increasing HbA1c with the increased risk of
complications.22-24 (Level I)
» Hence, for HbA1c to be useful, it is important that the HbA1c assays are
standardised.
» Several international and national standardisation programs have
evolved over the years to enable the conformity of HbA1c results from
different laboratories to those reported in the DCCT trial.
- In 1994, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory
Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on Standardisation of HbA1c developed
a global HbA1c reference system with a much improved intra-assay and
inter-assay coefficients of variation of <2.5%.25 (Level II-1)
- For the purpose of diagnosis, the HbA1c test should be performed using
the method that is certified by the NGSP-HbA1c units (%) and standardised
according to the assays employed in the DCCT study. Recommendations
have been made on the reporting of HbA1c results as IFCC-HbA1c values in
SI units (mmol HbA1c/mol Hb) [Refer to Section 3.8.1 and Table 3-21]
SECTION 2

SECTION 2
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
2.5 Cardiovascular risk estimation
• It is well established that patients with prediabetes and T2DM have a 2-3-fold
increased risk of developing CVD.
• 60% of patients with T2DM will eventually die from CV complications.
• As such, it is prudent that the CV risk profiles be determined at diagnosis of
prediabetes and T2DM as well as during each clinic visit.
• Those who are in the high-risk group should have their T2DM and other CVD
risk factors treated aggressively with closer monitoring.
Recommendations: Screening and diagnosis
1. Screening for diabetes using FPG or HbA1c should be
performed annually in those with risk factors and
those ≥30 years.
Grade C
2. Diagnosis of T2DM and prediabetes can be made
using FPG or RPG, OGTT or HbA1c.
Grade B
3. In individuals with a FPG of ≥6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L or
HbA1c between 5.7% to 6.2% further testing with
a 75-g OGTT should be considered in order to
categorise them into individuals with IGT or T2DM.
Grade C
4. Patients diagnosed with T2DM should have other
CVD risk factors treated aggressively with close
monitoring.

SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2
DIABETES MELLITUS
3.1 Initial assessment
• At diagnosis of T2DM:
› a detailed history which focuses on a few key issues which will affect
treatment decision should be undertaken apart from assessing for
symptoms and presentation of diabetes (Refer Table 3-1).26
› full physical examination (including fundoscopy and monofilament test)
and baseline investigations should be performed to assess for presence of
ASCVD risk factors and complications of diabetes.
• Management is based on results of the above.26
• Diabetes management involves lifestyle modification, medications and
patient education to encourage self-care and empowerment.27,28 (Level I) 29,30 (Level III)
SECTION 3
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Importance of categorizing patients at initial visit, in particular with
regard to presence of co-morbidities; i.e. CV, renal complications,
quality of life assessments, as it will help in deciding management
plans.

• Achievement of appropriate glycaemic levels with lifestyle management
including weight reduction (where appropriate) and maintain durability
of glycaemic control
• Reduction of other CV risk factors
• Identification and treatment of chronic complications
• Optimise quality of life
• Most of the microvascular complications of T2DM are related to the degree
and the length of exposure to hyperglycaemia.23,34 (Level I)
• The legacy effect/metabolic memory of early glycaemic control is well
established in reducing both micro- and macrovascular complications.23,34 (Level I)
This should be emphasized in all patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.
• Multiple risk factor reduction (the ABC’s for T2DM) has been shown to reduce
long term complications and mortality sustained beyond the intervention
phase.35,36 (Level I) These are:
› A – HbA1c (glycaemic control)
› B – BP control
› C – Cholesterol (lipid control)
3.2 Diabetes education
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Diabetes self-management education and support continues to be
an essential part of ensuring patient motivation and adherence.
• Local primary healthcare diabetes education programs run as part
of a chronic care model has been shown to be effective in improving
glycaemic targets.
• Structured diabetes education programs that are patient-centred
have been shown to improve glycaemic control; use of newer
technology, e.g. digital web-based apps/short-messaging system
(SMS) or phone calls further encourage patient participation.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Diabetes education is effective in improving clinical outcomes and QoL37-39
(Level I) and their family members and carers should be involved as well.
• Diabetes education should be offered in a timely manner and suggested at
four critical times for self-management education and support:6,40-42 (Level III)
› at diagnosis,
› annually,
› when complicating factors arise; and
› when transitions in care occur.
• Any member of the diabetes health team who has adequate training can
deliver Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) with the physician as
the head of team and coordinator.42 (Level III)
• The more the duration (frequency and length) of contact time between the
educator and the patient, the better the HbA1c reduction.37 (Level II-1)
• Provision of individual empowerment and self-management education
strategies should be considered to enhance self-efficacy, self-care, selfmanagement and motivation.6,40,42-45 (Level III)
• Structured diabetes education and support should be patient-centred, may
be given in group or individual setting and/or using technology, for the
purpose of improving self-management and self-empowerment.6 (Level III)
• Diabetes Self-Management Support (SMS)6,40,42,45 (Level III) such as coaching
via monthly telephone calls improves glycaemic control and compliance
to complication screening. Interventions that encourage patient’s active
participation such as patient empowering group education and automatic
telephone management program has been found to result in better
outcomes.46,47 (Level I) 48 (Level II-1)
• Diabetes Education as part of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) has been shown
to improve HbA1C in primary healthcare clinic settings in Malaysia.
› Incorporating diabetes education in the form of a structured and scheduled
diabetes education program by a dedicated team, in a pragmatic, clusterrandomised, parallel, matched pair, controlled trial achieved significant
HbA1C of <6.5%, adjusted OR 2.16 (95% CI 1.34,3.50), p<0.002.49 (Level II-2)
• The design of a CCM’s delivery system that incorporates diabetes education
was reported to have the largest impact in improving patient outcomes (mean
reduction of HbA1c by 0.46% (95% CI 0.38, 0.54)50 (Level I) 51,52 (Level II) followed by

› Working with healthcare providers with different skills and specialities
allows the patient to gain in-depth knowledge and understanding of their
T2DM.60 (Level III)
› It also ensures that:
- the patient’s needs are addressed,
- it avoids therapeutic inertia; and
- it prioritises timely and appropriate intensification of lifestyle and/or
pharmacologic therapy.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• For the patient to accept responsibility for self-care they must understand
the disease, its effect on health and the necessity of management. Good
communication between team members is important to ensure consistent
advice and avoid confusing the patient.60 (Level III)
• Teams working together help patients to:6,60 (Level III) 61 (Level II-2)
› get appropriate medical tests and examinations (e.g. plasma glucose level,
BP, lipid level, weight, eye and foot examinations),
› make healthy behaviour and lifestyle choices (e.g. improved diet, increased
physical activity, cessation of smoking),
› use medications to manage and control risk factors (e.g. plasma glucose,
BP, lipids),
› self-manage and adhere to treatment,
› prevent diabetes-related complications,
› improve QoL.
• Evidence62-64 (Level II-2) shows that these interventions are able to:
› improve patients’ glucose, BP and lipid levels,
› increase proportion of patients who reach target plasma glucose, BP and
lipid levels,
› improve patients’ diabetes related QoL and general physical, and mental
health.
The following professionals are important team members in the multidisciplinary management of T2DM.
Diabetes educator
• Diabetes nurse educators cover all topics related to T2DM management
including knowledge, skills and health beliefs/perceptions regarding:
› healthy eating,
› physical activity,
› self-monitoring,
› medication usage,
› goal setting,
› problem solving,
› risk reduction practices such as foot care, smoking cessation and keeping
follow-up medical appointments; and
› healthy coping to assess presence of diabetes distress, anxiety and
depression.
• They often have more time than doctors to allocate to each patient, which
permits them to emphasize on specific needs.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Dietitian
• Referral to a dietitian is required to ensure detailed dietary education.
• Dietitians help patients develop healthful eating plans, appropriate to
individual needs and circumstances.
• In addition, they can help identify and address problems such as disordered
meal patterns, timing of meals, eating disorders and other physiological and
psychosocial problems.
• These issues may not be readily identified during doctor office visits.
• The other team members also need to understand the principles of dietary
advice to assist in reinforcing dietary recommendations (Refer Section 3.5.1).
Registered Nurses and Assistant Medical Officers
• Registered nurses and assistant medical officers can provide assessments
before the doctor sees the patient, which allows for a better focus on any
identified problems.
• Teaching medication administration is another important area that can be
delegated to them.
• In addition, these healthcare providers can make follow-up phone calls to
assess medication administration/adherence, medication tolerability, and
other related diabetes management issues.
Physician/Endocrinologist/Diabetologist
• The advice of a specialist physician may be valuable for patients with
complicated problems related to T2DM.
• These patients may present with poorly controlled diabetes despite the
standard care and the onset of various complications.
• A shared care approach by the primary care practitioner and specialist will
provide the best combination of expertise and continuity of care to the
patient.
Pharmacist
• Pharmacists play a role in ensuring adherence and giving information about
medications’ mode of action and side effects.
• They may undertake special tasks of training the patients to administer and
adjust insulin dosing.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Ophthalmologist/Optometrist
• Referral to an ophthalmologist/optometrist is required for further assessment
and management of retinopathy and other eye problems (Refer Section 5.1).
Oral health professional
• Dental and periodontal problems are common in patients with T2DM with a
long established bi-directional influence reported.65 (Level II-2)
• People with T2DM tend to have poorer oral hygiene and more severe gingival
and periodontal diseases6 (Level III) that:
› may contribute to worsening of glycaemic control;61 (Level III) 66 (Level II-2) and
› is a major cause of tooth loss, nutritional compromise, altered speech, low
self-esteem and a poorer overall quality of life.67 (Level II-2)
• Therefore, referrals should be done routinely for oral healthcare (Refer
Section 5.9).68,69 (Level II-2) 70 (Level III)
Recommendations: Assessment, aims of treatment and
education
1. All newly diagnosed T2DM need to be reviewed by a
medical doctor and screening for other cardiovascular

SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) with weight loss can prevent T2DM
• Structured
lifestyle
intervention
incorporating
partial
diet
replacement can improve HbA1c, lipid profile and BP.
• A total diet replacement with weight loss of up to 15% body weight
(approximately 15 kg) can lead to diabetes remission.
• A healthful eating pattern with low glycaemic index (GI) diet may
be relevant in the Malaysian context because excessive rise in postprandial glycaemia is frequently observed.
3.5 Lifestyle modification
3.5.1 Medical nutrition therapy (MNT)
Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is important in preventing diabetes, managing
existing diabetes, and delaying complications. Proper diet is crucial at all stages
of management of diabetes including those on medication. The need for
medical therapy should not be interpreted as a failure of lifestyle management
but as an adjunct to it.
General recommendations
• Nutrition care by a dietitian should be provided under the following
conditions: at diagnosis, sub-optimal metabolic and/or weight control, at
initiation of insulin therapy, development of other co-morbidities such as
hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and DKD.73 (Level I)
• Individualised dietary counselling by a dietitian is effective to lower HbA1c
up to 2.0% in 6 months, reduce weight, CV risk, lower medication use and
improve quality of life (QoL).6,74,75 (Level I)
• The goals of MNT are to:
› improve HbA1c, BP, cholesterol levels, achieve and maintain body weight
goals,
› promote healthful eating patterns in appropriate portion sizes and limiting
food choices only when supported by scientific evidence,
› provide nutrition needs based on cultural preferences, health literacy and
numeracy, willingness and ability to make behavioural changes.73 (Level III)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Specific recommendations
A. Prevention of T2DM
The following diet and lifestyle changes are recommended for individuals with
BMI >23 kg/m2 (overweight) or >27.5 kg/m2 (obese) who have prediabetes or
are at risk for diabetes:
• Weight loss of ≥7%-10% of initial body weight within 6 months has been
proven to be effective for diabetes prevention.(Level I) This can be achieved by:
› reducing calorie intake of 500-1000 kcal/day from baseline76 (Level I) E.g. aim
for intake of 1200-1500 kcal/day for women and 1500-1800 kcal/day for
men,77 (Level I)
› including ≥150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical
activity e.g. 30 minutes of brisk walking for 5 days or more per week,78 (Level I)
› a combination of reduced calorie diet, physical activity and behaviour
modification can provide greater initial weight loss,78 (Level I)
› using meal replacement plans (MRPs) as part of a structured meal plan for
weight loss and weight maintenance.79 (Level I)
• A healthy dietary plan that includes:
› a high fibre diet (20-30 g fibre/day) by choosing plant-based foods such
as vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grain cereals80,81 (Level II-2) has been
shown to reduce risk of T2DM.
- In several prospective cohort studies, a higher intake of vegetables,
fruits, substituting white rice with brown rice and wholemeal bread may
reduce risk of T2DM.82-84 (Level II-2)
- Whole grains should form 50% of the total grain intake as recommended
by the Malaysian Dietary Guidelines, 2020.85 (Level III)
› avoiding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB).86 (Level II-2)
Replacing SSB with plain water has been shown to reduce risk of T2DM in a
cohort study.87 (Level II-2)
› a low fat intake to reduce body weight and improve glucose levels has
been shown to be effective in several diabetes prevention RCTs.88 (Level I)
› limiting intake of saturated fat, such as limiting red meat and processed
meat consumption, has been shown to reduce risk of T2DM.89 (Level II-2)
› following the Malaysian Healthy Plate Model may help increase consumption
of vegetables and fruits and control portion size of meals.90 (Level III) (Refer
Appendix 1)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
B. Management of T2DM
• Weight management
› Individuals who are overweight (BMI >23.0 kg/m2 - <27.5 kg/m2) and obese
(>27.5 kg/m2) and not achieving glycaemic control should restrict their
caloric intake with the goal of reducing body weight by at least 5%-10%.(Level I)
› Structured lifestyle intervention and:
- MRP have been shown to be effective in lowering HbA1c, lipid profile and
BP.91-94 (Level I)
- total diet replacement (TRP) (≤800 kcal/day) inducing weight loss up
to 15% (approximately 15 kg) from baseline has been shown to lead to
diabetes remission in T2DM patients.95 (Level I)
• Overall macronutrient distribution
› There is no ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate (CHO), protein
and fat for people with T2DM. A balanced diet consisting of 45%-60% of
energy from CHO, 15%-20% energy from protein and 25%-35% energy
from fat is encouraged.96 (Level III)
› These recommendations must be individualised based on weight, glycaemic
and other metabolic goals, cultural preferences and individual lifestyle.
i.
Amount and type of carbohydrates (CHO)
- Monitoring the total amount of CHO intake remains a key strategy in
achieving glycaemic control.97 (Level I)
» Total amount of CHO intake can be monitored using grams,
exchange list, household or hand measures as long as it is practical
for patients to comprehend and follow.
» It is prudent to individualise the distribution of the total CHO
exchanges allowed in a day into meals according to the patient’s
lifestyle. The current practical guide98 (Level III) is provided below:

SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
» CHO intake must be kept consistent on a day-to-day basis if the
patient is on diet therapy alone, OGLDs or fixed insulin regime.99 (Level I)
» If the patient is adjusting their meal-time insulin doses or on insulin
pump (i.e. flexible insulin dosing) consistency is not required. Insulin
doses should be adjusted to match CHO intake. Self-monitoring
of blood glucose (SMBG) is essential to adjust the insulin dose
according to CHO intake.100 (Level I)
- A minimum of 130 g/day CHO should be provided to ensure adequate
intake of fibre, vitamins, and minerals, as well as to prevent ketosis
and to provide dietary palatability.101 (Level I)
- CHO intake should emphasize nutrient-dense CHO sources that are
high in fibre, including vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, as
well as dairy products.96 (Level II-2)
- Sucrose (e.g. table sugar) intake must be counted as part of the total
CHO intake.102 (Level III) Excess sucrose intake contributes to calories and
may cause weight gain.103 (Level II-2)
- Sugar substitutes (high-intensity sweeteners, artificial sweeteners,
nonnutritive sweeteners, and low-calorie sweeteners) do not impact
glycaemic level.103,104 (Level II-2)
» These include saccharin, neotame, acesulfame-K, aspartame,
sucralose, advantame, stevia, and luo han guo (or monk fruit).
» Replacing added sugars with sugar substitutes will decrease daily
intake of CHO and calories. Intake should not exceed acceptable
daily intake (ADI) levels.
» There is insufficient evidence that such sugar substitutes cause
harm or increase the risk of diabetes.
ii. Glycaemic index
- GI is a measure to classify types of CHO based on their effect on
plasma glucose level. It is a ranking system that indicates how quickly
CHO foods raise plasma glucose level. Foods with high GI value raise
plasma glucose more than food with medium or low GI.
- Substituting high GI foods with lower GI foods during meals reduces
post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG), and modestly improves HbA1c by
(-)0.14%-(-)0.5%,105-108 (Level I) provided the energy and total CHO intake
are not excessive. A lower GI diet may be relevant in the Malaysian
context because excessive rise in PPG is frequently observed.
- Two recent systematic reviews regarding GI showed that studies
which are longer than 12 weeks report no significant influence of
glycaemic index or glycaemic load independent of weight loss on
HbA1c; however, mixed results have been reported for fasting glucose
levels and endogenous insulin levels.96,105,109 (Level I) Further studies are
needed to verify the benefits of low GI diets.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
iii. Low CHO diets
- Reducing overall CHO intake for individuals with diabetes is not
beneficial in the long-term. Benefits of lowering HbA1c, triglycerides,
promoting weight loss and lowering BP is only demonstrated in shortterm studies of <6 months duration with a high risk of bias.110 (Level I)
» Changes in weight, lipid profiles and BP did not differ significantly
between groups eating <40% energy (en) CHO vs. >40% en CHO.
» Long-term adherence and sustainability to a low-CHO eating plan
is generally poor. In addition, there is variability in the definition of
low CHO diet e.g. American Dietetic Association definition:
º very low: <26% en CHO;
º low: 26%-45% en CHO and
º high CHO: >45% en CHO.
The variability in definitions make studies’ results difficult to
interpret.
» A healthful eating pattern which is low in saturated fat, low in
sodium, high in fruits and vegetables and wholegrain cereals will
still need to be recommended when following a low-CHO diet.
» A very low CHO diet such as ketogenic diet (<50 g CHO) are
discouraged due to challenges with long-term sustainability and
nutrient imbalances of high fat content, excessive fibre intake and
micronutrient deficiencies.111 (Level III) It is also unsafe for specific groups
such as those with renal disease or disordered eating behaviours,
and those taking SGLT2-i due to potential risk of ketoacidosis.112,113
(Level III)
» Meal plans that meet individualised caloric goals with a
macronutrient distribution that is consistent with usual eating
pattern is recommended for long-term achievement of glycaemia,
lipids and weight goals.113 (Level III)
iv. Protein
- In patients with normal renal function, usual protein intake of 15%-
20% energy has minimal effect on glycaemic control.114 (Level I)
- It is recommended to include lean sources of protein such as lean
meat, fish, chicken/poultry without skin and soy protein.114 (Level I)
- In patients with impaired renal function, protein restriction of 0.81.0 g/kg body weight/day may be recommended.115 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
v. Fats
- Patients with T2DM should limit total fat (25%-35% energy intake),
saturated fats (<7% energy intake) and minimise trans-fat (<1%
energy intake) for prevention and treatment of CVD.75,116 (Level I)
- A healthy diet incorporating oats, nuts and legumes, green leafy
vegetables and soy protein may be beneficial for cardiovascular
health.116 (Level I)
• Sodium
› In normotensive and hypertensive patients, a reduced sodium intake
(<2,000 mg sodium/day or 5 g of salt a day or 1 teaspoon) with a diet high
in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products lowers BP.117 (Level I)
• Dietary supplements and diabetes-specific formulas
› Patients with T2DM have the same vitamin and mineral requirements as
the general population.
- There is no clear evidence of benefit from the use of antioxidant
vitamins A, C, E, D, selenium, chromium, herbs and omega-3 fatty acids in
improving glycaemic control.118-120 (Level I)
› Diabetes-specific oral nutritional supplement (ONS) beverages or formulas
may be prescribed for malnourished patients who are unable or have not
been eating well for prolonged periods of time or these beverages are
used as MRP for weight loss.75 (Level III)
• Intermittent fasting (IF) and time-restricted diets (TRE)
› In IF, the eating period is restricted, with an unintentional reduction in
calorie intake. TRE involves consuming all calories within a consistent 8 h-
12 h daily timespan.
› Due to limited evidence and small-scale studies, the effectiveness of IF and
TRE in diabetes management is uncertain and not significantly different
from conventional calorie-restricted diets.121-124 (Level I)
Refer to Appendices 2-4 on CHO foods, food exchange list and Glycaemic Index
list.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Recommendations: Medical nutrition therapy
1. Medical nutritional therapy is the mainstay of
prevention and treatment of T2DM. Proper diet
is crucial at all stages of management of diabetes
including those on medication.
Grade A
2. For obese and overweight patients, weight loss of up
to 10% of initial body weight over a 6-month period is
recommended to prevent T2DM.
Grade A
3. A healthful eating pattern i.e. low in saturated fat,
low in sodium, high in fruits, vegetables, wholegrain
cereals and legumes is recommended for prediabetes
and T2DM patients.
Grade B
4. Meal plans that meet individualised caloric goals with
a macronutrient distribution that is consistent with a
healthful eating pattern is recommended for long-term
achievement of glycaemia, lipids and weight goals.
Grade B
3.5.2 Physical activity
• Increased physical activity can improve glycaemic control, assist with weight
maintenance, and reduce the risk of CVD.55
• Combining physical activity with dietary intervention results in greater HbA1c
reduction.
• Mild to moderate exercise is generally safe but before beginning a program
of vigorous physical activity, people with T2DM should be assessed for
complications that may preclude vigorous exercise (CVD, retinopathy,
neuropathy and foot injury).125 (Level II-2)
• In older patients, previously sedentary, long-standing T2DM, patients with
multiple risk factors, and patients with previous evidence of atherosclerotic
disease should be considered for pre-exercise assessment (Refer Appendix
5). (Level III)
• The patient should choose an activity that he or she is likely to maintain.
Walking is accessible to most patients in terms of time and financial
expenditure.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Individuals should exercise at least 3 times/week, preferably most days of the
week and with no more than 48-72 hours without physical activity,6 (Level III) as the
insulin-sensitising effect of an acute bout of exercise does not last beyond this
duration126 (Level II-2) 127,128 (Level III) while, the improved insulin sensitivity of regular
exercise training persists for up to 5 days after inactivity.126 (Level II-2) 129 (Level I)
• For patients with T2DM, supervised exercise programs have been particularly
effective in improving glycaemic control, reducing the need for OGLDs and
insulin, and producing modest but sustained weight loss.130,131 (Level I)
• Both aerobic and resistance exercise are beneficial for patients with diabetes,
and it is optimal to do both types of exercise.
• The duration of exercise should be at least 150 minutes/week of moderate
intensity or at least 75 minutes/week of vigorous aerobic physical
activity125,132,133 (Level I) and at least 2 sessions per week of resistance exercise130
(Level I) (Refer Appendix 6 for exercise examples).
• Greater reduction in HbA1c
133 (Level I) and CV complications134 (Level II-2) can be
achieved with higher duration of exercise. It is therefore recommended
to aim for a higher duration of exercise (300 minutes/week of moderate
intensity) for those who are able to do so.
› 0.9% mean HbA1c reduction with >150 minutes/week vs. 0.4% reduction
with moderate intensity exercise <150 minutes/week.
› 20% reduction in CHD risk with 300 minutes/week vs. 14% risk reduction
with moderate-intensity exercise 150 minutes/week.
• Duration of exercise should be increased to ≥60 minutes per day/
approximately 450 minutes per week in overweight or obese patients to
facilitate weight reduction.135 (Level III)
• Any increase in daily energy expenditure is beneficial (Refer Appendix 6 for
metabolic equivalent targets). (Level III)
There are many Malaysians with T2DM on basal bolus insulin regimen. There is
limited data/evidence to guide recommendations for adjustment of glucoselowering therapy in T2DM during exercise. The risk of hypoglycaemia with
exercise in T2DM is much lower compared to patients with type 1 diabetes
mellitus (T1DM).136 (Level II-2)
• However, risk of hypoglycaemia with exercise should still be considered in
T2DM patients on SU therapy or insulin, as the hypoglycaemic effects of SU is
increased with exercise137 (Level II-2) and a small number of individuals on insulin
may develop hypoglycaemia with exercise.138 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Consideration of glycaemic pattern as part of individualised assessment is
advised and treatment changes will depend on duration and intensity of the
exercise, existing glucose-lowering therapy, any planned reduction in calorie
intake as well as the prevailing glycaemic control and pre-existing rate of
hypoglycaemia.138 (Level I) 139,140 (Level II-1) 136 (Level II-2)
› Patients with suboptimal diabetes control (HbA1c >7%) and known postprandial hyperglycaemia without documented hypoglycaemia may not
require any insulin dose reduction when commencing moderate-intensity
exercise with usual diabetic diet.140 (Level II-1) 136 (Level II-2)
› When combining initiation of exercise with reduction in calorie intake for
weight-loss, there is a greater risk of hypoglycaemia. Reduction in glucoselowering therapy with insulin, SUs and glinides should be considered
depending on the baseline glucose profile. In T2DM patients with preexisting symptomatic hypoglycaemia, reduction of such treatments by
50% or more should be considered prior to initiation of combination
exercise and diet intervention.138 (Level I)
› When there is concern about possibility of hypoglycaemia (patients with
near-normal postprandial plasma glucose readings), reduction of bolus
insulin of up to 50% (depending on exercise intensity) without adverse
hyperglycaemia and exercise can also be performed in the postprandial
state.139 (Level II-1)
› Exercise performed in the fasting state may have greater impact on
subsequent postprandial glucose reduction compared to exercise
performed in the postprandial state.141 (Level II-2)
› Elevated fasting plasma glucose in T2DM patients with dawn phenomenon,
may be reduced by performing early morning exercise in the fasting state
(prebreakfast).142 (Level II-2)
› There is inadequate evidence to guide the need for glucose monitoring
during exercise in T2DM patients. It is suggested that patients at high
risk of hypoglycaemia (e.g. well-controlled diabetes on insulin therapy
with calorie reduction) engaging in prolonged exercise (more than 3045 minutes) should perform plasma glucose monitoring. This is based on
experience with T1DM patients. (Level III)
• Hyperglycaemia is not a contraindication for exercise in people with T2DM
provided they feel well (no symptoms of dehydration such as excessive
thirst, nausea or fatigue).143 (Level III)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Recommendations: Physical activity
1. In older patients, previously sedentary, long-standing
T2DM, patients with multiple risk factors, and patients
with previous evidence of atherosclerotic disease
should be considered for pre-exercise assessment.
Grade C
2. The duration of exercise should be at least 150
minutes/week of moderate-intensity and/or at least
75 minutes/week of vigorous aerobic and at least two
sessions per week of resistance exercise.
Grade A
3. Higher duration of exercise (300 minutes/week of
moderate-intensity) is advisable for greater benefit in
glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction.
Grade B
4. Glucose lowering drugs may need adjustment if
exercise is planned. Insulin-treated patients engaging
in moderate/high-intensity exercise may require
counselling and modification of insulin doses.
Grade C
3.5.3 Tobacco cessation
• Smoking of tobacco and tobacco products (cigarette, electronic cigarette/
vape, shisha, pipe, cigar etc.) can lead to various complications of chronic
non-communicable diseases (NCD) such as coronary heart disease, cancers,
and chronic lung disease. It is the main cause of death worldwide whereby 8
million people die every year as a consequence of this habit.957
• Hence, the decision to integrate smoking treatment with NCDs is important
to reduce the prevalence of NCDs and their complications. This decision
was made during the World Health Organization Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) Steering Committee Meeting in December
2019 chaired by the Honourable Health Minister of Malaysia.
• The treatment for smoking should be initiated by the treating doctor based
on the assessment and treatment of tobacco use disorder as in Appendix 12–
Assessment and Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder. More details on this can

SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
3.6.1 Oral glucose lowering drugs (OGLDs)
Biguanides (Metformin)
• Metformin lowers blood glucose especially fasting plasma glucose by
decreasing hepatic glucose production. It does not stimulate insulin secretion
and as monotherapy, is usually not accompanied by hypoglycaemia.
• Metformin reduces HbA1c by up to 1.5%.144 (Level I)
• Use in combination with other OGLDs has a synergistic effect to further
reduce plasma glucose and may reduce insulin requirement.145 (Level I)
• Most common adverse effects are nausea, anorexia and diarrhoea.
› These are minimised if metformin is taken together with/or after meals.
› To reduce GI side effects, it is best to start with a single daily dose, followed
by weekly titration.
› Extended release formulation also reduces these side effects.144 (Level I)
• Vitamin B12 deficiency is a recognised uncommon long-term complication.146 (Level II-2)
• Lactic acidosis is rare (<1 case per 100,000 treated patients) and usually
associated with renal impairment.147 (Level I)
• Metformin is weight neutral or may result in mild weight loss of up to 1.1 kg.148 (Level II-1)
• Current evidence shows that T2DM individuals who smoke have a higher risk
for cardiovascular morbidity and premature mortality and worse glycaemic
control compared with T2DM non-smokers.953 (Level II-3)
3.6 Medications
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have confirmed CV
benefits beyond glucose lowering in 2 classes of GLDs i.e. GLP1-RA
and SGLT2-i. As a result, a new paradigm shift in choice of drug
therapy has emerged.
• Achieving HbA1c targets remains an important goal that may require
combining drugs that target the multiple pathophysiological defects.
• Recent evidence supports the use of early combination therapy for
durability of glycaemic control.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Doses beyond 2000 mg OD do not confer any further glycaemic benefit and
significantly increase GI side effects.145 (Level I)
• Low dose metformin can be safely prescribed to lactating mothers.149 (Level II-1) 150 (Level II-2)

Sulphonylureas (SU)
• SUs reduce plasma glucose by increasing insulin secretion with an average
HbA1c reduction of 0.46%-1.62%.151 (Level I)
• The major adverse effect is hypoglycaemia.151,152 (Level I) The risk is higher in
renal impairment, liver cirrhosis and the elderly.153 (Level II-2)
• Weight gain in the range of 1.31 kg-3.32 kg is common.151,152 (Level I)
• Among the second generation SUs, gliclazide, glipizide and glimepiride are
preferred over other SUs as they cause less hypoglycaemia and less weight
gain.154,155 (Level I) 156 (Level III)
• Glibenclamide has been shown to be associated with significant risk of
hypoglycaemia and WHO recommends against its use in those above 60
years of age.157 (Level III)
• SUs are highly protein bound. Administration of drugs that can displace them
(e.g. NSAIDs, anti-thyroid drugs, sulpha drugs, anticoagulants and α-blockers)
can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.158 (Level III)
• SUs should be taken 10-30 minutes before meals and can be combined with
other OGLDs to improve glucose control.158 (Level III)
• The TOSCA IT, a multicentre, pragmatic trial, over 5.7 years, found the incidence
of CV events was similar with SUs (predominantly glimepiride and gliclazide)
vs. pioglitazone as add on treatment to metformin; with the conclusion that
SUs and pioglitazone were equally safe with regard to CV risk.159 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• In the recent CVOT (CAROLINA trial) of adults with T2DM and elevated
CV risk, the head-to-head RCT comparing linagliptin (a DPP4-i) to SU
(glimepiride), resulted in a non-inferior risk of a composite CV outcome.
This study demonstrated non-inferior CV safety for linagliptin compared to
glimepiride. This has eliminated the stigma of elevated CV risk previously
associated with SUs.160 (Level I)

Note:
Glibenclamide is metabolised by the liver but its metabolites are active and excreted by the kidney. It is
contraindicated in renal impairment. Other second-generation SUs (glimepiride, gliclazide and glipizide)
may still be used in renal impairment with caution.
Refer to Appendix 7 for dose adjustment in renal impairment
Meglitinides
• These are short acting insulin secretagogues that bind to different sites
within the SU receptor. It has a shorter half-life than SUs.161 (Level I)
• It should be taken within 10 minutes before main meals.
• It is primarily used to control PPG and reduces HbA1c by 1.0%-1.2%.161 (Level I)
• It can be added to other OGLDs except SU.
• It is associated with less risk of weight gain compared to SUs and hypoglycaemia
may be less frequent.148 (Level I)

SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs)
• AGIs e.g. acarbose reduces the rate of absorption of polysaccharides in the
proximal small intestine by inhibiting α-glucosidase enzymes. They should be
taken with main meals.163 (Level I)
• It lowers PPG without causing hypoglycaemia and reduces HbA1c by 0.5%-
0.8%.163 (Level I)
• AGI significantly reduced risk of incident T2DM from IGT by 23%, whereas in
those with IGT or T2DM, the impact on CV outcomes was neutral.164,165 (Level I)
• The common side effects are bloating, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and
flatulence.163,164 (Level I) 166 (Level II-1)

Thiazolidinediones (TZD)
• TZDs are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ)
agonists and act primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle, adipose
tissue and liver.
• TZDs reduce HbA1c by 0.5%-1.4%.167,168 (Level I)
• Improvement in glycaemic control may only be seen after six weeks with
maximum effect at six months.169 (Level I)
• Side effects include weight gain, fluid retention, heart failure, macular
oedema and osteoporosis.167,168,170,171 (Level I)
• The majority of fractures associated with TZD use were in the distal upper or
lower limb, as opposed to the classic sites of osteoporotic fractures.172 (Level I)
• The use of lower dose may confer glycaemic efficacy while minimising risk of
side effects.173 (Level II-1)
• TZDs are contraindicated in patients with CCF170 (Level I) and liver failure.

Incretins – Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4-i) and glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) analogue
• The incretin system has become an important target in the treatment of
T2DM.
• After meals, incretins (GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide [GIP])174 (Level II-2) are released; these augment glucose-induced
insulin secretion and suppress glucagon release thus reducing hepatic
glucose output, and reducing plasma glucose in a glucose dependent manner.
• Incretins, at pharmacological levels, reduce gastric motility (thus slowing
glucose absorption)175 (Level II-2) and increase satiety by acting on centres in the
brain.176 (Level II-1)
• The incretin effect is markedly decreased in T2DM, resulting in delayed and
reduced insulin release as well as lack of suppression of glucagon release
after a meal.177 (Level I)
• Agents that increase the effect of incretins have been proven to improve
glucose control. 2 classes of drugs have recently been developed: DPP4-i
(incretin enhancer) and GLP-1 analogue or GLP1-RA (incretin mimetic).178,179 (Level I)
A. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4-i)
• DPP4-i lower HbA1c by 0.5%-0.8%.180-185 (Level I)
• They are weight neutral and have a minimal risk of hypoglycaemia.186-190 (Level I)
• DPP4-i CVOTs (CARMELINA, CAROLINA, TECOS, SAVOR-TIMI)160,191-193 (Level I)
have confirmed CV safety [Refer to Appendix 8 DPP4-i CVOT table].
• They are efficacious and safe in the elderly and all stages of DKD (See
Appendix 7 for dose adjustment in renal failure).
• Saxagliptin is not recommended in patients with pre-existing heart failure6
(Level III) as it has been shown to be associated with increased risk of hospital
admission for heart failure.193 (Level I)
• The VERIFY study has confirmed a delay in loss of glycaemic control when
combination therapy (metformin + vildagliptin) is initiated within 24 months
of diagnosis, as compared to sequential therapy.194 (Level I)

B. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) – will be discussed in
Injectable therapies.
• Currently, all available GLP1-RAs are in the form of injectables.
• However, oral semaglutide may be made available in the near future.
Sodium-glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i)
• This class of drugs selectively inhibits SGLT2, a transporter in the proximal
tubule, thus reducing glucose reabsorption leading to an increase in urinary
glucose excretion.195-198 (Level I)
• It reduces HbA1c by 0.5%-1.0%.199 (Level I)
• Additional effects of treatment include weight loss (1.8 kg-2.7 kg) and
reduction of SBP (2.7-4.8 mmHg) and DBP (1.8-2.0 mmHg). 199 (Level I)
• It has a lower risk of hypoglycaemia, similar to placebo.200 (Level I)
• It can be combined with other OGLDs/GLP1-RA/insulin to improve glucose
control.(Level I)
• SGLT2-i (EMPA-REG and CANVAS)201,202 (Level I) have been shown to significantly
reduce MACE endpoints in T2DM with ASCVD [Refer to Appendix 8 SGLT2-i
CVOT table].
• SGLT2-i have been proven to reduce hospitalisation for heart failure as a
primary as well as secondary prevention (EMPA-REG, CANVAS and DECLARETIMI and VERTIS-CV).203-205,952 (Level I)
› In two dedicated heart failure studies; (DAPA-HF)206 (Level I) and EMPERORReduced951 (Level I) that included patients with heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction (HFrEF), addition of SGLT2-i significantly reduced
hospitalisation for heart failure and CV death by 25% (HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.680.84, p<0.0001)950 vs. placebo. These studies included patients with and
without T2DM.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Efficacy of glucose lowering effects of SGLT2-i are dependent on renal
function and it is not recommended for glucose lowering, in patients with
moderate to severe renal impairment.207,208 (Level I)
› SGLT2-i reduce intraglomerular pressure independent of glucose levels.
› A reduction of eGFR of approximately 5 ml/min/1.73 m2 may occur in the
first 1-3 months of starting an SGLT2-i.
› SGLT2-i have been shown to be effective in reducing renal endpoints
(reduction in macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD and
renal death) down to eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, in patients with DKD.209 (Level I)
› Do not initiate at eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 but, may continue if already
initiated (see Section 5.2).
• Side effects of SGLT2-i include:
› significant increase in urogenital mycotic infection and UTI;202,207,210 (Level I)
› small but significant increase in risk of DKA, volume depletion207,210 (Level I)
and osmotic diuresis;211 (Level I) and

3.6.2 Injectable agents
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA)210,213,214
• GLP-1 RAs currently available include exenatide IR and ER (once weekly),
liraglutide (daily) and lixisenatide (daily) and, the once-weekly agents
dulaglutide and semaglutide.
• GLP-1RAs have been shown to reduce HbA1C (~0.8-1.6%), body weight (~1.04.1 kg). Their effects are dose dependent. The weight reduction is due to the
effect on satiety and delay in gastric emptying.
• Common side effects of all GLP1-RAs are mainly gastro-intestinal i.e. nausea,
vomiting and diarrhoea.215 (Level I)
A. Exenatide
• Exenatide formulations available: immediate release (IR) and extended
release (ER) formulations.208 (Level I) Exenatide ER is the more commonly used
preparation.
• Exenatide monotherapy results in a reduction of HbA1c by 1.53%, comparable
to metformin.216 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Exenatide ER,
› results in superior HbA1c reduction, when compared to sitagliptin and
pioglitazone as add on to metformin.217 (Level I) vs. sitagliptin and pioglitazone
individually.217 (Level I)
› is significantly superior to basal insulin glargine as add on therapy to
maximum OGLDs.218 (Level I)
› can be added on to SGLT2-i (dapagliflozin) for further HbA1c reduction.219 (Level I)
› can be added on to existing basal insulin glargine therapy; with further HbA1c
reduction and significantly more patients reaching HbA1c <7.0%.220 (Level I)
• Progressive weight loss is seen with its use.221-223 (Level I)
• In the EXSCEL study where Exenatide ER was compared to placebo in a highrisk population, the occurrence of primary MACE endpoints (death from CV
causes, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke) did not significantly differ between
the two groups [Refer to Appendix 8 GLP1-RA CVOT table].224 (Level I)
B. Liraglutide
• Liraglutide is indicated for use in combination with OGLDs and/or insulin. It
results in reductions in mean HbA1c of 0.8%-1.4%225-228 (Level I)
• There is no increased risk of hypoglycaemia and it may result in weight loss
of up to 3.2 kg.229 (Level I)
• In patients who are on combination of metformin and SU with an HbA1c
<10.0%, the addition of liraglutide produced similar glycaemic improvement
compared to insulin glargine without any increased risk of hypoglycaemia
and weight gain.225 (Level I)
• In the LEADER study, MACE endpoints were significantly reduced in the
liraglutide group vs. placebo [Refer to Appendix 8 GLP1-RA CVOT table].230 (Level I)
C. Lixisenatide
• Lixisenatide can be used in combination with OGLDs and/or basal insulin.231,232 (Level I)
• Monotherapy with lixisenatide results in a HbA1c reduction of 0.5%-0.7%.231,232
(Level I)
• In Malaysia, lixisenatide is available as a fixed-ratio combination iGlarLixi
which combines basal insulin glargine with prandial GLP-1RA lixisenatide.
› Once daily iGlarLixi was superior to iGlar monotherapy when used with
metformin with or without a second OGLD and in patients inadequately
controlled on basal insulin with or without OGLDs, with superior weight
reduction.233-235 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
› Switching to iGlarLixi is superior to continuing maximally tolerated GLP-1
RA. Significantly more iGlarLixi patients achieve HbA1c <7% compared to
remaining on GLP1-RA alone.236,237 (Level I)
• Lixisenatide given to a very high-risk population with MI or hospitalisation
for unstable angina and followed up for a mean of 25 months showed no
significant difference in any components of the composite MACE endpoints
[Refer to Appendix 8 GLP1-RA CVOT table].238 (Level I)
• Refer to package insert for dosing schedule.
D. Dulaglutide
• Dulaglutide is a long acting once weekly GLP1-RA.
• Dulaglutide:
› monotherapy was slightly superior to metformin.239 (Level I)
› as add-on to metformin, is superior to sitagliptin.240,241 (Level I)
› can be combined with glimepiride for further significant HbA1c reduction. 242
(Level I)
› can be added on to a SGLT2-i for further reduction in HbA1c on a background
of with or without metformin.243 (Level I)
• In comparison to other GLP1-RAs, dulaglutide showed:
› similar efficacy in comparison to daily liraglutide. However, liraglutide
demonstrated greater weight loss (3.6 kg vs. 2.9 kg).244 (Level I)
› was significantly superior to exenatide BD with better HbA1c reduction
when added to OGLDs.245 (Level I)
• As add-on to insulin, addition of dulaglutide:
› on a background of basal insulin glargine, resulted in significant further
HbA1c reduction;246 (Level I) and
› on a background of prandial insulin, was superior to basal insulin glargine,
with significantly greater HbA1c reduction and a weight difference of 3.2 kg
between groups.247 (Level I)
• In the REWIND study (over 5 years), which consisted predominantly of patients
with CVD risk factors (70%), and established CVD (30%), dulaglutide was
associated with a significant reduction of primary 3-point MACE endpoints
[Refer to Appendix 8 GLP1-RA CVOT table]. 248 (Level I)
E. Semaglutide
• Semaglutide is a once-weekly injectable human GLP-1RA (0.5 mg, 1 mg).
• It has a dose dependent effect on HbA1c and weight reduction.249 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Semaglutide in both doses demonstrated superior glycaemic efficacy
compared to:
› placebo in drug naïve patients.250 (Level I)
› sitagliptin on a background of metformin + TZD.251 (Level I)
› canagliflozin on a background of metformin.252 (Level I)
• Semaglutide can be effectively added on to SGLT2-i + existing OGLDs for
further HbA1c reduction.253 (Level I)
• Semaglutide is the most potent GLP1-RA with demonstrated superior
glycaemic efficacy to exenatide ER,
254 (Level I) dulaglutide255 (Level I) and
liraglutide.256 (Level I)
• Semaglutide (both doses) has demonstrated superior glycaemic efficacy
vs. basal insulin glargine, when added on to insulin naïve patients257 (Level I) or
already on basal insulin glargine.258 (Level I)
• In the CVOT (SUSTAIN 6) over 104 weeks, semaglutide was associated with a
significant reduction in risk of 3-point MACE [Refer to Appendix 8 GLP1-RA
CVOT table].259 (Level I)
• Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for
progression of retinopathy and slower dose titration may be warranted260

Precautions for GLP1-RA
• They are not a substitute for insulin.
• Nausea and vomiting are common side effects and patients need to

3.6.3 General guidelines for use of oral glucose lowering drugs
• OGLDs can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other OGLDs,
and/or injectable agents (e.g. insulin, GLP-RAs).
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Early combination therapy that addresses different pathophysiological
defects in T2DM should be considered in the newly diagnosed T2DM
patient.194,263 (Level I)
› The VERIFY study has confirmed a delay in loss of glycaemic control when
combination therapy (metformin + vildagliptin) is initiated within 24
months of diagnosis.194 (Level I)
› Though these results have not been generalised to other OGLDs, it
indicates the potential benefits of early combination therapy.
• Agents that are known to improve fasting hyperglycaemia include metformin
and TZDs while others reduce mainly postprandial hyperglycaemia.
› As first-line therapy, metformin is the preferred choice.264 (Level I) Other
OGLDs are acceptable alternatives if metformin is not tolerated or
contraindicated.
• If glycaemic targets are not achieved despite compliance, intensification of
treatment should be made without delay.6 (Level III)
› Barriers to medication taking should be addressed in patients with poor
compliance.6 (Level III)
› The medication regimen should be re-evaluated at regular intervals (3-6
months) and adjusted as needed to incorporate new patient factors such as:
- ASCVD,
- heart failure,
- DKD,
- hypoglycaemia event,
- weight gain,
- cost concern; and
- change in socio-economic support.
• If monotherapy fails, combination of other agents is recommended.265 (Level III)
• Compliance may be improved with daily dosing or fixed-dose combination
(FDC) OGLDs.
• OGLDs are usually not the first-line therapy in stress hyperglycaemia. Insulin
therapy is recommended.
• Targets for control should be individualised.
• There may be a role for de-escalation of OGLD doses/medication. Reasons for
this include improvement in glycaemic control, successful weight loss (from
lifestyle intervention), change in glycaemic goals (especially in the setting
of elderly patients), development of new co-morbidities, development of
intolerable side effects, or treatment ineffectiveness.6 (Level III)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
3.6.4 Combination of OGLDs, GLP-1RA and insulin
• If targets have not been reached after optimal OGLD therapy, consider
adding:
› pre-bed basal insulin,266-270 (Level I)
› pre-dinner premixed insulin;271,272 (Level I) or
› GLP-1RA, as an alternative to intermediate or long-acting insulin with less
incidence of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.218,257 (Level I)
• Combining insulin with the following OGLDs/injectable agent has been
shown to be effective:
› Biguanide (metformin),269,273,274 (Level I)
› Insulin secretagogue (SU),275 (Level I)
› AGIs,163,276 (Level I)
› DPP4-i,277-279 (Level I)
› SGLT2-i,195-198 (Level I)
› GLP1-RA,210,229,232 (Level I)
› Insulin sensitizer (TZD)280 (Level I) – (combination of TZD and insulin is not
generally recommended because of increased risk of fluid retention and
congestive cardiac failure (CCF).
• Basal insulin dose should be increased until target FPG is achieved safely.
› If HbA1c targets are not achieved despite normal FPG, then PPG should be
monitored.
› If HbA1c target is not achieved, further insulin intensification is required.
• In patients who are on insulin, metformin should be continued unless it is not
tolerated or contraindicated.
• Even though glycaemic targets are important shared objectives (patient
and HCP) due diligence should be given to progressive weight gain and
exacerbation of insulin resistance (IR) especially those patients who are
overweight and obese at start of therapy.
• Caution needs to be exercised when intensifying insulin dose/regimen with
attention to weight gain and unrecognised hypoglycaemia.281 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Recommendations: Combination of glucose lowering drugs
1. OGLDs can be used as monotherapy or in combination
with other OGLDs, and/or injectable agents (e.g. insulin,
GLP-1RA). Early combination therapy that addresses
different pathophysiological defects in T2DM may be
considered in recently diagnosed patients.
Grade A
2. As first line therapy, metformin is the preferred
choice. Other OGLDs are acceptable alternatives, if
metformin is not tolerated or contra-indicated.
Grade A
4. Cost of medications is a barrier and should be given
due consideration when choosing treatment options.
Grade C
5. If targets are not met after optimal combined OGLDs
therapy, consider adding GLP-1RA or insulin.
Grade A
6. HbA1c remains an important target. If glycaemic
targets are not achieved, intensification of treatment
should be made every 3-6 months.
Grade C
3. Medication regimen choice should address:
a. co-morbidities such as ASCVD, heart failure and
DKD; and
b. risk for specific adverse drug effects, safety and
tolerability.
Grade A
Grade C
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
3.6.5 Initiation, optimisation and intensification of insulin therapy
Adapted from Malaysian CPG on Insulin therapy in T2DM.282 (Level III)
• T2DM is a progressive disease characterised by worsening glycaemia due to
progressive decline in beta cell function.283 (Level I)
• This ultimately renders OGLDs ineffective and the majority of patients with
T2DM will require insulin therapy.
› Persistent hyperglycaemia in spite of optimal OGLDs and weight loss
suggests beta cell failure.
› However, it is important to exclude concomitant illnesses such as; chronic
infections, malignancy, or medications as a cause of the weight loss.
• Insulin therapy is suitable at all stages of T2DM, for all ages, and with a wide
range of treatment options and regimens. Insulin can be combined with
OGLDs or GLP-1RA.
• Insulin therapy should be considered in the following situations:
› inadequate glycaemic control on optimal dose and number of OGLDs284 (Level I)
(Refer to Figure 3-2).
› as short-term use in the following;
- acute illness or surgery,
- pregnancy,
- breast-feeding,
- severe metabolic decompensation (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar
hyperglycaemic state).
› as initial therapy in newly diagnosed T2DM,
- in presence of symptomatic hyperglycaemia and evidence of ongoing
catabolism,6 (Level III)
- when HbA1c >10% or FPG >13.0 mmol/L;6 (Level III) or
- as part of early insulinisation treatment regime.285 (Level I) 286 (Level II-2)
Insulin types and regimens
A. Insulin types
• The insulin currently used in this country are human insulin or insulin
analogue. Both types of insulin are further divided into prandial, basal and
premixed according to their pharmacokinetic profiles.
› Prandial insulin is administered pre-meal because of its short or rapid
onset of action in controlling postprandial glucose excursion. It is also used
in insulin pumps.
› Basal insulin is administered once or twice daily. The intermediate or longacting pharmacokinetic profile covers the basal insulin requirements in
between meals and through the night.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
› Premixed insulin is biphasic insulin that incorporates both the short
or rapid-acting insulin with intermediate-acting insulin into a single
preparation to cover for both postprandial glucose excursion as well as
basal insulin needs.
› Co-formulation insulin is a combination of a rapid acting and basal insulin
existing separately in one formulation. The basal and prandial components
do not interact, and their distinct pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
profiles are not compromised.

• The time course of action of different insulin preparations may vary in
different individuals, or at different times in the same individual.
› The variations and time periods indicated in Table 3-18 should be
considered as general guidelines only.
› The higher the dose of the insulin, the longer the duration of action.
• Long acting insulin analogues, which have less peak, result in lower
hypoglycaemic episodes and less weight gain compared to human basal
insulin.267 (Level I)
• Glargine U300 compared to Glargine U100 is non-inferior in achieving
glycaemic control but with less overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia.287-291 (Level I)
› The dose of Glargine U300 needed is generally 10%-17% higher compared
to Glargine U100.287-290 (Level I)
• Premix/co-formulation insulins can be used to reduce the number of
injections needed.
› Co-formulation insulin analogues (insulin degludec/insulin aspart) compared
to premixed biphasic insulin aspart is non-inferior in HbA1C reduction
but with lower FPG and lower rate of confirmed nocturnal or overall
hypoglycaemia.292-294 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
B. Insulin regimen
• An ideal insulin regimen should mimic the physiological insulin response to
meals and endogenous hepatic glucose production.
• The choice of insulin regimen should be individualised, based on the patient’s
glycaemic profile, dietary pattern and lifestyle.
• The main advantage of insulin over other GLDs is that insulin lowers glucose
in a dose-dependent manner to almost any glycaemic target. The main
limitation of insulin is hypoglycaemia.
Initiation
• Insulin initiation can be done safely in an outpatient setting.
• Option for initiation include:
› basal insulin.287-290 (Level I)
- can be initiated at 10U a day or 0.1-0.2 U/kg/day,
- set FPG target and choose evidence-based titration algorithm e.g.
increase by 2 U every 3 days to reach target FPG without hypoglycaemia;
or
- Adjust 2 U every week based on 3 days’ glucose readings.
› Premixed insulin once or twice daily.
• All patients prescribed insulin therapy should be advised to perform selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and empowered to self-adjust their
insulin doses (Refer to Section 3.8).
› Patients should be educated regarding symptoms of hypoglycaemia and
its management.
› Insulin dose optimisation requires gradual, safe and prompt titration
according to SMBG.295 (Level I)
Intensification
• After titration of basal insulin, if the HbA1C is not at target but FPG is at
target, intensification of insulin therapy, by adding prandial insulin or
converting to premixed insulin is needed.
› Meta-analyses of trials comparing rapid acting insulin and human regular
insulin in patients with T2DM have not reported important differences in
HbA1C or hypoglycaemia.296,297 (Level I)
› Insulin regimen intensification can be twice, thrice or four times (basal
bolus) daily.
› Insulin pump may be considered in patients who are still not controlled
while on basal-bolus regime.298 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Barriers to insulin therapy
• There are numerous barriers to effective insulin therapy. These include
patients and healthcare providers’ factors e.g. non-adherence to insulin
(missing/skipping doses), inappropriate reduction of insulin dose, wrong
time of injections as well as fear of hypoglycaemia.
• The biggest barrier is adherence, and this should be adequately ascertained
prior to any effort to intensify insulin therapy.299 (Level II-3)

SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
General guidelines for long term use of insulin
• The basal intermediate acting insulin should be administered pre-bed
(preferably not earlier than 10 p.m.) because of the risk of hypoglycaemia in
the early hours of the morning if given earlier.
• It is not necessary to have an extra meal or snack after intermediate or long
acting insulin.
• Requirements of high dose of insulin (total daily dose >1.5 U/kg-2.0 U/kg)
should prompt a search for an underlying cause/secondary problem such as:
› non-adherence,
› incorrect dosing, timing and injection technique (Available at Forum for
injection technique guidelines, Malaysia at http://mems.my/forum-forinjection-technique-malasyia-fit-my/); and
› occult infections.
• In general, total daily dose of prandial insulin should not be >50% of total
daily dose.
• Patients should be encouraged to rotate their injection sites in the abdomen.
• Insulin therapy may cause weight gain through improved conservation of
ingested calories, defensive eating from fear of hypoglycaemia or change in
appetite regulation centrally.281 (Level I)
› This effect is exaggerated if “unphysiological” dose of insulin is used.
› Monitor weight – progressive weight gain should raise the possibility of
too much insulinisation. Weight gain can be minimised by improving insulin
sensitivity through diet, lifestyle measures or using insulin sensitizing
OGLDs and, hence avoiding need for large doses of insulin.
3.6.6 Biosimilar insulin
• Pharmaceutical companies other than the original multi-national ones also
manufacture market-similar insulins.
• Because none of the insulin manufacturing processes are identical, this
results in insulin that might become biosimilarly different from the originator
insulin to a certain extent.300
• The National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) guidelines for
market approval require that the manufacturer demonstrate that the insulin
has a safety and efficacy profile that is similar to that of the original insulin
formulation.
• Examples of available biosimilar insulins in Malaysia are Insugen-R, Insugen-N,
Insugen-30/70, and Basalog (Glargine).
• Local post-marketing clinical studies have confirmed non-inferiority in
efficacy and safety vs. original.301
SECTION 3

MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
3.8 Monitoring
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
› SMBG is important in people with insulin treated T2DM.
› SMBG may improve glycaemic control in people with non-insulin
treated T2DM with short diabetes duration, HbA1c ≥8% and/or
obesity.
› Mobile health may promote diabetes self-management, although
more evidence on application (apps) accuracy, data security,
accessibility and sustainability are required.
• Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
› CGM technology has evolved significantly in recent years with
emerging evidence as a useful tool in glycaemic monitoring in
people with T2DM.
› Ambulatory glucose profile and key glucose metrics derived from
CGM reports provide objective insights into individual glycaemic
variability that facilitate improved glycaemic management and
promote self-engagement.
3.8.1 Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
• HbA1c assay must be standardised to the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP).
› NGSP results can be directly correlated with clinical outcomes especially
DCCT305 (Level I) and UKPDS306 (Level I) trials and therefore, the decision by most
guidelines to utilise HbA1c for diabetes care goals and targets (NGSP
website is available at http://www.ngsp.org/ ).307 (Level III)
• The assay quality has been improved and calibrated via the International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC). IFCC results are more accuracy-based
using latest and newer assay techniques (Conversion between NGSP and
IFCC is available at http://www.ngsp.org/convert1.asp ).307 (Level III)
• Correlation between IFCC and NGSP is good, but the absolute numbers are
different. IFCC HbA1c results are consistently 1.5-2.0% lower than NGSP
HbA1c results. NGSP HbA1c is reported as % while IFCC HbA1c is now reported
as mmol HbA1c/mol Hb.307 (Level III)

is available as well. NGSP: National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program; IFCC: International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry.
Adapted from Nathan DM et al 2008,308(Level II-1) NGSP website.307 (Level III)
• Depending on the country and laboratory, HbA1c results may be reported as
% (NGSP), mmol/mol which is mmol of HbA1c/mol of haemoglobin (IFCC) or
estimated average glucose (eAG) as mmol/L. It can also be a combination of
any of the 3.
• In adults with T2DM, HbA1c can be measured at:72 (Level III)
› 3-6 monthly intervals, until the HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy,
› 6 monthly intervals once the HbA1c level and glucose-lowering therapy is
stable.
• HbA1c has a strong predictive value for diabetes complications.
› Reduction in HbA1c will result in a reduction in risk of microvascular
complications in the immediate short-term24 (Level I) and macrovascular
complications in the long-term.24,309,310 (Level I)
• HbA1c target should be individualised.
› Therapy in most patients with T2DM should be targeted to achieve HbA1c
≤7.0%.
› A more aggressive target (≤6.5%) should be attempted in those with long
life-expectancy, no co-morbidities and in those whose targets can be
achieved without causing severe hypoglycaemia (Refer to Table 3-6).
• Despite the standardisation, sometimes the measured HbA1c value may still
at times not reflect the true level of glycaemia (glycation gap) due to various
causes. 18 (Level I) 19 (Level III)

• For haemoglobin variants, NGSP via their website has published a list of HbA1c
methods and any possible interference (This is available at http://www.ngsp.
org/interf.asp.
• Recognise the occurrence of a possible glycation gap and in what
circumstances these may occur.
• Other methods of measuring glycaemia in these situations should be
considered, as listed below:41 (Level III)
› SMBG (preferably quality controlled) capillary glucose profiles – this is the
most ideal/practical method; or
› total glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins) using
boronate affinity methods. These are available in select hospitals.
• Other limitations of HbA1c are that it does not provide information on glucose
variability and does not capture hypoglycaemia. In such circumstances, a
combination of SMBG and HbA1c is appropriate.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Point of care testing for HbA1c
• Point of care (POC) devices should not be used for diagnosis of T2DM.312 (Level I)
• However, POC devices are gaining popularity.
› POC devices fill an unmet need – making HbA1c assessment possible in the
more remote/interior regions of the country where laboratory facilities
are not readily available.
• Initial devices tended to underestimate HbA1c (i.e. different from lab-based
levels by -0.962 to +0.1). But this negative bias has been improved by more
recent POC devices (+0.28 to +0.43).312 (Level I)
• This degree of imprecision may adversely affect management decision.
• As precision and accuracy in newer POC devices continue to improve, they
have the potential to be as accurate as laboratory based HbA1c. This can
reduce cost, waiting time and necessity for multiple visits, improve QoL, and
increase accessibility to remote/interior areas and also for the paediatric
population (minimal blood needed).
• The main utility for POC devices will be in the monitoring of diabetes
management in follow-up of patients.
Fructosamine estimation
• The evidence that correlates fructosamine to average glucose levels and its
prognostic significance are not as strong as HbA1c.313 (Level III)
• It is an alternative to HbA1c in monitoring glycaemic control in patients in
whom HbA1c measurements may be inaccurate.
• It only reflects glycaemic control over the recent 2-3 weeks.
3.8.2 Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
• SMBG is the method of choice in assessing glycaemic control and preventing
hypoglycaemia.
› As part of an educational initiative, SMBG should be recommended in
patients treated with insulin(Level 1) and is desirable for those on OGLDs.6(Level III)
In out-patient setting
• Insulin treated T2DM
› Recommend routine SMBG to evaluate glycaemic control and prevent
hypoglycaemia.(Level I)
› Frequency and timing of SMBG vary based on types of insulin regimen
(Refer Section 3.6.5).6
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Non-insulin treated T2DM
› Earlier RCTs and meta-analyses suggest lack of benefit with SMBG in this
group.314 (Level I) 315 (Level II)
› However, recent meta-analyses and RCTs suggest that SMBG could
modestly reduce HbA1c by 0.12%-0.33%, especially in those with:316-322 (Level I)
- short duration of diabetes,
- suboptimal glycaemic control (baseline HbA1c ≥8%),
- obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2).
› Greater glycaemic improvements were reported with:316-319,322,323 (Level I)
- more frequent SMBG,
- high levels of health literacy,
- structured SMBG and evaluation of technique with regular feedback*,
- adjustment of therapy (diet, physical activity and GLDs).**
*By health care providers (clinicians, diabetes-skilled allied health personnel).
** By patients themselves with emphasis on self-management support and on-going patient empowerment
by health care providers.316,323
Frequency and timing of SMBG
• Frequency and timing of SMBG should be tailored based on the patient’s
needs including glycaemic status, drug therapy, treatment goals and lifestyle
(dietary patterns and level of physical activity).(Level II-2)
• Re-evaluation of the need for and frequency of SMBG should be performed
by healthcare providers during each follow-up visit.(Level II-2)
• Ideally, SMBG should be performed on a daily basis in people with insulintreated T2DM or if possible, at least one 24-hour cycle on a weekly basis. (Level II-2)

Role of mobile health (mHealth) in SMBG
• mHealth tools play an emerging role in diabetes prevention and
management.324-328 (Level I)
• Commonly available mHealth tools include:324,325 (Level I)
› short-messaging service (sms),
› apps (e.g. SMBG diary with or without therapy adjustment).
• mHealth may enhance patient engagement and clinical effectiveness.324,329 (Level I)
• mHealth tools should be user-friendly and literacy appropriate.324,329 (Level I)
• Compared to usual care, meta-analyses reported a modest reduction in
HbA1c by 0.44%-0.55%, increased glycaemic goal attainment and improved
self-management.326-328 (Level I)
• More research on apps accuracy, data security, accessibility, sustainability and
long-term health outcomes is required before large-scale implementation.325 (Level I)
For monitoring of glycaemic control in specific populations such as during Ramadan fasting (available

3.8.3 Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
• CGM measures interstitial glucose (which correlates closely to plasma
glucose) via a subcutaneously inserted sensor.
• Glucose readings are measured every 5 to 15 minutes.
• CGM can be classified into two types, retrospective (professional) and realtime (personal or flash).

Clinical benefits of CGM in the management of T2DM
• There is emerging evidence that CGM application in people with T2DM
provide a number of clinical benefits.
› Detection of unrecognised hypoglycaemia/hyperglycaemia and evaluation
of glycaemic variability.
- It provides objective insights into the key glucose metric i.e. time in
range (TIR).331,332 (Level II-1) 333,334 (Level II-2)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
- TIR is defined as percentage of glucose reading and time per day
within the target range of 3.9 mmol/L-10.0 mmol/L by the International
Consensus on TIR.335 (Level III)
› Improved glycaemic control (HbA1c) and/or TIR.
- Shows improvement of HbA1c ranging between 0.3%-0.7%.336-341 (Level I) 342 (Level II)
- Reduction in hypoglycaemia and increase in TIR.339,343 (Level I)
- Flash CGM users reported higher treatment satisfaction.340,341,343 (Level I)
› Effective motivational tool in improving adherence to therapeutic lifestyle
modification.338,344,345 (Level I) 342 (Level II-2)
Limitations and barriers to CGM use
• Cost/reimbursements – CGM is costly and not routinely reimbursed.
• Technological barriers – it is more important to focus on the overall glycaemic
patterns and trends than to focus on the absolute glucose levels. Accuracy
tends to be lower:346-348 (Level II-2) 349,350 (Level III)
› during the first 24 hours of sensor insertion,
› in the low end of glycaemic range; and
› during the phase of rapidly changing glucose levels related to time-lag
between interstitial and plasma glucose.
• Human (user) factors – adequate training is required for proper use and
interpretation of the report.335,349,351 (Level III)
Considerations for use of CGM in T2DM
• Advances in CGM technology have made it a potentially useful tool in the
day-to-day management of T2DM and may be considered in the following
situations:
› HbA1c above target despite intensive insulin therapy with multiple daily
injections [Grade B],
› suspected unrecognised hypoglycaemia, impaired hypoglycaemia awareness,
dawn phenomenon or delayed postprandial hyperglycaemia [Grade B],
› Special populations at high risk of severe hypoglycaemia (e.g. the elderly,
patients with advanced DKD) [Grade C], and
› Discrepant HbA1c with SMBG [Grade C].
• The choice and frequency of CGM devices should be individualised depending
on the primary goal and patients’ willingness to be actively engaged in their
day-to-day glucose management.
• To derive maximum benefits, it is essential to provide structured diabetes
education, training and support, assisted by a diabetes nurse educator.
SECTION 3

2. To achieve HbA1c ≤7.0%, aim for FPG or pre-prandial
glucose targets of 4.4-7.0 mmol/L and 2-hour PPG
target of 4.4-8.5 mmol/L.
Grade B
3. SMBG should be recommended in patients on insulin
and is desirable for those on OGLDs.
Grade C
4. CGM may be considered in patients with suboptimal
HbA1c or suspected to have unrecognised
hypoglycaemia on intensive insulin therapy.
Grade B
5. Monitoring of glycaemic control, co-morbidities,
complications and other CVD risk factors should
be done at initial visit and whenever indicated
subsequently.
Grade C
1. Glycaemic targets must be individualised. Therapy
in most patients with T2DM should be targeted to
achieve an HbA1c≤7.0% or 6.5% (where appropriate),
if achievable without significant hypoglycaemia.

3.9 Management of co-morbidities in T2DM
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Hypertension:
› Target for initiation of treatment is systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 mmHg
and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mmHg.
› Treatment target is SBP 130-139 mmHg and DBP 70-79 mmHg.
• Hyperlipidaemia
› All individuals with T2DM over the age of 40 should be treated
with a statin regardless of baseline LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) level.
› LDL-C targets have recently been revised to lower levels, according
to category of CV risk.
• Obesity
› A structured lifestyle modification that includes dietary
intervention with VLCD (≤800 kcal) using MRP products has
been shown to be effective in weight loss and reducing HbA1c
in overweight and obese T2DM. Successful weight reduction of
>15% of body weight can result in diabetes remission.
› S/C liraglutide 3.0 mg daily, a recently approved anti-obesity
agent, may be effective for weight loss and reducing HbA1c.
› Comparing lifestyle intervention vs. metabolic surgery, the
surgical group achieved better diabetes remission rates and
was able to sustain better weight reduction after 2-5 years postsurgery. Metabolic surgery should be considered in those who
fulfil the criteria.
• Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
› Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a new proposed
nomenclature to replace NAFLD as it includes a key driver of this
disease which is presence of metabolic dysfunction.
› Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent among
patients with T2DM.
› T2DM is a risk factor for more severe NAFLD.
› Lifestyle intervention is the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD.
› Statin should be prescribed for treatment of dyslipidaemia in
NAFLD patients to reduce the risk of CVD.
› Patients suspected or confirmed to have more severe NAFLD should
be considered for referral to Gastroenterologist/Hepatologist for
further evaluation and management.

MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
3.9.1 Hypertension and T2DM
• Hypertension is a common co-morbidity of T2DM, with a prevalence of 80.4%
among patients who are followed up in the National Diabetes Registry.3 (Level II-3)
• Hypertension should be detected and treated early in the course of T2DM
to prevent CVD and to delay the progression of renal disease and diabetic
retinopathy.
• Reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 10 mmHg or diastolic blood
pressure (DBP) of 5 mmHg, irrespective of whether the patient has T2DM,
is associated with significant reductions in all major CV events by 20%, allcause mortality by 15%, stroke by 35%, coronary events by 20% and heart
failure by 40%.353,354 (Level I)
Treatment threshold
• Pharmacological treatment should be initiated in patients with T2DM when
BP is persistently ≥140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic.
› Meta-analyses have consistently shown significant risk reduction in
mortality, CHD, cerebrovascular disease and heart failure when treatment
is started at SBP ≥140 mm Hg. 355,356 (Level I) and DBP >90 mmHg.354 (Level I)
• Two meta-analyses354,355 (Level I) showed that lowering BP when initial SBP is
<140 mmHg, showed no additional CV benefits. Moreover, a more recent
systematic review found that it increased the risk of CV death (HR 1.15, 95%
CI 1.00,1.32), with no observed extra benefit in MI, stroke, heart failure or
ESKD.356 (Level I)
• There is insufficient evidence to date for benefits of starting treatment
when DBP is <90 mmHg (e.g. patients with high normal BP or 130-139/85-89
mmHg).357 (Level I)
Treatment target for SBP and DBP
• The ACCORD trial358 (Level I) showed no benefit in combined CV endpoints with
SBP <120 mmHg vs. <140 mmHg.
• A more recent meta-analysis359 (Level I) demonstrated an increase of adverse
events,357 (Level I) with SBP <130 mmHg.
• In contrast, the SPRINT trial (patients with hypertension without T2DM),
lowering SBP to <120 mmHg vs. <140 mmHg resulted in 25% lower rates of
primary composite outcomes of MI, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke,
heart failure or death from CV causes.360 (Level I)
• In high risk patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease, lowering SBP
to <120 mmHg and DBP <70 mmHg, studies361-366 (Level I) report adverse CV
outcomes supporting the existence of a J-curve phenomenon. This supports
targets for SBP of 130-139 mmHg and DBP 70-79 mmHg.(Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• In those who do not have pre-existing CHD, but have a higher risk of stroke
(such as Asian patients) and DKD, lower SBP target of <130 mmHg (but not
<120 mmHg) might be appropriate provided that it is well tolerated, to lower
the risk of stroke359 (Level I) and albuminuria.355,367 (Level I)
Management
• Non-pharmacological management cannot be overemphasized.
› Dietary counselling should target an optimal body weight.
› Dietary sodium restriction is advisable.
• Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are the first-line pharmacological
treatment of choice for patients with T2DM and hypertension.
› They are found to be more effective than other drug classes in reducing
the risk of CHD, all-cause death and composite of stroke, CHD, and heart
failure.359 (Level I)
• ACE inhibitors have been regarded as drug of choice based on extensive
data.368,369 (Level I)
› If an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated, an ARB should be considered.370 (Level I)
› ARBs have been reported to be superior to other non-RAS blocker
antihypertensive drugs in terms of slowing the progression of nephropathy
at the microalbuminuric and overt nephropathy stages.370-373 (Level I)
• Multiple drug therapy is generally required to achieve BP targets.
› 90% of patients require three antihypertensive medications to achieve
target.117 (Level I)
› Diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers and peripheral
alpha-blockers may be used as add-on therapy.
• Combination ACE inhibitor and ARB is not recommended.374 (Level I)

Recommendations: Hypertension and T2DM
1. For patients with T2DM, the treatment threshold
for starting pharmacological therapy is ≥140 mmHg
systolic and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic.
Grade A
2. No CV benefit is seen for starting pharmacological
therapy in patients with T2DM whose BP are in the
high normal range: 130-139/80-89 mmHg.
Grade A
4. Pharmacological treatment should be initiated in
patients with T2DM when the BP is persistently
≥140 mm Hg systolic and/or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic.
Grade A
5. ARBs or ACEIs are the first-line BP agents of choice
for patients with T2DM and hypertension.
Grade A
6. Combined use of ACE-i and ARB is not recommended.
Grade A
3. In patients with T2DM with hypertension, it is
recommended for individuals without pre-existing
CHD and who are at higher risk of stroke or DKD to:
a. target SBP <130 mmHg (if tolerated but, not to
<120 mmHg),
b. target DBP to 70-79 mmHg, but not <70 mmHg.
Grade A
Grade A
3.9.2 Hyperlipidaemia and T2DM
• T2DM is a CHD defining disease.
• Control of hyperglycaemia alone has a modest and heterogeneous effect on
reduction of CVD.310,376 (Level I) and may take long periods to manifest.377 (Level I)
• In contrast, multifactorial intervention has been shown to reduce microvascular
complications, CV events and mortality in the STENO-2 study.35,36 (Level I)
• Thus, efforts must also be directed to address other risk factors such as
dyslipidaemia, hypertension and prior CV events.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Screening
• In adult patients, test for lipid disorders at least annually and more often if
needed to achieve goals.
› Non-fasting sample can be used for assessment of lipid parameters.
› If non-fasting TG is elevated (>2.3 mmol/L), a fasting sample is required.
• In adolescents with T2DM, screening for lipid disorders should be done
at diagnosis after glycaemic control is achieved. If lipid values are within
targets, screening should be repeated annually thereafter.6,378-380 (Level III)
• CV risk calculators for primary prevention are not recommended as
individuals with T2DM are already considered high risk and all CV risk factors
should be aggressively managed (Refer to Section 5.4-A).
Targets
A. Primary target: LDL-C
• All patients over the age of 40 should be treated with a statin regardless of
baseline LDL cholesterol level (Refer Table 3-26).381,382 (Level I)
› Statin is not recommended in women of child-bearing potential who are
not using adequate contraception and is contraindicated during pregnancy.
• The LDL-C targets depends on the patient’s CV risk category (Table 3-26).
› Very low LDL-C level achieved by newer lipid lowering drugs had shown
further CV risk reduction in large scale clinical trials proportionate to the
degree of LDL-C lowering.383-390 (Level I) The absolute risk reduction is most
evident in patients with higher CV risk.

• Lifestyle modification focusing on:
› reduction of saturated fat, trans-fat and cholesterol intake,
› increasing intake of dietary n-3 fatty acids, viscous fibre and plant stanols /
sterols,
› weight loss (if indicated); and
› increasing physical activity
• Lowering LDL-C is the main aim of treatment and statins are the first-line
lipid lowering drug.
• Statin therapy should be intensified to achieve LDL-C goal before considering
combination therapy.
• If the target LDL-C is not achieved with maximal tolerated dose of statin
therapy, combination therapy with ezetimibe is recommended.384,385 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• For very high-risk patients, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9
(PCSK9) inhibitors should be considered if maximal tolerated dose of statin
and ezetimibe fail to achieve LDL-C targets.387-390 (Level I)
• In patients with high TG, improving diabetes control and lifestyle modification
is emphasized.
• Investigate for secondary causes, if fasting TG >5.7 mmol/L and consider
pharmacological therapy with fibrate and/or fish oil (2-4g/day) to reduce the
risk of pancreatitis.
• Nicotinic acid should only be used in patients with high risk of pancreatitis
with a TG level of >10 mmol/L, in those who do not respond adequately to
fibrates and/or fish oil.392-394 (Level I)
• In patients with ASCVD or high CV risk and elevated triglycerides, the
addition of icosapent ethyl 4 mg/day to statin has been shown to reduce CV
risk by 25%.395 (Level I)
• In patients with TG >2.3 mmol/L and low HDL-C, fibrates may be considered
in combination with statin.396-399 (Level III)
• In patients with established retinopathy, fenofibrate reduces progression of
diabetic retinopathy, irrespective of baseline TG/HDL-C level.400,401 (Level I)
• In T2DM patients below 21-year-old without clinical ASCVD, statin is generally
not recommended.378-380 (Level III)

3.9.3 Obesity and T2DM
• In the Malaysian National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015, 33.4% and
30.6% of adults (>18 years old) were overweight and obese (BMI according
to the Malaysian CPG on Management of Obesity, 2004).403,404
• Based on the 2019 National Diabetes Registry405 (Level II-3) data sourced
from primary care health clinics, 84% of individuals with T2DM are either
overweight or obese (Available at: http://ndr.moh.gov.my/report/clinical_audit/
crn1). People with diabetes who are overweight or obese have higher risk of
complications.
• Lifestyle intervention focusing on weight loss showed improvement in HbA1c
and other CV risk factors.79,406 (Level I)
• Many GLDs are associated with weight gain, and attempts should be made
to minimise these medications without compromising glycaemic control or
to switch to alternative agents not associated with weight gain. Table 3-31
shows the GLDs and their effect on weight.

Assessment and treatment of overweight and obesity
• The initial assessment of people with diabetes should include height, weight,
BMI (kg/m2) and waist circumference.
• Weight loss of between 5%-10% will improve glycaemic control, BP, lipid
profile and QoL.79,406 (Level I)
• The goals of therapy are to achieve optimal glycaemic and metabolic control.
• The mainstay of treatment should be through lifestyle modification which
include behavioural change, physical activity and dietary interventions (Refer
Sections 3.5.1 & 3.5.2).

Management
A. Non-pharmacological intervention
• Nutritionally
balanced,
energy-reduced
dietary
interventions
are
recommended for healthier body weight to be achieved (Refer Section 3.5.1).
› Weight loss >5% is needed to see beneficial effect on HbA1c, lipid and
BP.79,408 (Level I)
› Caloric restriction of 1200-1500 kcal/day for women and 1500-1800 kcal/
day for men is useful for rapid weight loss.77 (Level I)
• Use of MRP, with close patient monitoring, can be beneficial. DiRECT, an
open randomised trial involving overweight or obese patients with T2DM
were treated with total diet replacement (825 kcal) at primary care level.
A significant weight loss of 15 kg (24%) and diabetes remission (46%) were
seen in the intervention group.95 (Level I)
• Very low calorie diet (VLCD) with a total MRP of <800 kcal/day may
achieve greater short-term weight loss (10%-15%) with greater glycaemic
improvement, as shown in the DROPLET study.409 (Level I)
› Overweight or obese subjects were managed by their primary care doctors
and given MRP for 8 weeks followed by food re-introduction over 4 weeks.
› At week 13 onwards, subjects were encouraged to take MRP once or twice
daily.
› Significant weight loss at week 12, -9.6 kg (-11.0 kg to -8.2 kg) was seen and
was sustained at 12 months, -7.2 kg (-9.4 kg to -4.9 kg).
› Risk of weight rebound after discontinuing the program was not seen in
this study.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Increased physical activity consisting of at least 150 minute/week of
moderate-intensity exercise (Refer Section 3.5.2).
› This includes muscle strengthening and resistance exercise 2 to 3 times/
week. 410 (Level III)
› Overweight or obese persons with T2DM should increase the exercise
duration to >60 minutes per day/approximately 450 minutes per/week for
weight reduction.135 (Level III)
• Frequent contact with healthcare providers and behavioural therapy should
be part of the intervention.
B. Pharmacological intervention
• Pharmacotherapy can be considered for patients with T2DM with BMI
≥27.0 kg/m2 after failing 6 months of lifestyle modification.403 (Level III)
• Three anti-obesity agents have been approved, phentermine,411,412 (Level I) 413 (Level

C. Surgical intervention
• Bariatric surgery should be considered when lifestyle and pharmacological
interventions have failed in the obese with T2DM and at high CVD risk with
suboptimal glycaemic control.403 (Level III)
• International diabetes organisations developed a consensus treatment423
(Level III) algorithm for metabolic surgery in T2DM (Diabetes Surgery Summit-II,
DSS-II). Metabolic surgery should be recommended for Asians with T2DM as
below:
› ≥37.5 kg/m2,
› ≥32.5 kg/m2 to 37.4 kg/m2 with inadequately controlled hyperglycaemia
despite lifestyle modification and optimal medical treatment; and
› ≥27.5 kg/m2 to 32.5 kg/m2 - it can be considered in those with inadequately
controlled hyperglycaemia despite optimal medical treatment.
• The Asian Consensus Meeting on Metabolic Surgery (ACMOMS) recommends
bariatric surgery for the following persons with diabetes:*424 (Level III)
› >32 kg/m2
› >30 kg/m2 with 1 or more features of metabolic syndrome
*After review of the ACMOMS and DSS-II consensus, the evidence supports
the efficacy of bariatric surgery in the above individuals. However, this should
be performed at centres of excellence that perform high-volume surgery.
• Evaluation for the appropriateness of surgery should be performed by a
multidisciplinary team consisting of endocrinologist, bariatric surgeon,
psychiatrist, dietitian and physiotherapist prior to surgery.423 (Level III)

3.9.4 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
• A new proposed nomenclature for NAFLD is “metabolic associated fatty
liver disease” or MAFLD. The major benefit of this new nomenclature is a
shift towards a diagnosis of inclusion based on the presence of metabolic
dysfunction, the key driver of the disease.949 Note that the following section
still refers to NAFLD.
• Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of liver
conditions characterised by excess accumulation of fat in the liver that is
associated with chronic overnutrition.444 (Level II-2)
• NAFLD is closely associated with obesity and is considered as the liver
manifestation of the metabolic syndrome.444 (Level II-2)
• For a strict definition of NAFLD, significant alcohol intake (more than two
standard drinks/day for men or more one standard drink/day for women),
drugs that can cause hepatic steatosis and other causes of liver diseases (e.g.
chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection) should be excluded.444 (Level II-2)
• Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the more severe form of NAFLD
that is defined histologically by the presence of lobular inflammation and
hepatocyte ballooning.444 (Level II-2)
• Patients with NASH are more likely to develop liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).444 (Level II-2)
• T2DM is a risk factor for NASH and advanced liver fibrosis,445 (Level II-2) which
is one of the leading causes of liver transplantation for cirrhosis and for
HCC.446,447 (Level II-2)
• In Malaysia, the prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM has been
estimated to be 49.6% based on ultrasonography and 72.4% based on
controlled attenuation parameter.448 (Level II-2)
• A study using liver stiffness measurement (measured using transient
elastography e.g. Fibroscan; a non-invasive procedure) estimated the
prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis among patients with diabetes mellitus
to be 21.0%.449 (Level II-2)
• The same study using liver stiffness measurement ≥8 kPa to identify patients
with diabetes mellitus for liver biopsy found that the majority of the patients
had NASH (83.1%) and some degree of liver fibrosis (87.1%), while advanced
liver fibrosis was diagnosed in 36.6%.449 (Level II-2)

assessment of NAFLD in T2DM illustrated as a flow chart refer to Appendix 9.
• Drug-induced liver injury is a common cause of elevated ALT and AST.
› A careful history about intake of medicines (prescribed, over-the-counter
or traditional) or supplements should be obtained.
› If the medicine or supplement is considered to be the cause of the elevated
AST and ALT, it should be stopped.
› The AST and ALT should be repeated 1-3 months later.
• Persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with T2DM and NAFLD may
indicate the presence of NASH. However, normal serum ALT and AST levels
do not exclude NASH and advanced liver fibrosis.450,451 (Level II-2)
• US examination of the liver should be performed in patients with T2DM and
elevated serum ALT and/or AST to diagnose fatty liver and to exclude focal
liver lesion.
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• Non-invasive fibrosis score, such as fibrosis-4 index (refer to Appendix 9),
may be used to risk stratify patients with T2DM and NAFLD.452,453 (Level II-2)
› Patients with a low score are unlikely to have advanced liver fibrosis,
while those with indeterminate or high scores should be referred for liver
stiffness measurement.

SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Recommendations: Assessment of NAFLD
1. Patients with T2DM should have platelet count, and
serum ALT and AST levels performed for assessment
for NASH and advanced liver fibrosis. This may be
repeated annually or more frequently, as indicated.
Grade A
2. US examination of the liver should be performed in
patients with T2DM and elevated serum ALT and/or
AST to diagnose fatty liver and to exclude focal liver
lesion.
Grade A
3. Patients with persistently elevated serum ALT and/
or AST level should be investigated to exclude other
causes of chronic liver disease.
Grade A
4. Patients with indeterminate or high serum
biomarkers of fibrosis should be referred for liver
stiffness measurement.
Grade A
5. Patients with persistently elevated serum ALT
and/or AST level or elevated liver stiffness
measurement should be considered for referral
to Gastroenterologist/Hepatologist for further
evaluation and management.
Grade A
6. A liver biopsy may be considered for definitive
diagnosis of NASH and/or advanced liver fibrosis.
Grade A
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Treatment
• The mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is lifestyle intervention.455 (Level II-2)
› A balanced, reduced calorie, individually tailored diet (for overweight/
obese persons with T2DM) to enable weight loss which includes limiting
excess fructose consumption such as avoiding beverages with added
fructose and foods with high fructose corn syrup, choosing complex CHO,
high fibre foods and avoiding processed foods.456 (Level II-2)
- A study on biopsy-proven NASH patients found that weight loss of ≥10%
through lifestyle intervention over 52 weeks resulted in NASH resolution
and fibrosis improvement in 90% and 45% of patients, respectively.455 (Level II-2)
› Avoid excessive alcohol consumption (refer above).457 (Level II-2)
› Moderate-intensity exercise ≥30 minutes/day for ≥5 days/week or a total
of ≥150 minutes/week, or vigorous-intensity exercise for ≥20 minutes/day
for ≥3 days/week or a total of ≥75 minutes/week (any new activity should
be started slowly and, its intensity and duration gradually increased).458 (Level I)
› Smoking cessation to reduce CVD risk.459 (Level II-1)
• GLP1-RA has been shown to be associated with significantly greater NASH
resolution and lesser fibrosis progression in a randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial.460 (Level I)
• SGLT2-i has been shown to significantly reduce liver fat based on magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-proton density fat fraction (a MRI-based technique
for measurement of liver fat) and serum ALT level in a RCT,461 (Level I) and may
be useful for the treatment of NASH based on a pilot study using paired liver
biopsy.462 (Level II-2)
• Pioglitazone has been shown to significantly reduce steatosis, lobular
inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning in biopsy-proven NASH patients,463
(Level I) but its use has been associated with significant weight gain that
persisted after discontinuation of therapy. There are also continued concerns
about risk of CCF, osteoporosis and bladder cancer.
• Vitamin E has been shown to significantly reduce steatosis, lobular
inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning in biopsy-proven NASH patients
without T2DM,463 (Level I) but its use has been associated with concerns about
risk of prostate cancer and increased all-cause mortality.
› In a study of biopsy-proven NASH patients with T2DM, vitamin E did not
achieve the primary endpoint of 2-point reduction in the NAFLD activity
score from 2 different parameters, but did result in significantly greater
NASH resolution compared with placebo.464 (Level I)
SECTION 3
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
• CVD is the leading cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD. NAFLD
and CVD share common risk factors.465 (Level II-3) Meta-analyses466,467 (Level II-3)
performed demonstrate an association between NAFLD and increased CVD
events, especially for those with severe NAFLD or NASH.
› Risk factors for CVD should be evaluated and managed accordingly to
reduce the risk of CVD.
› Statins reduce the risk of CVD in patients with dyslipidaemia but is under
prescribed among patients with NAFLD.
- In a study on 428 NAFLD patients, 74.1% of patients who should have
been receiving statin therapy were not while 58.9% of patients who
were on statins did not achieve the treatment LDL-C target.468 (Level II-2)
- Serious liver injury from statins is rare and it is safe to be prescribed for
most NAFLD patients.
Recommendations: Treatment of NAFLD
1. Lifestyle intervention is the mainstay of treatment of
NAFLD.
Grade A
2. Statins should be prescribed for treatment of
dyslipidaemia in NAFLD patients, when indicated, to
reduce the risk of CVD.
Grade A
3. GLP1-RA and/or SGLT2-i should be considered for
the treatment of T2DM in patients with suspected or
confirmed NASH and/or advanced liver fibrosis.
Grade B
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
› Weight-based fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) is the
current standard recommendation and the use of ‘sliding scale’
insulin should no longer be practised.
• Euglycaemic ketoacidosis
› Although this has been known in T1DM, it can occur in patients
with T2DM treated with SGLT2-i, precipitated by stress, and/or
omission of insulin.
› Awareness, prompt recognition, timely diagnosis and management
is required.

Adapted from Agiostratidou et al. Diab Care 2017.469(Level III)
• Risk factors for hypoglycaemia include:
› advancing age,
› severe cognitive impairment,
› poor health knowledge,
› uncontrolled T2DM with glucose variability,958
› hypoglycaemia unawareness,959
› long duration of insulin therapy,959
› renal and hepatic impairment,
› peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.960
• Strategies for prevention of hypoglycaemia:
› identifying patients at risk,
› education on recognising symptoms of hypoglycaemia,
› structured educational and psycho-behavioural programs (e.g. Blood
glucose awareness training) that may help to improve detection of
hypoglycaemia and reduce the frequency of severe episodes.470,471 (Level I)
• Patients at risk of hypoglycaemia should be discouraged from driving motorvehicles, cycling, swimming or operating heavy machinery, as these activities
may endanger oneself and the public.
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
Treatment of hypoglycaemia
• The aims of treatment are to:
› detect and treat a low plasma glucose level promptly,
› eliminate the risk of injury to oneself and to relieve symptoms quickly; and
› avoid over-correction of hypoglycaemia especially in repeated cases as this
will lead to poor glycaemic control and weight gain.40 (Level III)
• In Level I and Level 2 hypoglycaemia the patient should ingest:472,473 (Level II-3)
6,40,474 (Level III)
› 15 g of simple CHO e.g.
- 1 tablespoon of honey,
- 150-200 ml of fruit juice such as orange juice or regular soft drink; or
- 3 teaspoons of table sugar dissolved in water.
› Measure plasma glucose after 15 minutes.
› If the level at 15 minutes is still <3.9 mmol/L, another 15 g of CHO should
be taken.
› People taking AGIs (acarbose) must use glucose (dextrose) tablets or, if
unavailable, milk or honey to treat the hypoglycaemia.
• In Level 3 hypoglycaemia,6,40,474 (Level III)
› where the individual is still conscious, administer 20 g of CHO and the
above steps are repeated.
› where the individual is unconscious, administer:
- 20-50 ml of Dextrose (D) 50% intravenously (IV) over 1-3 minutes, or
- 75-100 ml of D20% over 15 minutes, or
- 1 mg glucagon subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM).
- Outside the hospital setting, a tablespoon of honey (or equivalent e.g.
maple syrup) should be administered into the oral cavity.
• Once hypoglycaemia has been reversed, the patient should have the usual
meal or snack that is due at that time of the day to prevent recurrent
hypoglycaemia.
• Evaluate cause of the hypoglycaemia and educate patient on how to prevent
future episodes.
• Diabetes treatment (OGLDs and insulin) regime may need to be reviewed
and adjusted.

Hypoglycaemia unawareness
• Hypoglycaemia unawareness occurs when the ability to perceive the
autonomic warning symptoms is either diminished or lost such that the first
sign of hypoglycaemia is confusion or loss of consciousness.40 (Level III)
• Recent or recurrent hypoglycaemia can decrease normal responses to
hypoglycaemia476 (Level II-2) and lead to defective glucose counter-regulation
and hypoglycaemia unawareness.
• Hypoglycaemia unawareness increases the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia
and therefore should trigger re-evaluation of the treatment regimen.477 (Level III)
• Both hypoglycaemia unawareness and defective glucose counter-regulation
are potentially reversible.
• Patients should be advised to temporarily relax their targets.
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
• Strict avoidance of hypoglycaemia for up to 3 months has been associated
with improvement in the recognition of severe hypoglycaemia, the counterregulatory hormone responses or both.40 (Level III) 478-483 (Level II-2)
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia
• Risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia is higher especially in the elderly.334 (Level II-3)
• The clinical manifestations may include:40 (Level III) 484,485 (Level II-2)
› poor sleep quality,
› vivid dreams or nightmares,
› waking up with chills or sweating,
› morning headache,
› chronic fatigue,
› mood changes,
› nocturnal convulsions.
• Nocturnal hypoglycaemia may contribute to morning hyperglycaemia.
• Undetected nocturnal hypoglycaemia can promote:
› hypoglycaemia unawareness,
› blunt counterregulatory responses,
› anxiety, reduce quality of life and increase treatment costs.486 (Level II-3)
› negative outcomes such as falls, accidents and arrhythmias.
• To reduce the risk of asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia, individuals
on basal insulin therapy should periodically monitor early morning (2-5 am,
corresponding with the peak action time of the basal insulin) plasma glucose
levels.40 (Level III)
› Consider switching from human basal insulin to basal insulin analogues
• Patients on SU should readjust dose/consider switching to an OGLD without
hypoglycaemia risk.
Complications of hypoglycaemia
• Hypoglycaemia can cause acute harm to the person with T2DM or others,
especially if it causes falls, motor vehicle accidents, or other accidents.
• A large cohort study suggested that among older adults with T2DM, a history
of severe hypoglycaemia was associated with greater risk of dementia.487 (Level II-3)
• Severe hypoglycaemia was associated with excess mortality in participants
in both the standard and the intensive glycaemia arms of the ACCORD, VADT
and ADVANCE trials.488-491 (Level I)
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
• In people with T2DM and established or very high risk for CVD, there is a clear
association between severe hypoglycaemia and increased mortality.492,493 (Level I)
494(Level II-3)
• Acute hypoglycaemia is proinflammatory, increases platelet activation and
decreases fibrinolysis, leading to a prothrombotic state.495,496 (Level II-2)
• Hypoglycaemia is associated with increased heart rate, SBP, myocardial
contractility, stroke volume and cardiac output, and can induce ST- and
T-wave changes with a lengthening of the QT interval (slower repolarization),
which may increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.497-499
(Level II-2) 500 (Level II-3) 501 (Level III)
Recommendations: Hypoglycaemia
1. Patients at risk of hypoglycaemia or with high CV
risk should be educated to recognise and prevent
hypoglycaemia.
Grade C
2. Patients on insulin/insulin secretagogues therapy
should periodically monitor early morning glucose to
detect nocturnal hypoglycaemia.
Grade C
3. Patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness and those
with concomitant CVD should relax their glycaemic
targets.
Grade C
4. Hypoglycaemia unawareness should trigger reevaluation of the treatment regimen.
Grade C
5. Patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness should
avoid hypoglycaemia for up to 3 months to regain
early hypoglycaemia warning symptoms.

SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
4.2 Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is among the most serious acute complications
of T2DM.502
• It has a high mortality rate if unrecognised. The overall mortality is <1%, but
a mortality rate >5% in the elderly has been reported.502
• Mortality in patients with DKA is frequently related to the underlying
aetiological precipitant rather than the metabolic sequelae of hyperglycaemia
or ketoacidosis.502
Principles of management
• Correction of dehydration
• Correction of electrolyte imbalance
• Insulin therapy
• Treatment of precipitating factor
• Prevention of complications
Assessment
• Initial assessment
› History and physical examination
- Look for precipitating causes: infection, missed therapy, non-adherence,
acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, surgery and drugs
(e.g. steroids).
› Investigations
- Capillary and venous plasma glucose
- Venous blood gas (pH, bicarbonate)
- Blood or urinary ketones
- BUSE and creatinine
- FBC
- Urinalysis
- If indicated: blood cultures, CXR and ECG
• Diagnostic criteria
› All 3 criteria must be met503 (Level III)
- Capillary plasma glucose >11 mmol/L
- Capillary ketones >3 mmol/L or urine ketones ≥2+
- Venous pH <7.3 and/or bicarbonate <15 mmol/L
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
› Patients with high risk for DKA or severe DKA should be admitted to HDU
or the ICU. High-risk factors include:
- elderly
- pregnancy
- heart and kidney failure
- other serious co-morbidities
• Clinical parameters for severe DKA
› Venous bicarbonate <5 mmol/L
› Plasma ketones >6 mmol/L
› Venous pH <7.1
› Hypokalaemia on admission (<3.5 mmol/L)
› GCS <12
› Oxygen saturation <92% on air (via arterial blood gases [ABG])
› Systolic BP <90 mmHg
› Pulse >100 beats/minute
› Anion gap >16 (Anion gap = [Na+ + K+] – [Cl- + HCO3
-])*
* Na+: sodium; K+: potassium; Cl- : chloride; HCO3- : bicarbonate
Treatment
• Aims of treatment
› Rate of fall of ketones of at least 0.5 mmol/L/hr, OR
› Bicarbonate rise of 3 mmol/L/hr, AND
› Plasma glucose fall of at least 3 mmol/L/hr, AND
› Maintain serum potassium within normal range.
• Precaution during treatment
› Avoid over-correction of hyperglycaemia (within the first 12-24 hours of
treatment, avoid lowering glucose to <14.0 mmol/L)
A. Immediate treatment
• Correction of dehydration
› Fluid deficits in DKA may be up to 10% of total body weight. Restoration of
circulating volume is a priority.502
› SBP on admission <90 mmHg (likely due to low circulating volume,
but consider other causes such as heart failure or sepsis).503 (Level III) Start
administration of fluid as shown in Table 4-3.

Addition of potassium is likely to be required in the second litre of fluid, especially if baseline potassium is
<5 mmol/L, and aim to maintain levels between 4-5 mmol/L.
› SBP on admission is ≥90 mmHg,503 (Level III) start administration of fluid as
shown in Table 4-4.

› The rate of hydration should be guided by:
- haemodynamic status,
- state of hydration,
- serum electrolyte levels; and
- urinary output.
› More cautious fluid replacement in:**
- young people <18 years
- elderly
- pregnancy
- existing heart or renal failure
** In the above instances, consider HDU admission and, insertion and monitoring via central line.
• Potassium replacement
› Aim to maintain serum potassium between 4-5 mmol/L.
› Withhold K+ replacement if there is no urine output.

• Insulin
› Start a fixed rate IV insulin infusion (FRIII): 0.1 unit/kg/hr based on estimate
of weight.503 (Level III)
› 50 units short-acting human insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue504 (Level
II-2) made up to 50 ml with 0.9% saline solution.
› Delay insulin infusion if the initial potassium <3.5 mmol/L until serum
potassium is corrected.
› Basal insulin – may consider continuing patient’s SC long-acting analogue/
human insulin while on IV insulin infusion.505,506 (Level II-1)
› Monitor capillary glucose hourly – if the glucose does not fall by at least 3
mmol/L/hr in the first 2-3 hours despite adequate hydration, increase FRIII
by 1 U/hr.
› Once plasma glucose falls below 14 mmol/L: 503(Level III)
- add or switch to 5% dextrose and reduce insulin infusion rate by 50%,
- in the presence of persistent ketonaemia, consider maintaining insulin
infusion rate and changing to 10% dextrose.
› Beyond 24 hours, maintain plasma glucose at 8-12 mmol/L.503 (Level III)
• IV bicarbonate
› The use of IV HCO3
- is not indicated to correct acidosis in DKA due to:
- rise of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) which may lead to a paradoxical increase in CSF acidosis,
- delay in the fall of plasma lactate and ketone level; and
- risk of cerebral oedema especially in younger age group.
› While evidence is lacking, IV HCO3
- may be considered if pH is persistently
<6.9 despite adequate hydration and insulin treatment.502 (Level III)
- E.g. 1 ampoule (50 ml) 8.4% NaHCO3 added to 200 ml D5% over 1 hr,
repeated every 1-2 hours, until pH is ≥7.0.502 (Level III) Each ml of 8.4%
NaHCO3 solution contains 84.0 mg NaHCO3 (e.g. 1.0 mmol/ml).
• Phosphate
› No evidence to support routine phosphate replacement for DKA.502 (Level III)
› If levels <0.32 mmol/L in the presence of cardiac dysfunction or respiratory
depression, consider phosphate replacement.
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
B. Monitoring
• Hourly capillary plasma glucose until it reaches maintenance level of 8 mmol/L-
12 mmol/L, then monitor 2-4 hourly.
• Vital signs and input-output charting hourly
• Venous HCO3
- and K+ at 60 minutes, 4 hours and 6-hourly thereafter
• 6-hourly BUSE and blood/urine ketones
• If ketones and glucose are not falling as expected, check if the insulin infusion
pump is working and connected, and the correct insulin residual volume is
present.
• If equipment is working but response to treatment inadequate, increase
insulin infusion rate by 1 U/hr increments hourly until targets are achieved.
C. Resolution
• Continue IV insulin infusion until resolution of DKA
• Resolution is defined as:505 (Level III)
› pH >7.3
› Plasma ketone <0.6 mmol/L
D. Transitioning from IV insulin to SC basal bolus insulin
• Patient should be eating and drinking, and back on normal insulin.505 (Level III)
• Overlap the SC insulin with the insulin infusion for ½ hour (for insulin
analogues) or 1 hour (for human insulin).
• Calculating a basal bolus regimen (4 times daily)503 (Level III)
› Current practice is shifting away from estimating total daily dose (TDD) of
SC insulin based on the last 12-24-hour-insulin administered.507 (Level III)
› Estimate total daily dose (TDD) of insulin by multiplying the patient’s
weight (in kg) by 0.5 U-0.75 U.
› Use 0.75 U/kg for those considered to be more insulin resistant e.g. obese
and/or presence of acanthosis nigricans.
› Give 50% of TDD at bedtime in the form of long acting insulin and divide
remaining dose equally between pre-breakfast, pre-lunch and pre-dinner
meals.
• For patients already on insulin before admission, consider resuming previous
insulin regimen and adjust dose as needed.
• Monitor and adjust insulin doses accordingly.

4.3 Euglycaemic ketoacidosis
• Approximately 10% of patients with DKA present with near-normal glycaemic
values.509
• The current definition for euglycaemic ketoacidosis is plasma glucose level
<11.0 mmol/L.510,511 (Level III)
• Euglycaemic ketoacidosis has been described in T1DM509 and in pregnancy.512,513
• Recently there has been an increasing number of cases of euglycaemic
ketoacidosis associated with the use of SGLT2-i for treatment of T2DM.514 (Level II-2)
› Hence, a normal or mildly elevated plasma glucose does not rule out DKA
in pregnancy or with SGLT2 inhibitor use.
› The documented precipitating factors in patients on SGLT2-i include
acute illnesses (such as infection), recent major surgery and insulin dose
reduction or omission.515 (Level I) 516 (Level II-2)
• Clinical presentation is similar to ketoacidosis. Although the definition states
that random plasma glucose is <11.0 mmol/L, most patients’ plasma glucose
are elevated to >11.0 mmol/L but, lower than levels associated with DKA
(~15 mmol/L-17 mmol/L).
› A high index of suspicion is required for its timely diagnosis because of the
absence of very high glucose levels as seen classically in patients with DKA.
› When patients present (whether at outpatient clinics/emergency wards or
as in-patients),
- where there has been poor oral intake/prolonged fasting e.g. during
Ramadan/have an acute illness/are post-operative,
- check for a history of taking SGLT2-i,
- make it a routine to check for ketones (urine/blood) and if necessary,
blood gas and anion gap – to prevent delay in making a timely diagnosis
and institute appropriate emergency management.
• Treatment should follow standard DKA management protocol except
dehydration is corrected with 5% dextrose saline or 5% dextrose.509 (Level III)
› When the plasma glucose is low in the absence of clinical dehydration, 10%
dextrose may be required.
• SGLT2-i should be withheld and restarted when ketoacidosis resolves and
patient is tolerating oral food intake. 511 (Level III)
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
4.4 Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS)
• Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is a life-threatening emergency
and should be suspected in patients with T2DM who are very ill with
significant hyperglycaemia.
• Can be an initial presentation of undiagnosed T2DM (7-17%).
• Diagnosis of HHS must be prompt and managed intensively in HDU or
equivalent level of care.517 (Level III)
• The elderly with multiple co-morbidities are prone to HHS.518,519 (Level II-3)
• It has a higher mortality than DKA and vascular complications such as MI,
stroke or peripheral arterial thrombosis are common.518-521 (Level II-3)
› Well-described complications such as seizures, cerebral oedema and
osmotic demyelination syndrome though uncommon522 (Level III) can occur
due to rapid changes in osmolality during treatment.523 (Level III)
• Whilst the presentation of DKA is rapid (within hours), HHS progresses over
many days. As a result, the dehydration and metabolic disturbances are
more profound.524 (Level III)
Diagnostic criteria517 (Level III)
• Severe dehydration
• Marked hyperglycaemia (plasma glucose >30 mmol/L)
• Serum osmolality >320 mosmol/kg
› Effective serum osmolality = 2 (Na2+) [mmol/L] + glucose [mmol/L]
› In severe hyperglycaemia, measured serum Na2+ is falsely low i.e.
pseudohyponatremia. Recognition of pseudohyponatraemia is important
to avoid use of hypertonic saline during fluid management.
› Urea levels are not used for calculation of osmolality, as it passes freely
across the plasma membranes and its accumulation does not induce an
osmotic gradient across cell membranes.525
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
Other important clinical features517 (Level III)
• There is no significant ketonaemia (<3.0 mmol/L) or acidosis (pH >7.3, HCO3
-
>15 mmol/L).
• When significant acidosis is present, a mixed picture of HHS and DKA should
be considered. However, other causes of acidosis (such as lactic acidosis,
sepsis and poisoning) should be excluded.
• If there is worsening of acute cognitive impairment, consider:
› cerebral oedema in severe cases or the presence of significant electrolyte
disturbances,
› hyperosmolality (>330 mosmol/kg),
› sudden drop in osmolality,
› severe dehydration, infection and sepsis,
› hypoglycaemia during treatment; and
› renal failure.
• Precipitating factors for HHS526,527 (Level III)
› Infection (30-60%)
› Poor adherence to treatment – omission of insulin or OGLDs
› Presence of acute concomitant illness – cerebrovascular events, myocardial
infarction
› Medication – diuretics, glucocorticoids or antipsychotic drugs
Management goals
• The treatment goals of HHS are to treat the underlying cause as well as
gradual and safe:
› correction of dehydration,
› correction of electrolyte imbalance,
› control of hyperglycaemia,
› treatment of precipitating factors,
› prevention of complications.
Principles of treatment
• IV 0.9% saline solution is the principle fluid to restore circulating volume and
correction of dehydration.
• IV 0.45% saline solution is used if serum Na2+ is >145 mmol/L or the serum
osmolality is not declining (<3 mosm/kg) despite adequate hydration.
SECTION 4
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
• Recognition of pseudohyponatraemia in severe hyperglycaemia is important
as to avoid using hypertonic saline.
• Most algorithms6,40 recommend use of corrected Na2+ after restoring
circulatory volume, however, in general use of measured Na2+ is acceptable
to guide decision on fluid management.
• In the presence of heart failure and renal failure, cautious fluid replacement
is advised.
• Aim for gradual reduction in serum osmolality at the rate of 3-8 mosm/kg/hr.
• An initial rise in Na2+ is expected and is not in itself an indication for hypotonic
fluids. Thereafter, the rate of fall of plasma Na2+ should not exceed 10 mmol/L
in 24 hours.
• Too rapid fall in glucose should be avoided.
› Aim for a reduction in blood glucose of 4-6 mmol/L/hr.505 (Level III)
• Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended unless
contraindicated.
• Identify and treat the precipitating cause.
• Resolution of HHS is when the patient is alert, eating well, serum osmolality
<320 mosm/kg and plasma glucose level <14 mmol/L.502,527 (Level III)
• Once HHS resolves, transition from IV insulin to SC basal bolus insulin.
However, patients with HHS are more insulin sensitive and may require lower
insulin dose.
• To reduce the risk of recurrence and prevent long-term complications,
discharge planning should include:
› diabetes education,
› dietitian referral,
› education on medications including insulin administration, if required.

MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC
COMPLICATIONS
SECTION 5
5.1 Retinopathy
• Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is closely linked to duration of diabetes
and level of glycaemic control.528 (Level II-2) 529 (Level I)
• Other factors that increase risk of retinopathy include hypertension and
nephropathy.530 (Level II-3) 531 (Level II-2)
• At diagnosis, less than 5% will have retinopathy while the prevalence rises to
40-50% after 10 years. About 60% patients with T2DM have some degree of
retinopathy after 20 years of the disease.532 (Level III)
• Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among adults in
developed countries.
› In Malaysia, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy from the 2007 Diabetes
Eye Registry was 36.8%.533 (Level III)
› More recently, a prevalence of retinopathy in ambulatory outpatients with
T2DM of 15% and 39.3% was found in Klang Valley and Kelantan tertiary
care centres respectively.534,535
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy has
emerged as the treatment of choice in centre-involving diabetic
macular oedema, shown to be superior to laser photocoagulation in
improving vision.
• Rapid improvement of glycaemia in patients with established
retinopathy may be associated with transient worsening of
retinopathy. Co-management with an ophthalmologist and a more
gradual improvement of glycaemia is advised.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
Screening
• Screening and early treatment can prevent substantial visual loss in many
cases.536 (Level II-3) 537 (Level II-2)
• Screening should include:
› visual acuity assessment using Snellen or equivalent chart with pinhole
correction,
› a non-mydriatic fundus camera photography as a part of a telemedicine
program with remote review by credentialled personnel.538,539 (Level III)
• In general, eye examinations are repeated every 1-2 years in those with
minimal-to-no retinopathy.536 (Level II-3) 537 (Level II-2)
Eye examination
• Ideally at the time of diagnosis of T2DM and preferably performed by an
ophthalmologist.540 (Level I)
• Should include:
› visual acuity assessment using Snellen or equivalent chart with pinhole
correction, and
› complete anterior segment and dilated fundus examination.
In low-/intermediate resource settings, screening should include visual acuity
assessment and retinal examination for adequate Diabetic Retinopathy
Classification by trained/credentialled personnel.538 (Level III)
Management
A. Delay onset and progression
• Glucose
› Intensive glucose-lowering has been shown to prevent and/or delay onset
and progression of retinopathy in T2DM.401, 541,542 (Level I)
› In situations where rapid control of glucose is expected in patients with preexisting diabetic retinopathy there is a potential for transient worsening
of retinopathy hence, referral for detailed ophthalmological assessment is
required.259,260,543 (Level I) 544-546 (Level II)
- If diabetic retinopathy is documented, care should be taken when
improving glycaemic control and patients need to be counselled regarding
the likelihood of transient worsening of retinopathy.
• Blood pressure
› Lowering blood pressure (BP) decreases retinopathy progression,
although lowering BP intensively (systolic BP <120 mmHg) does not impart
additional benefit.401,547,548 (Level I)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Fenofibrate use
› Retinopathy progression may be slowed by addition of fenofibrate
particularly
in
those
with
non-proliferative
diabetic
retinopathy
(NPDR).400,401 (Level I)
› This holds true irrespective of baseline dyslipidaemia status.
• Aspirin use
› The presence of retinopathy is not a contraindication to aspirin therapy for
cardiovascular disease prevention, as this therapy does not increase the
risk of retinal bleeding.549 (Level I)
B. Treatment
• Photocoagulation therapy
› Laser photocoagulation remains the standard practice for treating diabetic
retinopathy. Laser therapy is indicated for severe NPDR and proliferative
diabetic retinopathy.550 (Level I)
› Laser therapy is only relatively indicated in certain types of diabetic
macular oedema.551 (Level III)
• Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
› Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in
diabetic retinopathy, particularly in the development of diabetic macular
oedema.
› Anti-VEGF therapy is superior to laser photocoagulation,552 (Level I) improves
vision and is the treatment of choice in centre-involving diabetic macular
oedema.553 (Level I)
› Potential adverse effects of anti-VEGFs include transient increases in
intraocular pressure and injection-related infectious endophthalmitis.554 (Level I)
› Non-ocular adverse events reported include cerebrovascular accidents and
MI. However systematic reviews have not found a statistically significant
association.552 (Level I)
Referral to ophthalmologist
• Referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary for the following situations
(Refer Table 5-1):
› severe NPDR,
› any level of diabetic maculopathy,
› any proliferative diabetic retinopathy,
› unexplained visual loss,
› if screening examination cannot be performed, or ungradeable fundus
photo is used.

Recommendations: Retinopathy
1. Improving glycaemic control and optimising BP
reduces risk of development and progression of
retinopathy.
Grade A
5. Pan-retinal laser photocoagulation is indicated to
reduce visual loss in high risk proliferative diabetic
retinopathy and in some cases, severe nonproliferative retinopathy.
Grade A
2. In T2DM, screening and evaluation for retinopathy is
indicated at the time of diagnosis.
Grade B
3. The interval for follow-up assessment should be
decided based on severity of retinopathy.

interval is 1-2 years.
6. Intra-vitreal anti-VEGF is indicated for sight-threatening
centre-involving diabetic macular oedema.
Grade B
Grade A
5.2 Diabetic kidney disease (DKD)
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• DKD is the new term used to refer to kidney disease caused by T2DM.
• SGLT2-i have been proven to be renoprotective, beyond glucoselowering.
• SGLT2-i should be considered in patients with albuminuria and DKD
down to eGFR 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, to reduce DKD progression.
• GLP1-RA have been shown to reduce albuminuria progression in
DKD with high CV risk.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• DKD is a major cause of chronic kidney disease and may be present at
diagnosis of T2DM, and can progress to ESKD.555 (Level II-3)
• It accounted for 65% of new patients requiring dialysis in Malaysia in 2016.5
(Level II-3)
• DKD markedly increases CV risk and healthcare costs.556 (Level I) 557 (Level II-2)
• Diagnosis is made clinically – based on presence of albuminuria and/or reduced
eGFR in the absence of other causes of kidney disease.558 (Level III) If there is
concomitant presence of other microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy),
it is more suggestive that the albuminuria/reduced eGFR is due to DKD.
• Progression to ESKD requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) occurs in
many with poorly controlled BP and glucose.
Screening and risk stratification
• Screening should encompass:
› assessment of albuminuria,
› estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
• DKD can be present with or without albuminuria, in the presence or absence
of retinopathy.559,560 (Level II-2)

SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• A standard urine dipstick test should be performed at diagnosis of T2DM and
annually.561 (Level III)
• A positive dipstick test should be confirmed on two occasions within 3 months.
• Albuminuria should be quantified, if present.
• If dipstick is negative, screen for urine microalbuminuria (first morning
sample or a random sample without excessive water intake).561 (Level III) If
microalbuminuria is negative, test yearly.
• Moderately increased albuminuria (previously known as microalbuminuria) is
the earliest sign of DKD and predicts increased CV mortality and morbidity
and ESKD.556 (Level I)
• If albuminuria is detected, repeat the test twice in 3-6 months for
confirmation561 (Level III) after excluding other causes such as UTI and CCF. If 2
out of 3 tests are positive, a diagnosis of DKD is established.
• Albuminuria may be affected by variation in urine concentration due to
hydration.
• If microalbuminuria dipstick is positive, it is recommended to do a more
specific test urine albumin- creatinine ratio (UACR). The UACR is not affected
by urine concentration and should be done early morning to minimise effect
of posture and exercise.562 (Level III)
• UACR >3.0 mg/mmol is equivalent to >30 mg protein excretion/24 hours and
should be monitored at least twice yearly (Refer Table 5-3 for stratifying
albuminuria status according to ACR/AER).

B. Estimation of GFR
• Measure serum creatinine at least annually regardless of degree of albumin
excretion.563 (Level III)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Renal function should be assessed using estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) based on the 2009 CKD-epidemiology (CKD-EPI) creatinine
equation.563 (Level III) A Malaysian study showed that the CKD-EPI creatinine
equation was more accurate than MDRD in patients with eGFR <60 ml/
min/1.73 m2, using Cr-51-EDTA as a reference.564 (Level II-2)
• An eGFR <60 ml/min / 1.73m2 is considered abnormal and should be repeated
after 3 months to diagnose DKD. However, eGFR thresholds may vary in older
adults565,566 (Level III) and should be interpreted with caution in elderly individuals
>70 years.
› When eGFR <60ml/min /1.73m2, screening for complications such as
volume overload, electrolyte abnormality, metabolic acidosis, anaemia and
renal bone disease should be considered.
• Ultrasound KUB is indicated in patients with rapid decline in GFR and if there
is suspicion of obstructive uropathy.561 (Level III)
Both eGFR and albuminuria should be quantified for risk stratification and to
guide management (Refer Table 5-4).561,563,565 (Level III)

MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
Management
A. General management
• Preventing progression of DKD encompasses:
› BP control,
› glycaemic control,
› RAS blockade,24,373,567-569 (Level I) 355 (Level III)
› SGLT2 inhibition.201,202,209,589,955 (Level I)
• Dose adjustments of GLDs may be necessary with eGFR <60ml/min/1.73 m2.
(Refer Appendix 7)
• BP control
› BP targets
- BP target in DKD should be <130/80 mmHg regardless of level of
albuminuria.561 (Level III) 570 (Level II-1) 571 (Level II-2)
- SBP should not be <120 mmHg and DBP not <70 mmHg.
Recommendations: Screening for DKD
2. Screening for albuminuria should be performed at
diagnosis and annually with a conventional dipstick on
an early morning urine specimen.
Grade C
6. Regardless of the degree of albuminuria, serum
creatinine level should be measured annually to
determine GFR based on the CKD EPI formula.
Grade C
1. DKD should be assessed, risk stratified and managed
based on degree of albuminuria and eGFR.
Grade C
3. If urine dipstick for albuminuria is negative, screening
for microalbuminuria should be performed.
Grade C
4. If microalbuminuria is detected, confirmation should
be made with a repeat test within 3 to 6 months.
Grade C
5. If microalbuminuria is not detected, re-screening should
be performed annually.

SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
› ACE inhibitors/ARB
- ACE inhibitor or ARB is the preferred first-line agent for BP in DKD
with proven benefit on prevention of DKD progression, via their antiproteinuric effects.372,373,572 (Level I)
- ACE inhibitor or ARB is beneficial in DKD with albuminuria even when BP
is <130/80 mmHg.371,373,561,573-576 (Level I)
- Normalisation of microalbuminuria is associated with a reduction in the
rate of decline of GFR.371 (Level I)
- Urine protein-creatinine ratio (uPCr) or UACR should be used to monitor
treatment response directed against proteinuria. uPCR is preferred in
those with established proteinuria in view of its cost-effectiveness.577 (Level III)
- ACE inhibitor and ARB are similar in terms of benefits and risks.370 (Level I) 578
(Level II-2)
- Renal profile should be reassessed within 2-4 weeks upon initiation or
dose escalation of ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy, especially in patients with
impaired renal function at baseline.
- Consider reducing dose or discontinuing ACE inhibitor/ARB within 2
months upon commencement (after excluding other precipitating factors)
when:561 (Level III)
» serum creatinine levels remain ≥30% from the baseline; or
» eGFR reduces ≥25%; or
» serum potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L.
- ACE inhibitor/ARB should be titrated to the maximum recommended
dose to achieve optimal BP targets and anti-proteinuric effects.561 (Level III)
- The benefits and risks of withholding RAS blockers in advanced DKD are
debatable. There is an ongoing trial to assess this.579 (Level I)
- Combination of ACE inhibitor with ARB should not be used routinely.
This combination showed no added benefit but had higher adverse
effects such as hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury.580 (Level I) 581 (Level II-1)
› Mineralocorticoid antagonist
- Finerenone, a selective mineralocorticoid antagonist has recently been
shown to reduce DKD progression and CV events in DKD.954 (Level I)
- Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone
and finerenone) in combination with ACE inhibitor/ARB are effective for
management of resistant hypertension and have been shown to reduce
albuminuria in short-term studies of DKD, and may have additional CV
benefits.582 (Level I) 583 (Level II-2) 584 (Level II-1) 585 (Level III)
- Careful monitoring for hyperkalaemia is required when used in
combination with ACE inhibitor/ARB.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Glucose lowering
› Metformin
- Metformin remains the first-line glucose-lowering therapy in DKD, unless
eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2.586 (Level I)
- Dose reduction of metformin by 50% is required between eGFR 30-44 ml/
min/1.73m2.956 (Level III)
- For patients with an eGFR between 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, full dose can
be continued but dose reduction may need to be considered in patients
who are predisposed to hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.956 (Level III)
› SGLT2-i
- SGLT2-i reduce intraglomerular pressure, albuminuria and slow GFR
decline independent of their glucose and BP lowering effects.587 (Level III) 588
(Level I)
- SGLT2-i reduce the rate of DKD progression in patients up to eGFR 3025 ml/min/1.73 m2 201,202,209,589,955(Level I) despite lower anti-hyperglycaemic
efficacy.
- Do not initiate at eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 – but, may continue if already
initiated.209,955 (Level I), 956 (Level III) The eGFR levels at which SGLT2-i can be
initiated and stopped are likely to be subject to change as new evidence/
data become available.
- Stop SGLT2-i when patient is initiated on dialysis.956 (Level III)
- Patients with higher degree of albuminuria and advanced DKD benefitted
the most.209 (Level I)
› GLP1-RA
- GLP-1RA can be considered in patients with DKD and high CV risk in
order to reduce albuminuria progression.230,259,590 (Level I)
- Dedicated renal outcome trials with GLP1-RA are ongoing.591
• Protein and salt intake
› Maintain dietary protein at 0.8g/kg body weight/day956 (Level III) in DKD stage
3-5 (not on dialysis) while ensuring adequate energy intake (30-35 kcal/kg/
day).558,561,592 (Level III) 593 (Level I)
› Control of dietary potassium is important in those who are at risk of
hyperkalaemia.594 (Level III)
› Salt restriction to <2 g/day (sodium chloride <5 g/day)956(Level III) is recommended
to control BP and reduce CV risk.595 (Level II-1)
B. Other measures
• Lipid control (Refer Sub-section 3.9.2)
• Smoking cessation
• Weight reduction (Refer Sub-section 3.9.3)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
Recommendations: Management of DKD
2. BP target should be ≤130/80 mmHg (SBP not <120
mmHg and DBP not <70 mmHg) in DKD regardless of
level of albuminuria.
Grade A
1. Optimise glucose and blood pressure control and use
RAS blockade to slow progression of DKD.
Grade A
3. ACEIs or ARBs should be initiated in patients with
albuminuria, regardless of BP, as tolerated.
Grade A
5. GLP1-RA should be considered in patients with DKD
and at high CV risk.
Grade A
Referral to nephrologist
All patients with T2DM and DKD should be referred to a nephrologist in these
situations:561,565 (Level III)
• rapid decline in renal function (eGFR loss >5 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 1 year or >10
ml/min/1.73 m2 in 5 years),
• eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2,
• persistent heavy proteinuria (≥1 g/day) despite optimal treatment,
• persistent haematuria with albuminuria (urine protein ≥0.5 g/day),
• other suspected causes apart from DKD (glomerular, genetic or uncertain
cause),
• difficult to manage complications of DKD (anaemia, electrolyte disturbance
including persistent hyperkalaemia, renal bone disease),
• resistant hypertension (failure to control BP despite 3 anti-hypertensive
agents, including a diuretic),
4. SGLT2-i should be considered in patients with
eGFR ≥30ml/min /1.73m2, particularly in those with
albuminuria to reduce risk of DKD progression.
Grade A
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• suspected renal artery stenosis,
• pregnant or planning for pregnancy.
Consultation with a nephrologist at eGFR <30ml/ min/1.73m2 has been shown
to delay dialysis, improve quality of care and reduce cost.596 (Level III) The reason
for limiting referral to this eGFR is for purely logistical concerns. It is important
for primary care and general physicians to jointly manage patients with
nephrologists.
5.3 Neuropathy
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• CV autonomic neuropathy is an independent risk factor for CV
mortality.
• The diabetic peripheral neuropathies (DPN) are heterogeneous with diverse
clinical manifestations. They may be diffuse or focal.597
• Diffuse neuropathies are:597
› distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN), and
› diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) particularly CV autonomic
neuropathy.
• Focal neuropathies include:597
› mononeuritis, and
› radiculopathies.
Diabetic symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN)
• The likelihood of having DSPN is higher in the presence of:598
› neuropathic symptoms,
› absent or decreased ankle reflex,
› decreased distal sensation,
› distal muscle weakness or atrophy, and
› abnormal nerve conduction study.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
A. Screening and diagnosis
• DSPN should be assessed with a 10-g monofilament (starting from the
dorsum of hallux, then moving proximally); and one other modality:
› pin prick,
› vibration sense using a 128-Hz tuning fork,
› ankle reflexes; or
› vibration perception threshold testing using a biothesiometer.
These increase the sensitivity of detecting DSPN by 87%.599-602 (Level II-3)
• These bedside tests should be performed at least annually.597 (Level III)
• Consider screening for people with prediabetes/T2DM who have symptoms
of peripheral neuropathy.
• In most cases, DSPN can be diagnosed clinically and electrophysiological
tests are rarely required. Electrophysiological tests can be considered if
there are atypical features:597 (Level III)
› rapid onset or progression of neuropathy,
› asymmetrical neuropathy,
› predominantly motor neuropathy,
› if other causes are considered; or
› in cases of diagnostic uncertainty.
• Symptoms of neuropathic pain include:603
› burning pain,
› painful cold, electric shock-like pain
› tingling pain, or
› sensation of pins and needles, and
› may be associated with paraesthesia, dysesthesia, or allodynia.
• Validated questionnaires are available to assess for neuropathic pain due to
DSPN. However, these are for screening rather than diagnosis and include:
› painDETECT604
› DN4605
› LANSS Pain Scale606
› ID pain607 (Refer Malaysian Association for the Study of Pain’s Management
of Neuropathic Pain (2nd edition), 2012. Available at: http://www.masp.org.
my/index.cfm?menuid=21)
Of the above, DN4 and ID pain are simple and feasible for use in clinical practice,
whilst LANSS Pain Scale and painDetect is more detailed and more frequently
used for research purposes.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
B. Management
• Intensive lifestyle intervention
› In T2DM, reduces the risk of DSPN.608 (Level II-1)
› In prediabetes, reduces the risk of DSPN especially in the subgroup that
did not progress to T2DM.609 (Level II-2)
• Intensive glycaemic control has been shown to have a modest effect on
reducing the risk of DSPN in people with T2DM.610 (Level II-1)
• No pharmacologic therapy has been shown to be effective in treating DSPN.
However, there are drugs approved for pain associated with DSPN (Refer
Table 5-5).
• Combination therapy of 2 medications may be more effective than higher
doses of either medication as monotherapy.611 (Level I)
• Tricyclic antidepressants carry a higher risk of sedation and/or orthostatic
hypotension and should be used with caution in older people at risk of
falls.612 (Level II-1)
• Opioids carry a high risk of sedation, dependence, and other side-effects,
hence should only be used in combination with other agents, instead of as
first-line treatment for pain due to DSPN.
› The efficacy of tramadol is likely due to its serotonin and noradrenaline
uptake blocking effect.
• Consider referring patients to pain specialists (if available), in particular if
they require long-term opioid treatment.597 (Level III)

SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Diagnosis of CAN
› Use of standardised CV autonomic reflex tests (CART) is recommended for
diagnosis.
› Commonly utilised tests are postural BP, heart rate (HR) variability upon
standing and deep breathing at 6 breaths/min.
› The presence of 2 or more abnormal CART results is generally accepted as
diagnostic.
› The presence of abnormal CART with orthostatic hypotension (>20/10 mmHg
drop) identifies severe or advanced CAN.630 (Level III)
› Precautions prior to testing:630 (Level III)
- optimise plasma glucose, and
- avoid caffeine intake, smoking, or alcohol for at least 2 hours prior, and
- avoid performing test within 2 hours after a main meal or prandial insulin
injection.
› Use age-appropriate CART reference values when available.
• Diagnosis of gastroparesis
› By:631 (Level III)
- a combination of symptoms (Refer Table 5-6),
- demonstration of delayed gastric emptying time; and
- exclusion of gastric outlet obstruction or ulceration.
› The gold-standard test to diagnose gastroparesis is gastric emptying
scintigraphy.
B. Management
• Intensive control of modifiable CV risk factors have been shown to reduce the
progression and development of CAN among patients with T2DM.632 (Level I)
• Avoid/minimise drugs that cause orthostatic hypotension.
› Midodrine has been approved as medical therapy for orthostatic
hypotension.6 (Level III)
› Other recommended interventions include acute water ingestion for
short-term relief, physical counter-pressure manoeuvres, compression
garments, fludrocortisone, and increasing salt and water intake.633 (Level III)
• Exercise programs and multifactorial interventions for fall prevention has
been shown to reduce the risk of falls in older people at moderate and high
risk.634 (Level III)
› Consider referral to centres specialising in fall prevention (if available).
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Small frequent meals with low fat and fibre content are recommended in
gastroparesis.631,635 (Level III)
• Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin aids in relieving gastroparetic
symptoms but may be limited by tachyphylaxis.636 (Level III)
• Short-term metoclopramide may be used in severe cases.6 (Level III)
› Long-term use of metoclopramide may be complicated by neuromuscular
complications, e.g. tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal side-effects.637
› Alternatively, domperidone acts similarly to metoclopramide, but with less
neurological side-effects due to reduced penetration across the bloodbrain barrier.638 (Level III)
Diabetic amyotrophy
• Diabetic amyotrophy, also known as proximal diabetic neuropathy, diabetic
lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, or Bruns-Garland syndrome is an
uncommon subtype of diabetic neuropathy affecting about 0.8% to 1% of
people with diabetes.639 (Level II-2) 640 (Level III)
• It Is characterised by weakness and areflexia of asymmetric onset, pain on
the affected site and marked weight loss.641 (Level III)
A. Diagnosis
• Is made by excluding nerve root compression with MRI.
• Supported by the presence of small amplitude sensory nerve action potential
from nerve conduction studies, and fibrillation potentials and long duration
high amplitude motor unit action potential from electromyogram.641 (Level III)
B. Management
• Treatment of pain due to diabetic amyotrophy follows similar recommendation
on for treatment for pain due to DSPN.597 (Level III)
• Data on the effect of glycaemic control on diabetic amyotrophy is lacking.
However, given the known benefits of preventing neuropathy and other
diabetic complications, glucose control should be optimized.641,642 (Level III)
• Diabetic amyotrophy progresses over months, and eventually stabilises and
improves.643 (Level II-2)

SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
5.4 Cardiovascular disease
A. Coronary heart disease
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• In addition to the importance of managing hyperglycaemia,
management of the other traditional concomitant CV risk factors;
i.e. BP and LDL-C remain important - with BP targets of 130-139/7079 mmHg and LDL-C according to CV risk category, with proven
clinically meaningful CV risk reduction.
• Recent CVOTs have proven that certain GLDs (GLP1-RAs and SGLT2-i)
are also cardioprotective, beyond their glucose-lowering effects.
These CV benefits are seen irrespective of HbA1c level achieved.
Paradigm shifts in management algorithm recommendations are
emerging.
• There is an emerging role of SGLT2-i to reduce heart failure
hospitalisations in high risk ASCVD patients.
• However, if these newer medications are not available, achieving
HbA1c safely, remains an important target.
• T2DM is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD),
manifesting as angina, MI, CCF and sudden death. In addition, T2DM may
lead to diabetic cardiomyopathy. CHD accounts for up to 2/3rd of deaths
associated with T2DM.6 (Level III) 644 (Level II-2)
• In the 2015-2016 acute coronary syndrome registry (National Cardiovascular
Disease Database – NCVD-ACS registry), 44.7% of patients had T2DM as a
CV risk. This was the 2nd most common CV risk factor, after hypertension at
63.3% (Available online at http://www.acrm.org.my/ncvd/ )4 (Level II-3)
• The increased risk of CHD in patients with T2DM is only partially explained by
concomitant risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, smoking and
obesity.
• Hyperglycaemia itself and its consequences are highly linked to the increased
risk of CHD and its related mortality.645,646 (Level II-1)
• Among those above the age of 60, there is a similar occurrence of MI in
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
T2DM patients and in those without T2DM who had previous MI, thus giving
rise to the notion that T2DM is a CHD-defining disease.647 (Level II-2) Cardiometabolic risks associated with T2DM and CHD in T2DM should be managed
aggressively.647,648 (Level II-2)
• CHD in T2DM is characterised by its early onset,649 (Level II-2) extensive disease at
the time of diagnosis, and higher morbidity and mortality after MI.650,651 (Level II-2)
• Angiographic findings in diabetes are more diffuse, involving multiple
coronary arteries including small and distal vessels.652 (Level II-2) 653,654 (Level I)
• There is a strong and continuous association between proteinuria and future
risk of CHD.655 (Level I)
• Heart failure hospitalisation incidence in people with T2DM (even after
adjusting for confounders, e.g. age and sex) has been found to be 2-fold
higher, compared to those without diabetes.656-658 (Level II-2). Predictors of heart
failure development were younger age and higher BMI.658 (Level II-2)
› Poor glycaemic control is also associated with increased risk of HF; every
1% increase in HbA1c is associated with an 8% increased risk of heart failure
(95% CI 5%,12%).659 (Level II-2)
› Approximately 40% of hospitalised heart failure patients with low ejection
fraction have T2DM. Post discharge, T2DM is associated with worse
prognosis, increased risk for combined CV mortality and heart failurerelated re-hospitalisation.660 (Level II-2)
Screening
• Typical symptoms of CHD warrant a prompt referral to a cardiologist for
further assessment. However, it is quite common for patients with T2DM to
have atypical symptoms or even ‘silent’ CHD.
• Atypical symptoms include dyspnoea, fatigue, and GI symptoms associated
with exertion.661 (Level II-1)
• In asymptomatic patients, routine screening for coronary artery disease is
not recommended because it does not improve outcome as long as they are
receiving intensive medical therapy for optimal CV risk factor control.662 (Level I)
› Risk calculators: There is uncertainty whether current strategies for
providing CVD risk scores affect CVD events. The identified studies have
multiple study limitations and substantial heterogeneity in interventions,
outcomes and analyses making interpretation of results difficult.663 (Level I)
› New models for implementing and evaluation CVD risk scores in adequately
powered studies are needed to define the role of applying CVD risk scores
in primary CVD prevention.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Screening for presence of CHD should be done for:
› T2DM patients with peripheral or cerebrovascular disease;647,648 (Level I) and
› T2DM patients with presence of proteinuria and DKD.655 (Level I)
• Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is indicated for T2DM patients:
› with hypertension; or
› if CVD is suspected.664 (Level II-2)
Recommendations: Screening for CVD
2. In asymptomatic patients whose CV risk factors are
not to target.
Grade A
3. A resting ECG is indicated in patients with T2DM and
hypertension, or if CVD is suspected.
Grade B
1. In asymptomatic patients, routine screening for
coronary artery disease is not recommended. Routine
screening does not improve outcomes as long as
ASCVD risk factors are treated to target.
Grade A
Management
I. General management
• Lifestyle modification, weight management and increased physical activity
are important measures.95,665-667 (Level I)
› Reduced caloric intake to lower excessive body weight and regular
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of ≥150 minutes/week is beneficial
in improving CV risk factors, glycaemic control and inducing remission of
T2DM. (Refer Section 3.5)
› Mortality and CV event reduction with lifestyle intervention alone has not
been demonstrated in RCTs.
• Smoking cessation is strongly recommended and a high priority.668 (Level I)
› Smoking increases the risk of CVD and premature death.
II. Glycaemic control
• Intensive glycaemic control has more beneficial CV effects when achieved
early and maintained throughout the course of T2DM management.310,376,377
(Level I)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• For management strategies of hyperglycaemia in patients admitted with
acute coronary syndrome/unstable angina/heart failure, refer to Section 6.1
(management in acute illness).
• In patients with T2DM with stable heart failure, metformin may be continued
if estimated glomerular filtration rate remains >30 mL/min/1.73 m2.669 (Level II)
• TZDs should be avoided in patients with pre-existing heart failure due to
increased risk of fluid retention.303 (Level I)
• DPP4-i have demonstrated CV safety (TECOS, CARMELINA SAVORTIMI).160,191-193 (Level I)
› However, saxagliptin should be avoided in patients with pre-existing heart
failure6 (Level III) as it has been shown to be associated with increased risk of
hospitalisation for heart failure.193 (Level I)
• SGLT2-i/GLP1-RA have been shown to demonstrate CV benefit in those with
ASCVD or who are at high CV risk irrespective of HbA1c achieved.201,202,248,259,670-672
(Level I)
• In addition, SGLT2-i in T2DM with ASCVD or high risk for ASCVD or DKD
have been confirmed to significantly reduce hospitalisation for heart
failure.201,203,673-676 (Level I) Most of the patients in these trials did not have heart
failure at baseline (ranging from 10.0%-14.4%).
› A meta-analysis of two dedicated heart failure trials,950 (Level I) DAPA-HF206
(Level I) and EMPEROR-Reduced,951 (Level I) that recruited patients with HFrEF
(42-50% with known T2DM) showed:
- Over a median of 16.0-18.2 months, there was a significant reduction in
risk of CV death or heart failure (HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.68-0.84, p<0.0001) vs.
placebo.950 (Level I)
- There was also significant reduction in first hospitalisation for heart
failure (HR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.62-0.78, P<0.0001) vs. placebo.950 (Level I)
- These significant benefits were seen in both patients with T2DM as well
as those without (Refer to Section 3.6-SGLT2-i).206,950,951 (Level I)
› These heart failure benefits are found irrespective of glucose-lowering
and also in non-diabetic subjects,206,950 (Level I)
› SGLT2-i has been given a specific indication for use to reduce hospitalisation
for heart failure in adults with T2DM with ASCVD or multiple CV risk (use
SGLT2-i that has label indication for heart failure prevention).
• Less rigorous glycaemic targets may be appropriate for elderly patients and
those with severe co-morbidities or advanced CVD.310 (Level III)
III. BP control (Refer to Section 3.9.1)
• BP control to target of 130-139/70-79 mmHg with coronary artery disease
(existing ASCVD or 10-year ASCVD of ≥15%) if it can be safely achieved.361-366 (Level I)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• In patients with known ASCVD, consider ACE inhibitor368,369 (Level I) or ARB
therapy if ACE inhibitor intolerant370 (Level I) to reduce the risk of CV events.
IV. Lipid control (Refer to Section 3.9.2)
V. Antiplatelet therapy
• There is strong evidence that aspirin is effective for secondary prevention of
cardiovascular events.677,678 (Level I)
• The Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspirin for
Diabetes (JPAD) study showed that daily low-dose aspirin (81 or 100 mg
daily) taken for >4 years in asymptomatic people with T2DM failed to show a
significant effect on a broad composite of CVD endpoints. However, the risk
of fatal coronary or cerebrovascular events was significantly decreased in
the aspirin group in those >65 years old.549 (Level I)
• A recent large primary prevention trial (ASCEND trial) showed reduction in
CV events but with an increased rate of GI haemorrhage.679
› 2 other studies showed no benefit in primary prevention.680,681
› In general, those with low risk (<50 year of age with no major risk for
ASCVD) aspirin is not recommended as primary prevention.
• However, in those who are at increased CV risk, aspirin therapy may be
considered after a discussion with the patient on the benefits vs. increased
risk of bleeding.549,678,679,682,683 (Level I)
• For patients with ASCVD and documented aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/
day) may be used.677 (Level I)
VI. Revascularisation
• In T2DM patients with NSTEMI, early invasive revascularisation (where
possible), will result in similar or greater reduction in death and MI compared
to the overall population.684 (Level I)
• T2DM should be considered as a distinct disease entity that is critical for the
selection of myocardial revascularisation strategies in multi vessel disease.
› Current evidence indicates that in stable patients with coronary anatomy
suitable for both procedures and low predicted surgical mortality, CABG
is superior to PCI in reducing the composite risk of death, MI, or stroke, as
well as death.685-687 (Level I)
• Presence of diabetic retinopathy is not a contraindication for thrombolytic
therapy.688 (Level II-1)

2. Multi-factorial management to achieve glycaemic, BP
and lipid targets to reduce CV events.
Grade A
3. Aspirin should be used for secondary prevention
in T2DM patients. For patients with ASCVD and
documented aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day)
should be used.
Grade A
4. Primary prevention of ASCVD with low dose aspirin
(100 mg) is only recommended in patients at increased
cardiovascular risk after discussion with the patient on
benefits vs. risk of bleeding.
Grade A
5. In patients with T2DM with established atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, consider adding SGLT2-i/
GLP1-RA with demonstrated CV benefit as part of the
glucose lowering regimen.
Grade A
7. In patients with T2DM and multi vessel coronary artery
disease or complex left anterior descending coronary
artery disease, and suitable coronary anatomy for
revascularization, CABG is superior to PCI.
Grade A
6. Among patients with ASCVD with pre-existing or at
high risk of heart failure (HFrEF) SGLT2-i should be
considered, even if HbA1c is at target.

SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
B. Cerebrovascular disease (Stroke)
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• 3-point MACE outcomes in the recent CVOTs incorporate non-fatal
stroke as part of the composite CV outcome.
• Recent GLP1-RA trials (SUSTAIN-6 and REWIND) have found positive
3-point MACE outcome, largely driven by reduction in non-fatal
stroke. These interesting findings may need to be confirmed in
dedicated cerebrovascular event trials.
• Hyperglycaemia which is present in 40% of patients with stroke on admission,
is strongly predictive of poor clinical outcomes and high mortality.689 (Level 11-2)
• The Asia-Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration (APCSC) found that the HR
for ischaemic stroke was 2.64 (95% CI 1.78,3.92); and the age, sex adjusted
HR for death from cerebrovascular disease was 2.02 (95% CI 1.57,2.59) in
individuals with T2DM, compared to non-T2DM. The ratios were the same in
the Asian and Australasian subgroups.690 (Level II-2) The risk of stroke is higher in
women than in men.647,648 (Level II-2)
• There is no recommendation for intensive IV or SC insulin in these patients as
there was no improvement in functional outcomes at 90 days.691 (Level I)
• Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), PROACTIVE cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT)
showed positive outcomes for 3-point MACE of which the most significant
was reduction of 47% of recurrent stroke.692 (Level 1) However, side-effects of
TZDs of weight gain, increased risk of CHF and osteoporotic fracture render
the benefit-risk ratio unfavourable.
• GLP1-RA CVOTs have shown positive 3-point MACE outcomes largely driven
by significant reduction of non-fatal stroke (39% risk reduction in SUSTAIN-6
and 24% risk reduction in REWIND).248,259 (Level I)
Recommendations: Stroke
1. Patients with ischaemic stroke should be managed
similarly as patients with established ASCVD.
Grade B
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
C. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Absent peripheral pulses are independent predictors of major
vascular outcomes in patients with T2DM. These clinical indicators
can be used to improve risk stratification for patients with T2DM.
• Presence of critical limb ischaemia features (e.g. rest pain with
ulcers or tissue loss) identifies a high-risk individual for amputation
and/or mortality. Urgent referral to specialist care is indicated.
• People with T2DM have a three-fold increased risk of developing peripheral
arterial disease (PAD), which mainly affects the infra-popliteal arteries.693 (Level III)
• The diagnosis of PAD in T2DM is often delayed due to the presence of
concomitant neuropathy which results in the lack of typical PAD symptoms.43,694
(Level III)
• Absence of peripheral pulses has been shown to be an independent predictor
of risk for major CV outcomes, heart failure and nephropathy.695 (Level II-1)
• Risk factors for PAD in T2DM include:696,697 (Level II-2)
› older age
› longer duration of T2DM
› higher HbA1c
› elevated SBP
› low HDL-C levels
› previous CVD
› smoking
Assessment
• All patients with T2DM undergoing annual screening for peripheral
neuropathy should also be assessed for peripheral vascular disease, with
appropriate history taking and palpation of the peripheral pulses (femoral,
popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery).693,694,698 (Level III)
• If PAD is suspected from the initial screening, several non-invasive bedside
tests can be done for further evaluation (Table 5-7).43,694,698,699 (Level III)
› Ankle brachial index (ABI) is used widely due to feasibility.
› Toe brachial index (TBI) is useful in the presence of medial calcinosis.

recommended.694 (Level III)
• Patients with features of critical limb ischaemia (rest pain with ulcers or
tissue loss due to PAD) are at high risk of amputation and mortality and
should be referred urgently for specialist care.700,701 (Level III)
Management
• Principles of PAD management in T2DM:699 (Level III)
› Reducing CV risk factors and treating concomitant disorders.43,694 (Level III)
- Smoking cessation and lifestyle modification.
- Statins for secondary prevention of CV events; aim for LDL-C <1.4mmol/L
or LDL-C reduction of at least 50% from baseline.
- Adequate blood pressure and glycaemic control.
- Anti-thrombotic therapy.43,699 (Level III)
- Single anti-platelet therapy (SAPT) is recommended only in symptomatic
PAD or after revascularization.
- For those requiring SAPT, clopidogrel may be preferred over aspirin.677 (Level I)
- Double anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) is used only for a limited period
after certain revascularization procedures.
- Combination therapy of low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg bd) and aspirin
(100 mg od) can be considered in patients with chronic symptomatic PAD
and T2DM who do not have a high risk of bleeding.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
» In the COMPASS trial PAD sub analysis, the aspirin-rivaroxaban
combination significantly reduced composite endpoint of stroke, MI
or CV death, major adverse limb events and amputations. However, a
significant increase in major bleeding risk, particularly GI bleeding, was
observed.702 (Level I)
• Improving peripheral circulation in symptomatic patients.43,694,699 (Level III)
› Those with symptoms of PAD and diabetic foot ulcer/infection must be
assessed and treated urgently as they are at a high risk for major limb
amputation.
› Revascularization must be attempted when possible and amputation only
considered when revascularization options fail.
› Consider revascularization in a patient with PAD and a diabetic foot ulcer
that is not healing despite 4-6 weeks of optimal management.
› Patients with intermittent claudication can improve their walking distance
by doing regular exercise training programmes. However, those with
severe/disabling claudication may require revascularization.
Recommendations: Peripheral Arterial Disease
4. Critical limb ischaemia warrants prompt referral and
multidisciplinary management.
Grade C
1. Patients with suspected PAD from initial screening
are recommended to be further evaluated with
bedside tests such as ABI, TBI or CWD.
Grade B

MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
5.5 Diabetic foot
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Screening for peripheral neuropathy with loss of protective
sensation (LOPS) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) should be
done at diagnosis and repeated at least annually.
• High risk feet (history of ulcers or amputations, foot deformities,
LOPS, PAD) will need more frequent detailed foot assessment.
• The prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer is 15% over the course of the disease703
(Level II-2) while the prevalence of lower limb amputation is 4.3%704 (Level III) and
remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
• Peripheral neuropathy which is asymptomatic in up to 50%704 (Level III) of
patients, predisposes to ulcerations and vasculopathy further retards the
healing process.
Risk factors for foot ulcers and amputation
• Risk factors include:6,705 (Level III)
› previous amputation,
› history of foot ulcer, pre-ulcerative callous or corn, and foot deformity,
› peripheral neuropathy with loss of protective sensation (LOPS),
› peripheral arterial disease (PAD),
› visual impairment,
› DKD – especially patients on dialysis,
› poor glycaemic control, and
› cigarette smoking.
Assessment of diabetic foot ulcers
• All patients with T2DM should be assessed for risk of diabetic foot ulcers with
proper history taking and comprehensive foot evaluation (Refer the Malaysian
CPG for Management of Diabetic Foot [2nd edition] available at https://www.
moh.gov.my/moh/resources/Penerbitan/CPG/Orthopaedics/Draft%20CPG%20

SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Screening for peripheral neuropathy with LOPS and PAD should be done
at diagnosis and repeated at least annually.694,698 (Level III) For peripheral
neuropathy with LOPS, refer to Section 5.3.
› For PAD assessment is by palpation of foot pulses. Ankle brachial index
testing should be performed.
• Those at high risk (history of ulcers or amputations, foot deformities, LOPS,
PAD) will need more frequent detailed foot assessment.706 (Level III)
Prevention
• All patients with T2DM should receive foot care education at least annually,
and more frequently in those with high risk foot conditions.694,698 (Level III)
• Relevant patient education such as:6,694,698 (Level III)
› proper care of feet including nail and skin care,
› daily visual inspection of feet with a mirror, in those with LOPS,
› check for presence of foreign or penetrating objects before putting on
footwear,
› advise not to walk barefoot outdoors or indoors,
› selection of appropriate footwear according to foot risk, including certain
prescribed footwear for high risk patients; and
› seek early treatment in presence of active diabetic foot problems (e.g.
ulceration, infection, gangrene or limb ischaemia).
Management
• Patients with active diabetic foot problems (ulceration, infection, gangrene,
critical limb ischaemia, acute Charcot neuroarthropathy) should be referred
urgently and seen within 24 hours in secondary/tertiary care, and preferably
managed by a multidisciplinary foot care team.698 (Level III)
• Trauma induced ulcers with no other risk factors will require the standard
wound care and close follow-up until full recovery.
• Antibiotics should be used as an adjunct to surgical debridement for diabetic
foot ulcers with local or systemic infection but should not be used to prevent
infection.694,698 (Level III)
• Appropriate analgesia should be given for adequate pain relief in those with
painful neuropathy.698 (Level III)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
Recommendations: Diabetic foot
3. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for
patients with foot ulcers and high-risk feet.
Grade B
1. All patients with T2DM are recommended to have
at least annual comprehensive foot assessment to
identify individuals with risk factors, as well as receive
foot care education to avoid ulcers and amputations.
Grade B
2. Active diabetic foot ulceration, infection, gangrene,
critical limb ischaemia require urgent referral and
appropriate management.

5.6 Sexual dysfunction
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Erectile dysfunction is common in T2DM men. It has been reported
to be a marker for potential CVD. Screening for CHD in T2DM men
with ED is recommended.
• Hypogonadism also occurs more frequently in T2DM men and should
be excluded.
• Testosterone therapy improves response to PDE-5 inhibitors.
5.6.1 Erectile dysfunction
• Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve, maintain or sustain
an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse that may result from
psychological, neurological, hormonal, arterial, or cavernosal impairment or
from a combination of these factors.707,708 (Level II-3)
• The prevalence of ED among diabetic men varies from 35% to 45%.709-717 (Level II-3)
› ED is three times more common in men with T2DM and its annual, ageadjusted incidence is doubled compared to men without T2DM.718,719 (Level II-1)
› Compared to men without T2DM, it occurs 10-15 years earlier and is less
responsive to treatment.719-721 (Level II-3)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• ED has been reported to be a marker for potential CVD, with significant
association with all-cause mortality and CV events.722-725 (Level II-2)
• Risk factors of ED710-712,721,726-729 (Level II-2)
› Advancing age, duration of T2DM, poor glycaemic control, presence
of diabetic microvascular complications, CV disease, hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking and androgendeficiency/hypogonadism.
• Rates of hypogonadism are higher in men with T2DM compared to the
general population.
› Prevalence of 30%-40% hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism has been
reported in men with T2DM.730,731 (Level II-2)
› Symptoms and signs suggestive of hypogonadism are reduced libido,
absence of early morning erection and testicular atrophy.
Screening and diagnosis
• All adult men with T2DM should be regularly screened for ED. Many patients
do not voluntarily offer the history.732
• All patients with T2DM and ED should be screened for CHD.
• Hypogonadism should be excluded in men with T2DM and ED.
› Early morning blood for total testosterone (taken before 11.00 am) should
be performed.733 (Level III)
• Screening can be done using the 5-item version of the International Index of
Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire (Refer Appendix 10 ).734,735 (Level I)
Management
• No RCTs have shown that improving glycaemic control directly prevents or
improves ED.
• However, indirect evidence derived from the UKPDS541 and ACCORD610
showed that early intensive glucose control reduced the incidence of
neuropathy, which is a major contributing factor for ED.
• Optimisation of glycaemic control, management of other co-morbidities and
lifestyle modifications should be encouraged.(Level III)
• Psychosexual counselling is recommended in functional ED.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Where possible, avoid medications that may cause or worsen ED such as:
› beta blockers, alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics,
› tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, lithium, neuroleptics; and
› anticonvulsants.
• Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil
should be offered as first-line therapy.736-740 (Level I)
› There is evidence that scheduled daily therapy is effective in the population
with T2DM and ED741 (Level I) 742 (Level II-1) and may improve efficacy with lower
rates of side effects.
› PDE-5 inhibitors are contraindicated in unstable angina, poor exercise
tolerance or concomitant nitrate medication.
› Referral to a urologist may be necessary for those not responding to PDE-5
inhibitors or in whom PDE-5 inhibitors is contraindicated.743 (Level III)
• Other therapies include intracavernosal injections, intraurethral alprostadil,
vacuum devices with constricting band and surgery.
• Testosterone therapy should only be offered to those who are proven to
have hypogonadism and are symptomatic.744 (Level I) 745 (Level II-2)
› Testosterone therapy improves the efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitors.746 (Level II-1)
747 (Level II-2)
› Several non-randomised, observational studies have produced conflicting
results with regards to cardiac risk vs. benefit from testosterone
replacement.748 (Level I) 749,750 (Level II-2)
Testosterone replacement therapy for ED
1. Biochemical confirmation of hypogonadism
2. Testosterone (parenteral/oral/transdermal)
3. PDE-5 inhibitor

5.6.2 Female sexual dysfunction
• Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is defined as persistent or recurring decrease
in sexual arousal, dyspareunia and difficulty or inability to achieve an orgasm
that leads to personal distress and relationship difficulties.751 (Level III)
› It consists of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder
and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.752 (Level III)
› Most women experience a combination of these disorders.
• FSD is estimated to occur in 24-75% of women with T2DM.753-761 (Level III)
• Risk factors:
› Age, duration of diabetes, poor glycaemic control, menopause, micro- and
macro-vascular T2DM complications, and psychological factors (depression
and anxiety disorder).754-756,759,761-763 (Level II-2)
Screening and diagnosis
• All women with T2DM should be asked about sexual dysfunction.
• Brief sexual symptom checklist can be used as initial screening.
• The patient’s medical, surgical, social and psychiatric history should also be
obtained.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Diagnosis of FSD can be established by using FSFI questionnaire that consists
of 19 questions covering all domains of sexual dysfunction764 (Level III) available
at www.fsfiquestionnaire.com.
• Physical examination should include assessment of thyroid status or for
presence of galactorrhoea.
• Gynaecological examination should be performed if indicated.
• Oestrogen deficiency is usually detected by history and examination.
• Investigations764 (Level III)

Management
• Emphasis should be made to treat psychosocial disorders and relationship
disharmony.
• Optimisation of glycaemic control should be encouraged.
• Where possible, avoid drugs that may affect sexual function:
› beta blockers, alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics,
› tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, lithium, neuroleptics,
› anticonvulsants,
› oral contraceptive pills.
• In

5.7 Mental health issues in T2DM
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Diabetes distress/depression is common and increasingly recognised
as a barrier to patients' ability to cope and self-manage their diabetes.
• Psychological and social factors need to be assessed as an integral
part of management.
• Referral to a Mental Health specialist may be indicated in specific
circumstances.
• Psychological comorbidity, such as depression and/or diabetes-specific
emotional distress (diabetes distress), is widespread in people with T2DM
with an overall prevalence of 36% for diabetes distress and 15% for
depression.768,769 (Level II-2)
• In a study involving 2508 patients with T2DM from 12 health clinics in
Malaysia, 11.5% were found to have depression.770 (Level II-2)
• Psychological and social factors are important influences on the ability
of patients to cope with the daily demand of diabetes care and selfmanagement.
• Patients with depression and diabetic distress are more likely to have poorer
health outcomes including uncontrolled blood sugars,771 (Level III) complications
from diabetes, reduced quality of life and higher rates of all-cause mortality.772
(Level I)
• It is pertinent to address mental status of T2DM:
› at the time of diagnosis
› at diagnosis of complications
› when there is loss of glycaemic control/lack of treatment compliance
› at time of treatment intensification.
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
• Symptoms to look for may include prolonged period of moodiness with any
or all of the following:
› appetite changes,
› loss of interest in daily activities,
› feeling of despair,
› inappropriate sense of guilt,
› sleep disturbance,
› weight loss,
› suicidal thoughts.
• Indications for referral to a mental health specialist may include:
› depression with the possibility of self-harm,
› debilitating anxiety (alone or with depression),
› indications of an eating disorder,
› cognitive functioning that significantly impairs judgment.
• Behavioural treatment interventions which include cognitive behavioural
therapy and exercise as shown in Program ACTIVE II has demonstrated
clinically meaningful improvements in depression outcomes in adults with
T2DM and major depressive disorder.773 (Level I)
• It is important to acknowledge that mental health well-being is a very
important part of diabetes management.774,775 (Level III)
Recommendations: Mental health issues in T2DM
1. Diabetes distress/depression is common. Assessment
of psychological and social wellbeing should be
performed as part of continuing diabetes management;
at diagnosis, onset of complications, when diabetes is
out of control and whenever indicated.
Grade C
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
5.8 Periodontal disease in T2DM
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Oral health education should be provided to all patients with T2DM
emphasizing the increased risk of periodontal disease in T2DM. This
should include:
› the bi-directional relationship of periodontal disease and T2DM
› adverse effects on HbA1c control due to untreated periodontal
disease
› successful management of periodontal disease will improve
metabolic parameters
• There is a direct relationship between periodontitis and cardio-renal
complications of T2DM. T2DM patients with periodontitis have been
found to have an increased CV mortality and morbidity, and also
increased mortality in patients with DKD.
• Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease, comprising two main
categories:
› gingivitis; and
› periodontitis which involves destruction of the tooth supporting structures
such as the alveolar bone, periodontal ligament and cementum. If left
untreated it causes tooth loss.776 (Level III)
• Signs and symptoms include:
› bleeding gums during brushing or eating,
› loose teeth, spacing or spreading of the teeth,
› oral malodour; and/or
› abscesses in the gums or gingival suppuration.
• Severe periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, nutritional compromise,
altered speech, low self-esteem and a poorer overall quality of life.67 (Level II-2)
• The bi-directional effects of periodontitis and T2DM
› Individuals with T2DM have been reported to be approximately twice as
likely to have more severe periodontal attachment loss than those without
T2DM, after controlling for other variables.65,777-779 (Level II-2)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
› Clinical studies have shown that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
mediators within the periodontal tissues of people with poorly controlled
T2DM play a role in increased periodontal destruction70 (Level III) as well as
contribute to insulin resistance and worsening glycaemic control.780 (Level III)
› Severe periodontitis has been associated with increased HbA1c levels.66 (Level II-2)
- The magnitude of increase in HbA1c attributed to periodontitis in T2DM
was 0.29% (95% CI 0.20,0.27).66 (Level II-2) 70 (Level III) 781 (Level I)
- Subjects with severe periodontitis are at an increased risk of developing
(incident) T2DM (adjusted HR 1.19-1.33).66 (Level II-2)
• There is a direct relationship between the severity of periodontitis and
cardio-renal complications of T2DM.66,782 (Level II-2)
› The comorbid presence of periodontitis and T2DM in patients with DKD
is reported to elevate the 10-year all-cause mortality risk by 23% and CV
mortality risk by 16%.783,70 (Level III)
› CV complications (CV mortality, CHD or cerebrovascular events, and
subclinical heart disease) have also been significantly associated with the
comorbid presence of T2DM and periodontitis (OR 2.2-2.6; 95%CI 1.44.2).66,784 (Level II-2)
Management
• Current evidence indicates that in people with T2DM, periodontal therapy
accompanied by effective self-care is both safe and effective. Clinical
periodontal parameters improve following standard non-surgical therapy
even in people with poorly controlled T2DM.70 (Level III) 785 (Level I)
• Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that HbA1C reductions
ranges from 0.27% to 0.48% at 3-4 months following periodontal therapy.
781,785-787 (Level I)
• The adjunctive use of antibiotics does not enhance HbA1C reduction beyond
scaling and root surface debridement alone among people with T2DM.70 (Level
III) 785 (Level I)
• As evidence mounts supporting the link between T2DM and periodontitis,
closer collaboration between physicians and oral health care professionals is
warranted to improve glycaemic control.70,788 (Level III) 69 (Level II-2)
• Additionally, there is a need for healthcare providers to routinely refer
these patients for oral healthcare as part of the holistic care for people with
T2DM.70 (Level III) 68,69 (Level II-2)
SECTION 5
MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
Recommendations: Periodontal disease
1. Oral health education should be provided to all
patients with T2DM emphasizing on the increased
risk of periodontal disease in T2DM. Successful
management of periodontal disease will improve
metabolic parameters.
Grade A
2. Physicians/medical health professionals should
investigate the presence of periodontal disease
as an integral part of T2DM care visits. If present,
prompt referral should be made to the dentist for
periodontal examination.

T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
SECTION 6
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Management of T2DM in acute illness, stress and surgery
› HbA1c should be considered for inpatients with hyperglycaemia or
known T2DM if it has not been done for the last 3 months.
› Insulin is the preferred pharmacological therapy for most
hospitalised patients with T2DM or hyperglycaemia.
• T2DM in adolescents
› Studies note that T2DM in the young represent a more severe and
rapidly progressive disorder than in adults, with a faster rate of
β-cell failure. This recognition has therapeutic significance with
regard to need for escalation of therapy.
› Although metformin and insulin are the mainstay of therapy for
adolescents with T2DM, liraglutide (a GLP1-RA) therapy may be
considered.
• T2DM in the elderly
› Plasma glucose and capillary plasma glucose should be used to
monitor glycaemic control.
› Optimal nutrition and regular exercise are recommended to
reduce frailty.
› Annual cognitive screening is recommended.
› Treatment de-escalation or discontinuation should be considered
in patients with multiple co-morbidities and poor life expectancy.
• T2DM in Ramadan

SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
6.1 Management of T2DM in acute illness, stress and
surgery
• Hyperglycaemia in acute illness may reflect previously known or undiagnosed
T2DM.
› Acute illness results in a number of physiological changes (e.g. increase in
circulating concentrations of stress hormones) or therapeutic interventions
(e.g. glucocorticoid use) that can exacerbate hyperglycaemia.789 (Level III)
• Hyperglycaemia in turn, causes physiological changes that exacerbate the
acute illness, such as decreased immune function and increased oxidative
stress. This leads to a vicious cycle of worsening illness and poor glycaemic
control.789 (Level III)
• Both, hyper- and hypoglycaemia among inpatients are associated with
adverse outcomes, including death.790-792 (Level I) 793 (Level II-3)
› Inpatient hyperglycaemia is associated with a mortality rate of 11.2%.794 (Level II-2)
• A dedicated inpatient diabetes service applying well-developed standards
and careful transition to prearranged outpatient management is important
to improve patient outcomes.795,796 (Level II-2)
Inpatient hyperglycaemia in acute illness
• Hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients can occur in those with:
› pre-existing T2DM; or
› no known history of T2DM.
• Inpatient hyperglycaemia is defined as any glucose value >7.8 mmol/L in
patients with no previous history of T2DM.797 (Level III)
• HbA1c should be considered for inpatients with hyperglycaemia or known
T2DM if it has not been done for the last 3 months.
› Admission HbA1c has been found to be a good predictor of glycaemic
control and response to insulin treatment, and tailoring treatment on
discharge.798,799(Level II-2)
Glycaemic control
A. In non-critically ill patients790-793,800,801 (Level I)
• Insulin is the preferred pharmacological therapy for most hospitalised
patients with T2DM or hyperglycaemia.
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
• In non-critically ill patients with T2DM, scheduled insulin regimens are
recommended to manage hyperglycaemia.
› During admission, OGLDs should be stopped when there is:
- poor oral intake,
- acute kidney injury,
- exposure to IV contrast dye (specifically for those on metformin),
- increasing severity of illness (illness becomes critical); and/or
- organ failure (e.g. renal failure, liver failure or heart failure).
› Regimens using insulin analogues and human insulin result in similar
glycaemic control in the hospital setting.802 (Level I)
› However, stable patients without the above conditions or contraindications
to medications used can have their home medications continued while in
the hospital.789,793,800 (Level II-2)
• In non-critically ill hyperglycaemic patients (with/without known T2DM) who
are
› taking orally well, options include basal bolus regimen or oral therapies
provided no contraindications.791,792 (Level I)
› not taking orally well or kept nil by mouth, options include basal plus
insulin regimen or variable rate intravenous insulin infusion.791,792 (Level I)
• The target plasma glucose of 7.8 mmol/L-10 mmol/L is recommended for
majority of non-critically ill patients.797 (Level III)
• Avoid plasma glucose values ≤3.9 mmol/L; if present, the glucose-lowering
therapy should be modified, unless the event is easily explained by other
factors (e.g. a missed meal).797 (Level III)
B. In critically ill patients803-812 (Level I)
• Appropriate glycaemic targets for patients with in-patient hyperglycaemia
who are critically ill (ICU setting) have not been firmly established.803-812 (Level I)
• Intensive insulin therapy (targeting plasma glucose of 4.5 mmol/L-6.0 mmol/L)
has been associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and mortality
in the ICU setting compared to conventional glycaemic control (targeting
plasma glucose of <10 mmol/L).806 (Level II-1)
• Therefore, it is recommended to maintain plasma glucose levels between
7.8 mmol-10 mmol/L in critically ill patients.
• Variable Rate Intravenous Insulin infusion (VRIII) protocols with proven efficacy
and safety are recommended to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia.813,814 (Level III)
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
C. In surgery803,804,807-812,815-826 (Level I)
• Acute hyperglycaemia during surgery increases postsurgical complications,
morbidity and mortality.
• Tight glycaemic control to achieve normoglycaemia while avoiding
hypoglycaemia is recommended.
• Plasma glucose target recommended is 6.0 mmol/L-10 mmol/L.815,827,828 (Level II-2)
• Strategies for glycaemic control815 (Level II-2)
› If plasma glucose is within target, current regimen may be continued
provided there is no contraindication for the agent.
› If plasma glucose is above target, to consider SC insulin regimen or VRIII.
› During intra-operative period and/or fasting, stop OGLDs and convert to
insulin i.e. basal plus insulin or VRIII.
› Once tolerating orally with stable plasma glucose, to resume previous preoperative regimen.
Use of insulin
• The use of sliding scale insulin (SSI) in inpatient hospital setting is
strongly discouraged.
• SSI protocols, which are extensively used, when compared to a basalbolus regime have been shown to be associated with:
› increased glycaemic variability; and
› longer time to achieve glycaemic target.792,829 (Level I)
D. Special clinical situations
• Patients receiving enteral or parenteral feeding
› In patients receiving continuous enteral feeding, options include basal
plus, basal bolus or VRIII.830,831 (Level I)
› In patients receiving parenteral feeding, options include basal plus, bolus
insulin only or VRIII.831,832 (Level I)
• Patients receiving corticosteroid therapy
› All patients receiving glucocorticoids equivalent to Prednisolone of ≥5mg/
day should have their plasma glucose monitored for 24-48 hours and
insulin commenced if plasma glucose is persistently high.
› Choices of regimen include:833,834 (Level I)
- basal bolus,
- bolus (prandial) + NPH OM/BD
- VRIII
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
• Patients on continuous SC insulin infusion (CSII)
› In absence of contraindications, CSII can be continued during hospitalisation.
› If patient is unable (mentally or physically) to manage CSII or there is
presence of contraindications, it can be converted to basal bolus insulin
regimen or VRIII according to the situation.835,836 (Level III)
Transition from hospital to home
• During recovery, education on diabetes care including treatment regime,
plasma glucose monitoring and medical nutritional therapy are important
aspects of discharge planning.
• On discharge:
› Rapid reduction in HbA1c especially among those with long standing
uncontrolled disease and background retinopathy should be avoided to
prevent transient worsening of diabetes retinopathy.259,260,543 (Level I) 544-546 (Level II-3)
For further details, refer to the Ministry of Health, Practical Guide to Inpatient
Glycaemic Care, 2nd edition, 2020.
Recommendations: Management of T2DM in acute illnesses,
stress and surgery
1. In hospitalised patients without known diabetes,
plasma glucose >7.8, signifies hyperglycaemia and
warrants further monitoring.
Grade B
2. Inpatient target plasma glucose levels should be
between 7.8 mmol/L-10.0 mmol/L for majority of
critically ill and non-critically ill patients.
Grade B
6.2 T2DM in adolescents
• T2DM is rapidly increasing among the adolescents (ages 12-18 years) in
tandem with rising sedentary lifestyles, prevalence of obesity and increase
in-utero glycaemic exposure.837,838 (Level II-2)
• T2DM usually occurs in the 2nd decade coinciding with physiologic pubertal
insulin resistance, more common in female gender, increased adiposity,
family history of diabetes and low socioeconomic status.839
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
• Cross-sectional, observational and therapeutic trials suggest that T2DM in
the young might represent a more severe and rapidly progressive disorder
than in adults.840,841 (Level III)
› Obese adolescent T2DM has severe peripheral and hepatic insulin
resistance, with approximately 50% lower peripheral insulin sensitivity
than age-matched obese peers without diabetes.
› β-cells appear to fail at a faster rate (20-35% yearly deterioration)842,843 (Level
II-2) vs. T2DM in adults (7-11% yearly loss).844,845 (Level II-2)
› The decline in insulin secretion relative to insulin sensitivity, eventually
result in progression to prediabetes and T2DM.846-849 (Level II-2)
• Youths with T2DM are expected to have long disease duration and
accumulation of glycemia-related complications.
› In addition, there is prolonged lifetime exposure to the other atherogenic
risk factors, e.g. dyslipidaemia and hypertension.
› Current evidence indicates that onset of DKD, neuropathy and retinopathy
occur earlier and progressed faster in youth onset T2DM compared with
youth-onset T1DM.850-853 (Level II-2)
› Retinopathy853 (Level II-2) and DKD progression854 (Level II-2) are likely dependent
on the duration of disease and glycaemic control.
• T2DM may be misdiagnosed as T1DM
› in non-obese adolescents with diabetes,
› when ketosis/ketoacidosis is present at onset;855,856 (Level III) or
› when pancreatic autoantibodies are positive.857,858 (Level II-2)
• Other types of diabetes mellitus may be misdiagnosed as T2DM. These
include:
› obese T1DM,
› T1DM with low autoimmunity; or
› monogenic diabetes.
Screening and diagnosis
• Risk-based screening for prediabetes and/or T2DM should be considered
in adolescents or during onset of puberty who are overweight (BMI ≥85th
percentile) or obese (BMI ≥95th percentile) and who have one or more
additional risk factors for diabetes.859 (Level III)
• Screen at a minimum every 3 years (or more frequently if BMI is increasing)
starting at the age of 10 or at onset of puberty, if puberty occurs at a younger
age.6 (Level III)
› A glucose load of 1.75 g/kg body weight (maximum of 75 g) for OGTT is used.
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
• Fasting insulin and c-peptide should be interpreted with caution due to
considerable overlap between T1DM, T2DM and monogenic diabetes at
onset and within 2 years of diagnosis.
• The overlap is due to initial recovery phase (honeymoon period) of T1DM,
glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity impairing insulin and c-peptide secretion. Such
measurements are of little value in the acute phase of the illness.
Management
A. Approach to management (Refer Figure 6-1).
• Goal of treatment is to achieve HbA1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol; i.e. 8.6 mmol/L).861
(Level III)
• Home SMBG targets as follows:861 (Level III)
› Premeal: 4.0 mmol/L-7.0 mmol/L
› Post meal: 5.0 mmol/L-10.0 mmol/L
› Prebed: 4.4 mmol/L-7.8 mmol/L
• HbA1c should be measured every 3 months
• To avoid long-term complications, monitoring as described in Table 6-1 is
essential.862-864 (Level III)

T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
B. General management
• Management of T2DM in adolescents should involve the patient, his/her
family and cooperation from school personnel, emphasising healthy parental
modelling and conducive surroundings.
• Comprehensive education on self-management and recommendations must
be age-appropriate due to complex psychosocial elements and, sensitive to
the family’s cultural practices and financial resources.
• Comprehensive lifestyle programs that are integrated with diabetes
management to achieve 7%-10% decrease in weight in the overweight/
obese adolescent.
› Encourage at least 30 min-60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
at least 5 days/week (and strength training at least 3 days/week).
› Focus on healthy eating patterns i.e. decrease calorie-dense food
consumption.
• A multidisciplinary diabetes team, including a physician, diabetes nurse
educator, registered dietitian, and psychologist or social worker is important.
C. Pharmacotherapy
• The safety and efficacy of OGLDs in adolescents have not been established.
• Among all the GLDs currently used to treat T2DM in adults, only metformin
and insulin are FDA approved for use in adolescents <18 years of age.
• Metformin should be started at 500 mg OD. Gradual dose increment over 3-4
weeks, as tolerated until the maximal dose of 1000 mg BD is achieved.865
• Insulin may be required for initial metabolic control. Transition from insulin
to metformin can usually be made when metabolic stability is reached. This
may take 2-6 weeks.(Level III)
• If glycaemic targets are not achieved with metformin (with or without basal
insulin), liraglutide can be considered866-868 (Level I) (avoid in patients with family
history of medullary thyroid carcinoma/MEN 2).

6.3 T2DM in elderly
• In 2019, it was estimated that the proportion of Malaysian population aged
over 65 years was 6.7%.870
• Diabetes is more common in the elderly (>60 years old). The prevalence of
T2DM in individuals between the ages of 60-64, 65-69 and 70-74 are 42.4%,
43.4% and 40.6%, respectively.1
• The elderly with T2DM is a very heterogeneous group ranging from active
individuals with little comorbidity and complications to frail individuals with
multiple serious co-morbidities and disabling complications.
• There is also an increased rate of age-related concomitant illnesses e.g.
hypertension, renal impairment, ischaemic heart disease, cognitive impairment
and functional disabilities with increased risk of falls.
• The life expectancy within this elderly diabetic population is highly variable.
Management
• In the elderly with T2DM and established complications, intensive control
reduces only the risk of microvascular events but not macrovascular events
or mortality.71,376,871 (Level I)
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
• PPG values have been shown to be a better predictor of outcome in elderly
patients compared to HbA1c or pre-prandial glucose values.872 (Level I)
› Plasma glucose and capillary plasma glucose should be used instead.
• Greater variability of glucose values is associated with poorer cognition873
(Level III) despite equivalent glycaemic control.334,874 (Level II-3)
› Cognitive dysfunction and frailty increase the risk of hypoglycaemia and
vice versa.487,574,875 (Level III)
• Thus, glycaemic targets will depend on the severity of frailty and overall life
expectancy.
• The principle for choice of various OGLDs is similar in the elderly as in younger
patients.876 (Level III)
› SUs should be used with caution because of the risk of severe or fatal
hypoglycaemia.
› Risk of hypoglycaemia increases exponentially with age and is higher with
glibenclamide than gliclazide and glimepiride.877 (Level III)
› Glibenclamide is not recommended for use in patients with T2DM >60 years
of age.878 (Level III)
• Similar to OGLDs, the use of insulin in the elderly is associated with increased
risk of hypoglycaemia and therefore every effort should be made to minimise
the risk.
• Treatment de-escalation or discontinuation should be considered once organ
failure develops or end of life care is initiated.879 (Level III)
• Institutionalised elderly patients have impaired hormonal regulation and
counter-regulation, suboptimal hydration, variable appetite and nutritional
intake, polypharmacy and slowed intestinal absorption.880 (Level III)
• Optimal nutrition and protein intake (at least 1.5 g/kg/d - 15%-20% of the total
caloric intake), regular exercise with resistance training may be instituted to
increase muscle strength and quality to prevent sarcopenia.881-883 (Level III)
› This reduces the risk of fall secondary to frailty.
• Regular assessment of medical, psychosocial, functional and social domains
is necessary.
› Annual screening with tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination,884
Mini-Cognitive,885 the Montreal Cognitive Assessment886 and the Clinical
Frailty Score887 (Level II) may help identify patients requiring neuropsychological
evaluation and referral to geriatrician, especially for those in whom
dementia is suspected.
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
• Other co-morbidities should also be treated to goal.
› Lipid-lowering therapy and aspirin therapy may benefit those with life
expectancies at least equal to the time frame of primary or secondary
prevention trials.

6.4 Diabetes in Ramadan
• Fasting during Ramadan is obligatory for all healthy adult Muslims.
• Ramadan fasting may have favourable physiological changes among healthy
individuals, such as decreased body weight and lipid profile.
• Fasting in certain individuals with diabetes may be associated with adverse
outcomes; hence they are not obliged to fast.
› However, many patients with diabetes choose to fast as shown in the
Epidemiology of Diabetes and Ramadan (EPIDIAR) study,888 (Level II-2) despite
a clear instruction from the Quran on individuals who are exempted from
fasting (Surah Al Baqarah Verse 184-185).
• Management of Muslim patients with T2DM during Ramadan continues to be
a challenge for healthcare professionals.889 (Level II-2)
• There are several potential risks associated with fasting in Ramadan namely
hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia/DKA, dehydration and thrombosis.
• It is important to categorise patients who intend to fast based on risk
stratification as listed in Appendix 11. Those in high- and very high-risk
categories should abstain from fasting.890,891(Level III)
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
Preparation prior Ramadan
• A pre-Ramadan medical assessment should be performed to categorise
patients in terms of risks of fasting as well as to optimise their management.
These include:
› general well-being,
› diabetes medications,
› glycaemic control,
› comorbidities; and
› complications.
• Patients and caregivers should receive education concerning self-care
regarding the following:892-894 (Level III)
› risks of adverse effect of fasting,
› SMBG,
› indications for termination of fasting,
› meal planning, food choices and fluid intake,
› exercise and physical activity; and
› modifications of glucose lowering medication (oral and in particular insulin).
• Risks of adverse effect of fasting
› There are several potential risks associated with prolonged fasting. It
is therefore important to increase patient awareness and to reduce
risks while, if possible, enabling patients to participate in their spiritual
experience of fasting during Ramadan.
› Adverse effects and risks associated with fasting include:
- hypoglycaemia, especially during the late period of fasting before iftar,
- severe hyperglycaemia after each of the main meals,
- dehydration,
- acute kidney injury in patients prone to dehydration, particularly elderly
patients and those with impaired kidney function.
• These diabetes-related risks can be minimised through education, appropriate
food choices and SMBG.
During Ramadan
A. Plasma glucose monitoring
• Patients are advised to monitor their plasma glucose and most importantly
when symptomatic of hypoglycaemia.
• The frequency of SMBG depends on risk factors and current medications.
› For those at moderate or low risk, this may be once or twice a day.
› Those at high or very high risk should check their plasma glucose levels
several times a day.
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
› Patients on insulin and/or SUs may need to monitor their plasma glucose
levels more frequently.
• The frequency of plasma glucose testing is dependent on the insulin regimen
and/or the risk of hypo- or hyperglycaemia.
B. Indications for termination of fasting (Refer to Table 6-3)
Table 6-3: Criteria to terminate fasting.
Plasma glucose (mmol/L)
Time of day
<3.3895 (Level II-2)
Anytime during fast

symptomatic of dehydration
Anytime during fast
Without SMBG (Level III)
When experiencing symptoms of
hypoglycaemia, or severe dehydration,
e.g. giddiness, syncope or confusion
C. Meal planning, food choices and fluid intake
• Recommendations for Sahur (pre-dawn meal)897 (Level III)
› Should never be omitted.
› Should consist of a balanced meal with adequate CHO.
› To be taken as late as possible, just before Imsak (dawn).
› Intake of salty foods should be avoided to reduce risk of dehydration.
• Recommendations for Iftar (breaking of fast at sunset)897 (Level III)
› It should not be delayed.
› Intake of high-sugar foods should be avoided. However, 1-2 kurma (dates)
at the start of Iftar following the practice of the Prophet (Sunnah) may be
taken as part of CHO exchange.
› Sufficient fluid should be taken to replenish fluid loss during the day. Aim
for 8 glasses of fluid a day.
› The main meal is encouraged after the performance of Maghrib prayers.
• Supper after Tarawih (supererogatory prayers) can be considered as a prebed snack.
D. Exercise and physical activity
• Physical activity and exercise need to be adjusted during Ramadan.
• The following are recommended:894,898 (Level III)
› light and moderate intensity exercise on a regular basis,
› avoid rigorous exercise during the day because of the risk of hypoglycaemia,
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
› the timing of exercise is preferably performed 1-2 hours after Iftar,
› performance of Tarawih prayers is a form of physical activity.
E. Modification of GLDs
• Glucose-lowering therapies should be individualised during fasting.889 (Level II-2)
• Glucose-lowering therapies of choice are those with low risk of hypoglycaemia
and do not require modification with regards to dose and timing of
administration.
• OGLDs:
› The preferred OGLDs are those which have low risk of hypoglycaemia.
› OGLDs which have been proven to be safe in Ramadan include:891,899 (Level III)
900 (Level II-2)
- Metformin
- Glimepiride
- Gliclazide
- Sitagliptin
- Vildagliptin901 (Level II-1)
› SGLT2-i902-905 has lower risk of hypoglycaemia, but are associated with some
safety concerns in particular, dehydration and should be used with caution
in patients with DKD ≥Stage 3.891 (Level III) 905 (Level II-3)
› The principles of OGLD modifications are:
- the non-fasting morning dose should be taken during Iftar, and the nonfasting evening dose should be taken during Sahur; and
- the dose of glucose-lowering agents may be maintained or reduced
depending on risk of hypoglycaemia.

this CPG’s committee.(Level III)
• Injectable glucose lowering therapies
› Liraglutide906 (Level II-1) and exenatide are safe as an add-on treatment to
metformin and can be effective in reducing weight and HbA1c levels during
Ramadan.
› Data relating to the use of newer GLP1-RAs (lixisenatide and dulaglutide)
during Ramadan are lacking.
› No dose modification is required, and injection should be given at Iftar.
• Insulin therapy
› Insulin use during prolonged fasting carries an increased risk of
hypoglycaemia.
› Use of insulin analogues is preferred over regular human insulin due to a
number of advantages that include less hypoglycaemia.
› Individualised adjustments of insulin dose and timing will need to be
implemented when fasting during Ramadan. In those who are prone to
developing hypoglycaemia, insulin analogues may be a better alternative.889
(Level II-2)

Post Ramadan visit
• A post-Ramadan follow-up meeting with HCPs is advisable in order to discuss
medication and regimen readjustments and assess how the patient handled
the fasting.
• It should be stressed to the patient that a safe fast one year does not
automatically make them a low risk for the next year due to the progressive
nature of the disease.
SECTION 6
T2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS
Recommendations: Management during Ramadan
4. SMBG recommended especially in patients on insulin
or SUs/meglitinides.
Grade C
1. A pre-Ramadan medical assessment of general
well-being, glycaemic control, comorbidities and
complications should be performed to categorise the
patient’s risk from fasting as well as to optimise their
managements.
Grade C
2. Patients and caregivers should receive education
concerning self-care on risks of hypoglycaemia,
hyperglycaemia and dehydration.
Grade C
3. Glucose lowering therapies should be individualised
during fasting – modification of medication may be
needed.
Grade C
5. Clear advice on when to terminate fasting should be
given e.g.in the event of severe hypoglycaemia or
during “sick day”.
Grade C
PREVENTION OF T2DM
SECTION 7
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• Individuals with pre-diabetes are at risk of progression to frank
diabetes and are also at higher CV risk.
• The mainstay of T2DM prevention is intensive behavioural lifestyle
intervention program to achieve target weight loss of at least 7%
(and improving insulin resistance).
• Metformin should be considered in those at very high risk,
prediabetes, previous history of GDM or for those who failed
lifestyle therapy after 6 months.
• Newer therapeutic agents, e.g. high dose liraglutide, in obese
prediabetic individuals have been shown to result in weight reduction
and delay progression to T2DM.
7.1 For people at risk
• There are many risk factors that predispose an individual or population to
developing glucose intolerance and eventually diabetes (Refer to Tables 2-1
& 2-2).
• There is ample evidence that lifestyle related changes as a result of rapid
urbanisation are influencing the explosion of T2DM. In particular weight gain
and a sedentary lifestyle.
• As T2DM is an endpoint in the glucose tolerance continuum, it is possible to
halt this slide from normal to IGT and subsequently T2DM.
7.2 For people with prediabetes
• Patients with IFG and/or IGT and/or HbA1c 5.7%-6.2% are considered as
having prediabetes.
• Prediabetes increases the risk of progression to T2DM. In addition, patients
with prediabetes have a higher risk of CVD.
SECTION 7
PREVENTION OF T2DM
• Progression to diabetes in patients with prediabetes can be delayed.
• Patients with prediabetes often have other CV risk factors, e.g. hypertension
and dyslipidaemia,911 and, are associated with increased CV risk.912 They
should be screened for presence of these modifiable CV risk factors, and
appropriate management instituted.
Interventions proven to reduce the conversion of IFG/IGT to T2DM
A. Lifestyle modifications
• Diet and moderate intensity physical activity remain the mainstay of
therapy.53,913-916 (Level I)
• There is strong evidence that combination of diet plus physical activity
reduces or delays the incidence of T2DM in prediabetes, particularly in IGT
patients.917 (Level I)
• Intensive behavioural lifestyle intervention program modelled on the
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) should be advocated for all prediabetic
patients to achieve moderate-intensity physical activity (such as brisk walking)
for at least 150 min/week and a target weight loss of at least 7%.6 (Level III)
• Based on intervention trials, Mediterranean, low-calorie, low-fat eating plans
may be beneficial for prediabetes with an emphasis on high dietary fibre,
whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits and vegetables, and minimal refined and
processed foods.6,918 (Level III)
• Interventions that use technology to disseminate diet and exercise lifestyle
programs have been shown to be effective in weight reduction and
improvements in glycaemic levels in patients with prediabetes and should be
considered as part of T2DM prevention strategy.6 (Level III) 919 (Level I)
• There is limited evidence on benefit of bariatric surgery on reduction of
progression to T2DM.920 (Level I) 921 (Level II-2)
B. Pharmacotherapy
• In addition to lifestyle intervention, metformin should be considered for
those at very high risk. These include those with:6,914,922 (Level I)
› combined IFG and IGT,
› IGT + obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2),
› IGT + <60 years old,
› FPG >6.1 mmol/L,
› HbA1c >6%,
› previous history of GDM; or
› for those who failed lifestyle therapy after 6 months (refer to Figures 3-3
and 3-4).
• Metformin reduces progression from prediabetes to T2DM by ~30%914,922 (Level I)
with persistent benefit, especially in women with previous GDM (overall risk
reduction 18%) over the 10 years of the DPP/DPPOS program.923 (Level II-2)
• Metformin is the only drug that has received endorsement by our Malaysian
Regulatory authority as well as by other national guidelines for the prevention
of T2DM.6,924
• Refer Table 7-1 for other pharmacological interventions that have been
shown to delay the onset of T2DM.
• There is no firm evidence that DPP-4i and SGLT-2i compared with placebo,
substantially influence the rate of progression to T2DM.925,926 (Level I)
Table 7-1: Pharmacological interventions proven to delay progression to
T2DM
Pharmacological
agents
May prevent/delay development of T2DM in:
Liraglutide925 (Level I)
Liraglutide 3mg/day delays progression to T2DM in
prediabetic patients with obesity (BMI >27 kg/m2 +
IGT, IFG, or HbA1c >5.7%)
AGIs927 (Level I)
May prevent or delay the development of T2DM in
people with IGT.
Pioglitazone928 (Level I)
Reduces the development of T2DM predominantly
in those with initial IFG and HbA1c of >5.7%.
Orlistat929 (Level I)
Beneficial in patients with IGT and BMI >28kg/m2 as
management of obesity for a minimum duration of
12 weeks.
T2DM: type 2 diabetes mellitus; BMI: body mass index; IGT: impaired glucose tolerance; IFG: impaired
fasting glucose; AGIs: alpha glucosidase inhibitors.
Recommendations: Prevention of T2DM
1. The mainstay of diabetes prevention is intensive
behavioural lifestyle intervention program to achieve
target weight loss of at least 7%.
Grade A
2. Metformin should be considered in those at very
high risk, prediabetes, previous history of GDM or for
those who failed lifestyle therapy after 6 months.
Grade A

COMPLEMENTARY AND
ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IN T2DM
8.1 Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
• Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is defined as healthcare
management outside of conventional medicine, with “complementary”
meaning used together with, and “alternative” meaning used in place of
conventional medicine.930
• The 2020 American Diabetes Association guidelines state that there is
insufficient evidence to recommend the daily use of supplements such as
chromium, vitamin D, cinnamon or herbs/supplement.6 (Level III)
• Many individuals with diabetes are hesitant to inform their healthcare
providers of their complementary therapy use.931 (Level III)
› Unfortunately, alternative therapies may contain harmful ingredients, may
be unsafe or may be improperly marketed as OTC products when they
should be marketed as prescription products.
• Healthcare providers are encouraged to enquire about the use of CAM in
people with diabetes.40 (Level III)
• It is very important to advise patients not to replace conventional medical
therapy for T2DM with an unproven alternative therapy.
› Patients need to be cautioned on the potential side effects, drug interactions
and lack of product standardisation.
SECTION 8
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of supplements
such as chromium, vitamin D, cinnamon or herbs/supplement.
• Alternative therapies may contain harmful ingredients, may be unsafe
or may be improperly marketed as over-the-counter (OTC) products.
• A recent prospective RCT assessing vitamin D supplementation
failed to slow progression of prediabetes to overt diabetes.
› In addition, the increased costs that patients may incur when they use
ineffective therapies or delay treatment with proven therapeutic agents.
• Natural health products which are unlabelled should not be used to avoid
intake of products that may be adulterated with pharmaceuticals or other
contaminants.40 (Level III)
• Medicines for T2DM and other health conditions may need to be adjusted if a
person is taking an alternative treatment as drug-herb interactions may occur.
Popular supplements and evidence of benefits
• Clear scientific evidence supporting the benefit from all herbal, vitamin
and other supplementations for treatment and prevention of T2DM remain
scarce.
› Olive oil: When taken as supplementation or part of a Mediterranean diet,
has demonstrated favourable effects in reducing the risk of development
of T2DM in prediabetes and improvement in glycaemic control in T2DM by
0.27%.932 (Level I)
› Vitamin D: Although earlier observational studies have shown an
association between low level of vitamin D and increased risk for T2DM,
however, a recent RCT study on vitamin D supplementation failed to delay
progression to T2DM.933 (Level I)
› Vitamin E,934 (Level I) cinnamon,935 (Level I) curcumin:936 (Level I) These have no
significant benefit on glycaemic control in patients with T2DM.
Note on acupuncture: Acupuncture has not been shown to improve glycaemic control in patients with
T2DM.
8.2 Reporting adverse events
• Healthcare professionals and consumers are encouraged to report any
adverse events related to products intended to treat or cure diabetes to the
Malaysian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (MADRAC) at www.
npra.gov.my/index.php/en/health-professionals/reporting-adr 937
Recommendations: Complementary and alternative therapy
1. Healthcare providers should enquire about the use of
CAM therapies in patients with prediabetes and T2DM.
Grade C
2. Benefits from all herbal, vitamin and other
supplementations for treatment and prevention
of T2DM remain unclear.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
9.1 Guide to Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
• Over the years, the MOH has been monitoring processes and key indicators
(clinical and biochemical) – particularly in the public sector.
• The priority should be on coordinated care to maximise use of limited
resources.
• To analyse clinical outcomes that matter:
› the data should be collected and expressed as “outcomes per population”
by region (district, state, specified geographical region, national).
› results will allow for future re-strategizing where discrepancies and
imbalances exist. This is important for sharing of best practices that
contribute to achieving higher standards of care particularly in regions
performing below average.
› interventions to promote patient centred multi-level care (between
primary and secondary care; between different disciplines; between
private and public).
• The data collected should include parameters that fulfil the following:
› key clinical outcomes,
› easy to collect; and
› collected without the intervention of the direct stakeholders.
SECTION 9
SUMMARY OF UPDATES
• This section has been revamped and focuses on key performance
indicators for management of T2DM.
• Two measures specific for KPIs and 3 measures for baseline data
collection have been introduced.
• The results will allow for future re-strategizing where discrepancies
and imbalances exist. It will also allow for sharing of best practices
contributing to achieving higher standards of care.

ASSESSMENT PRIOR TO INTENSE EXERCISE
APPENDIX 5
General
assessment
• Elicit careful history and assess CV risk factors.
• Assess for conditions that might contraindicate certain
types of exercise or predispose to injury.
• Patient’s age and previous physical activity level
should be considered to customise exercise regimens
according to individual needs.
CVD
• CV assessment should include a full history for CV
symptoms. Where there is concern, referral to a
cardiologist for further assessment is recommended.
• There is no evidence of benefit for screening of
asymptomatic patients, and adverse events are rare.
› In these patients, the most sensible approach is often
to start with short periods of low-intensity exercise,
and to increase both the intensity and the duration of
exercise slowly.
• CV assessment is recommended for patients
with autonomic neuropathy and/or albuminuria
(microalbuminuria/macroalbuminuria)
Peripheral
neuropathy
• For patients with peripheral neuropathy, it is vital to
ensure that appropriate footwear is worn and feet are
examined regularly.
• Weight-bearing exercise should be avoided in those
with active foot disease and severe neuropathy, but
moderate intensity walking may not increase the
risk of ulceration and improves outcomes in milder
neuropathy.
Retinopathy
• Avoid vigorous intensity aerobic or resistance exercise
in presence of proliferative (or severe non-proliferative)
retinopathy because of the risk of vitreous
haemorrhage or retinal detachment.
• Consultation with an ophthalmologist prior to engaging
in an intensive exercise regimen may be appropriate.
DKD
• There is no evidence for specific restriction of exercise.
• Importantly, CVD is increased in individuals with
albuminuria/DKD, so CV assessment is recommended
prior to exercise.
Plasma glucose
• Check plasma glucose before exercise.
• If pre-exercise plasma glucose is low normal
(<5.6 mmol/L), advisable to take extra CHO before
exercise. This may not be necessary for short duration
exercise or for those who are not taking insulin or
insulin secretagogues.
CVD: cardiovascular disease; CV: cardiovascular; DKD: diabetic kidney disease; CHO: carbohydrate.

Metabolic equivalent targets (METS) are defined as:
Moderate Intensity: 50%-70% of a person’s maximum heart rate. (3.0-5.9 METs)
Vigorous / Strenuous Intensity: >70% of a person’s maximum heart rate. (≥6.0 METs)
The ratio of exercise metabolic rate. One MET is defined as the energy expenditure for sitting quietly,
which, for the average adult, approximates 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per
minute (1.2 kcal/min for a 70-kg individual). For example, a 2-MET activity requires two times the
metabolic energy expenditure of sitting quietly.
Muscle strengthening exercise or resistance exercise
Activities to increase muscle strength and endurance for minimum of 3 times
per week:
• Should be progressive
• Involving major muscle groups
• Repetitive
• e.g. Lifting weights – dumbbells or barbells

APPENDIX 7
DOSAGE OF GLUCOSE LOWERING DRUGS IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)
Insulin
Doses should be adjusted based on frequent monitoring to balance goals of glycaemic
control with avoiding hypoglycaemia. Long-acting tends to accumulate longer than
short-acting insulin.
Dose escalation will depend on tolerability and according to the PI.
GFR in ml/min/1.73 m2; *usual dose not maximum dose.
^ Sulphonylureas should be used cautiously because of the increased risk of hypoglycaemia. First generation
sulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide): generally, should be avoided due to long half-life and risk of
hypoglycaemia in patients with CKD. Gliclazide and glipizide are the preferred agents among the secondgeneration sulphonylureas as they do not have active metabolites and have lower risk of hypoglycaemia
in CKD patients.
§ Metformin is eliminated via kidney and may accumulate in body as kidney function deteriorates, increase
risk of lactic acidosis.
¶SGLT2-i – eGFR below which this class of agents can be prescibed is expected to change, with the advent
of their significant reno-protective and cardio-protective benefits; however, the indication may be for
their reno and cardio-protective benefits rather than specifically for glucose lowering. At lower eGFR,
glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT2-i are modest. Shown here are cut-offs based on individual agents’
registered indication in Malaysia.
CKD: chronic kidney disease; OD: daily; BD: twice daily; TDS: three times daily; GFR: glomerular filtration
rate; DPP4-i: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; GLP1-RA: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists;
SGLT2-i: sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors.

APPENDIX 11
IDF-DAR RISK CATEGORIES FOR PATIENTS WITH T2DM WHO FAST DURING RAMADAN
ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT OF TOBACCO
USE DISORDER
APPENDIX 12
ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT
1.
Ask and document smoking status for all patients.
2.
Provide brief advice on quit smoking at every visit to all smokers.
3.
Assess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerström Test for Cigarette
Dependence Questionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using
carbon monoxide (CO) breath analyser (IF AVAILABLE).
4.
Offer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless
contraindicated.
5.
If selected, use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for at least eight to twelve
weeks, whereas varenicline should be used for at least twelve weeks.
6.
Combination therapy (e.g. two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g. bupropion with an NRT)
is better than monotherapy in smoking cessation treatment and may be most
useful for those smokers at highest risk of relapse.
7.
Use smoking cessation medications with caution in special populations (e.g.
children and adolescents, pregnant, breastfeeding women, psychiatric and
substance abuse disorder patients).
8.
Arrange a minimum of six to eight face to face follow-up sessions for smoking
cessation interventions in six months through counselling support team (health
education officer, pharmacists or any officer trained for quit smoking services).
