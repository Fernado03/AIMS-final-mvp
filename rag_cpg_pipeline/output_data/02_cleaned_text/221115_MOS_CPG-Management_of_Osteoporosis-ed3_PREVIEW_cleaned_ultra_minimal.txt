MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
This revision of the Clinical Guidance on Management of Osteoporosis is
now titled as the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on Management of
Osteoporosis. The recommendation in this 3rd edition CPG supersedes the
previous Clinical Guidance on Management of Osteoporosis 2015.
STATEMENT OF INTENT
These guidelines are meant for the clinical management of osteoporosis, based
on the best available evidence at the time of development. Adherence to the
guidelines may not necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case.
Every healthcare provider is responsible for the individualised management of
his/her patient based on the patient’s presentation and management options
available locally.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES
These guidelines issued in June 2022 will be reviewed in 5 years (2027) or sooner,
if new evidence become available.

FOREWORD
DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH, MALAYSIA
Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah
Osteoporotic hip fractures, the worst fragility fracture, are associated with significant
disability, morbidity and mortality. Around one-quarter of those who have sustained
a hip fracture will not survive beyond 12 months. The International Osteoporosis
Foundation has projected that more than half of all osteoporotic hip fractures will
occur in Asia by the year 2050. Among the country states of the Asian Federation of
Osteoporosis Societies, Malaysia is predicted to have the fastest increase of hip
fractures over the coming three decades as we approach the status of an aged nation
earlier than projected.
Osteoporosis is a chronic disease closely linked with age. Despite its wide prevalence,
osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Its complication, fragility
fractures, is a significant disease burden to the healthcare system and its resources.
Hence, those at risk for osteoporosis should be screened to prevent the onset of a first
osteoporotic fracture. In addition, those who have already sustained an osteoporotic
fracture should receive the necessary treatment to prevent a recurrence, either with
effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies.
The 3rd Edition of the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for managing osteoporosis will
reflect best practices and the latest evidence on the management of osteoporosis. It
is a condition that crosses traditional speciality boundaries such as endocrinology,
rheumatology, orthopaedics, geriatric medicine, family medicine, and rehabilitation.
Healthcare professionals such as dietetics and pharmacy are critical in managing
osteoporosis. This CPG will be a valuable resource for all healthcare professionals as it
covers all aspects of osteoporosis care from identification, diagnosis, risk stratification,
treatment, and fracture prevention.
The Ministry of Health congratulates the chairs and the CPG Working Group members
for their hard work and believes that this document will further elevate the standard
of osteoporosis care and reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures in our country.

PREFACE
CHAIRPERSONS FOR THE CPG WRITING COMMITTEE
With the increasing proportion of older persons in the population, osteoporosis and
osteoporotic fractures are growing public health problems worldwide as well as in
Malaysia. Thus, to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with
osteoporosis, it is important to treat patients early and effectively. We hope that this
practical and evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of
Osteoporosis will be useful in that respect.
Since the last CPG revision in 2015, there have been conceptual changes in fracture
risk assessment as well as new therapeutic options available. Thus, it is timely that
the Malaysian Osteoporosis Society has taken the lead in getting the CPG updated to
reflect what should be current best practice. Once again, a multi-speciality panel of
experts have come together to form the CPG Working Group, to thoroughly review the
literature and produce this latest edition. As with all CPGs, this is not intended to be a
fully comprehensive textbook, but a practical guide for clinicians on the latest approach
to the assessment, investigation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with osteoporosis,
taking into account the availability and accessibility of health care resources.
We would like to thank all the members of the CPG Working Group for their valuable
contribution and the external reviewers for their helpful feedback. We hope that the
CPG will be useful to all medical practitioners involved in the care of patients with
osteoporosis.

Guidelines’ development
The guidelines development writing committee consisted of rheumatologists,
endocrinologists, orthopaedic surgeons, geriatricians, a dietitian, an obstetrician &
gynaecologist, and a family medicine specialist.
The previous edition of these guidelines was referred to as “Clinical Guidance”. Though
it was used as the basis for the development of this document, the writing committee
decided to designate these updated recommendations as “Clinical Practice Guidelines”.
Literature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: PUBMED,
Medline, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and OVID. In addition,
the reference lists of relevant articles were searched to identify further studies.
Reference was also made to the latest edition of other guidelines on the management
of osteoporosis including the guidelines developed by the International Osteoporosis
Foundation (IOF), European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis,
Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO), International Society for Clinical
Densitometry (ISCD), World Health Organization (WHO), and National Osteoporosis
Foundation (NOF).
Clinical questions were assigned to individual authors. All retrieved literature were
critically appraised, presented and discussed. The writing committee agreed with
all statements and recommendations. Where the evidence was insufficient, the
recommendations were derived by consensus of the committee.
The articles were graded using the SIGN50 format that includes criteria for the levels of
evidence and grades of recommendations.
The draft guidelines as a whole were submitted for external review to experts in
endocrinology, rheumatology, geriatrics, family medicine, general practice and a layperson. These guidelines were then presented to the Technical Advisory Committee
for Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Health Technology Assessment and Clinical
Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for review and approval.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
Objectives
The aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations to assist
healthcare providers in the identification, diagnosis and management of patients with
osteoporosis.
The overarching principle in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis should be to
aim at the best care and must be based on a shared decision between the patient and
the treating doctor.
Clinical questions
1. In adults, what are the predisposing risk factors for osteoporosis or low bone
mineral density?
2. In adults, how is osteoporosis diagnosed?
3. In adults with suspected osteoporosis, what specific investigational modalities will
diagnose osteoporosis?
4. In adults with osteoporosis, what are the risk assessment tools available to
determine their risk of sustaining an osteoporotic fracture?
5. In adults with osteoporosis on treatment, how can adherence to, and efficacy of
treatment be monitored?
6. In adults at risk of or with osteoporosis, are calcium and vitamin D effective for
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis?
7. In adults at risk of osteoporosis, what are the life-style measures that can effectively
prevent progression to osteoporosis?
8. In adults at risk of osteoporosis, does exercise prevent progression to osteoporosis
and risk of falls?
9. In adults with osteoporosis, what are the effective methods for falls prevention?
10. In adults with osteoporosis, what is the ideal time for initiating treatment?
11. In adults with osteoporosis, what are the effective treatment modalities for
improving bone mineral density and reducing fracture risk?
12. In adults with osteoporosis and on treatment, particularly bisphosphonates, how
would their adverse events affect treatment?

14. In adults with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, what are the management
approaches to increase bone mineral density and reduce fracture risk?
15. In adults with osteoporosis and renal impairment, what are the special precautions
required when treating their low bone mineral density?
16. In adult men with risk of osteoporosis or with osteoporosis, what are the diagnostic
and treatment pathways available to improve their bone mineral density and
reduce their fracture risk?
17. In adults who have had an osteoporotic fracture, how does a Fracture Liaison
Service improve care following treatment of the acute fracture?

KEY STATEMENTS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
A clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made after a low-trauma (equivalent to a fall
from standing height or less) spine or hip fracture (regardless of bone mineral density).
GRADE C
Osteoporosis is diagnosed based on a T-score of -2.5 or lower on bone mineral density
(BMD) measurement by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the femoral neck,
total hip, or lumbar spine.
GRADE A
Screening for osteoporosis is recommended for individuals with prior low-trauma
fractures, those with clinical risk factors, secondary osteoporosis, height loss and falls
risk, and for all postmenopausal women ≥50 years old.
GRADE D ☑
Appropriate investigations are recommended to confirm the diagnosis of osteoporosis,
determine its severity, exclude secondary causes, and to guide treatment.
GRADE D ☑
BMD measurement with DXA remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
GRADE D ☑
The use of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment
in osteoporosis is not recommended.
GRADE D ☑
Bone turnover markers (BTM) are useful for clinical monitoring of treatment response
and assessment of adherence to treatment.
GRADE D ☑
All patients commenced on active anti-osteoporosis therapy should be assessed for
response to treatment.
GRADE D ☑
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
Adequate calcium and vitamin D is important for peak bone mass attainment and
osteoporosis prevention in adults.
GRADE A
Regular physical activity, in particular weight-bearing exercise is encouraged in all age
groups to maximise peak bone mass, decrease age-related bone loss, maintain muscle
strength and balance.
GRADE C
Exercise and physical therapy are recommended to prevent falls and injuries from falls.
GRADE A
All older persons ≥65 years old should be screened at least once a year for their risk of
falls.
GRADE B
Those at risk of falls should receive a multifactorial falls risk assessment and
intervention.
GRADE A
Hip protectors used in care home residents can reduce the risk of hip fractures.
GRADE B
All individuals with osteoporosis should have optimisation of their calcium and vitamin
D intake and life-style intervention together with pharmacological therapy.
GRADE A
Very high-risk individuals should be considered for treatment with an anabolic agent if
available. Other alternatives (in order of preference) include denosumab or parenteral
bisphosphonates.
GRADE B
High-risk individuals should be treated with anti-resorptives (e.g. bisphosphonates or
denosumab).
GRADE A
Low-risk individuals should be considered for menopausal hormone replacement or
selective estrogen receptor modulators, if clinically indicated.

Menopausal hormone therapy offered to symptomatic women <60-years-old and
within 10 years of menopause helps prevent and treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.
GRADE A
Women who are one year past their last period may be offered tibolone for the relief of
menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis.
GRADE A
Raloxifene may be recommended for postmenopausal osteoporosis as it reduces new
vertebral fractures in women with or without prior fractures.
GRADE A
KEY STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for osteoporosis. The overall risk-benefit
ratio of treatment with bisphosphonates for osteoporosis is positive.
GRADE A
Oral bisphosphonates are not recommended for patients with an eGFR <30 ml/min
(chronic kidney disease stage 4-5).
GRADE D ☑
Zoledronic acid is contraindicated in patients with eGFR <35 ml/min.
GRADE A
It is recommended to review the efficacy of bisphosphonate treatment after 3-5 years.
Continuation of treatment would depend on the treatment response, occurrence of
side effects, and future fracture risk.
GRADE D ☑
Recombinant parathyroid hormone (r-PTH/teriparatide) is indicated for individuals
with very high risk for fractures or osteoporosis not responding to treatment.
GRADE A
Denosumab is an effective anti-resorptive treatment for osteoporosis especially for
those at high risk of osteoporotic fractures.
GRADE A
A denosumab ‘drug holiday’ is not recommended due to an associated rebound
increase in bone turnover and increased risk of multiple vertebral fractures (especially
in those at high risk of osteoporotic fractures) when the drug is discontinued.
GRADE B
Treatment reassessment may be done after 5-10 years and those who remain at high
fracture risk should either continue denosumab or be switched to other osteoporosis
therapies.
GRADE D ☑
If denosumab is stopped, subsequent treatment with another treatment option should
be initiated to prevent the rebound increase in bone turnover seen with denosumab
withdrawal.
GRADE D ☑
KEY STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
Romozusomab is an anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis especially in
patients with a very high fracture risk; preferably in those with low cardiovascular
(CV) risk.
GRADE A
Romosozumab is currently not recommended in patients with a history of a CV event
within the past one year, and should be used cautiously in patients with high CV risk
and only when benefits outweigh risks.
GRADE B
Vitamin D supplementation (at least 800 IU/day) in combination with calcium (1200 mg/
day elemental calcium) is recommended for fracture and fall prevention in people
above 50 years of age who are at risk of fractures, particularly when initiating active
osteoporosis therapies.
GRADE A
Treatment failure can be considered when two or more osteoporotic fractures occur
and/or <25% change in BTM and/or worsening BMD during treatment.
GRADE C
Before considering treatment changes, patients need to be assessed for treatment
adherence, and for the possibility of secondary osteoporosis.
GRADE B
Osteoporotic hip fractures are best treated by early (<48 hours) surgical intervention.
GRADE B
Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be initially treated conservatively; vertebral
augmentation procedures can be considered in specific circumstances if conservative
treatment fails.
GRADE A
All patients starting glucocorticoids and in whom it is anticipated that they will be
continuing for more than three months should have an initial fracture risk assessment.
GRADE D ☑
KEY STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
The presence of a previous fragility fracture, BMD measurement by DXA and the
glucocorticoid-adjusted Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) scores are used to
assess fracture risk in patients on glucocorticoids.
GRADE D ☑
For patients on glucocorticoids with osteoporotic fractures, densitometric osteoporosis
and/or very high fracture risk, oral bisphosphonates are the first line treatment.

INTRODUCTION
SECTION 1:
Osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder characterised by compromised bone
strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. Bone strength reflects
the integration of bone density and bone quality. Bone density (g/cm2 or g/cm3) is
determined by peak bone mass and amount of bone loss. Bone quality refers to the
architecture, turnover, damage accumulation, and mineralisation of the bone.1
Osteoporosis-related fractures have been recognised as a major health problem in the
elderly. Similar to trends in many countries with increasing life expectancy, Malaysia is
expected to have a growing number of elderly individuals. The common sites of fracture
are the spine, wrist and hip. Hip fractures are associated with high morbidity and a
mortality rate of up to 20% in the first year. Majority of those who survive are disabled
and only 25% will resume normal activities.2,3
In 1997, the incidence of hip fracture in Malaysia among individuals above 50 years of
age was 90 per 100,000. There was a marked increase in the incidence among the older
age group. The incidence of hip fracture is consistently higher in women (Table 1-1).4,5

In our community, the Chinese had the highest incidence of hip fractures compared to
the Malays and Indians. Chinese women accounted for 44.8% of hip fractures.4
The direct hospitalisation cost for hip fractures in 1997 is estimated at RM 22 million
and it has been projected to increase to USD 125.4 million by 2050.6 This is a gross
underestimation of the total economic burden, as it does not take into account the
costs incurred for rehabilitation and long-term nursing care. Therefore, in an ageing
population, the cost of treating hip fractures will escalate without appropriate
intervention.4
It has been proven that an osteoporotic fracture begets another fracture.7 This simply
means that if a patient has a fracture, the risk of getting a second osteoporotic fracture
in the following year is more than double the general population.8 Hence, appropriate
assessment and treatment after the first osteoporotic fracture is vital to prevent the
second and subsequent fractures. To improve osteoporosis treatment and fracture
prevention, the Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) has been started in hospitals in various
countries. FLS encompasses a multidisciplinary team approach to manage patients
with osteoporosis and also encourage the patients’ siblings and the next generation
to start on individual osteoporotic prevention strategies to reduce their risk of fracture
(see more in Section 9).

2.3 Risk factors for osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a silent disease without any symptoms in most patients until fractures
have occurred. Identification of risk factors will help in case finding.9 [Grade D, Level 4]
The major risk factors associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture in
postmenopausal women are shown in Table 2-2.

Non-modifiable
Modifiable
1. Advancing age
2. Ethnic group (Oriental & Caucasian)
3. Female gender
4. Premature menopause (<45 years)
including surgical menopause
5. Family history of osteoporotic hip
fracture in first degree relatives
6. Personal history of fracture as an
adult
1. Low calcium and/or vitamin D intake
2. Sedentary lifestyle
3. Cigarette smoking
4. Excessive alcohol intake (≥3 units/
day)

day)
6. Low body weight (body mass index
<19 kg/m2)
7. Estrogen deficiency
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
DIAGNOSIS
SECTION 3:
3.1 Clinical presentation
Most patients are asymptomatic, and diagnosis is made only after a fracture. Common
clinical presentations include:
• Increasing dorsal kyphosis (Dowager’s hump)
• A low-trauma fracture, i.e.
- After a fall from standing height or less11
- Fractures occurring at the site of a typical osteoporotic fracture,12 i.e. at the hip*,
spine*, forearm*, humerus, ribs, tibia (excluding ankle), pelvis and other femoral
fractures
• Historical height loss of >4cm (>1.5 inches)13
• Acute back pain following seemingly innocuous activities, e.g. bending, lifting
objects, coughing or sneezing14,15
*Most frequent site(s) of osteoporotic fractures.
3.2 Diagnosis
Recommendations
• A clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made after a low-trauma
(equivalent to a fall from standing height or less) spine or hip fracture
(regardless of bone mineral density)
• Osteoporosis is diagnosed based on a T-score of -2.5 or lower
on bone mineral density measurement by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry at the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine
Grade C
Grade A
3.2.1 Clinical diagnosis
Osteoporosis can be diagnosed based on clinical presentation where there is a lowtrauma fracture (i.e. fragility fracture) in the absence of other metabolic bone disease
and where bone mineral density (BMD) assessment may not be feasible or appropriate.
A fragility fracture is one that occurs after a fall from standing height or less. Hence, in
this situation, treatment should still be initiated.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS
3.2.2 Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement
BMD measurement via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the femoral neck,
total hip or lumbar spine remains the gold standard recommendation for the diagnosis
of osteoporosis.13,16-18 All patients should have BMD at the lumbar spine (L1-L4, posteroanterior) and hip (to include the femoral neck or total hip) measured. Forearm BMD
(1/3rd radius of the non-dominant forearm) should be measured when the hip and/or
spine cannot be measured or interpreted, in patients with hyperparathyroidism, and/
or in very obese patients (over the weight limit for the DXA table).19 BMD measurement
is also used for determining fracture risk and treatment decisions (see Section 5.2 Risk
stratification).
BMD is reported as a T-score or Z-score, both of which are units of standard deviation
(SD).
T-score
The T-score represents the number of SDs by which an individual’s BMD diverges
from the mean value of young female adults. The recommended reference range* for
determining the T-score is the United States of America Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (US CDC NHANES) III
database for femoral neck measurements in women aged 20-29 years.20
This classification does not apply to premenopausal women, men <50 years old, and
children.
*Recommendations from the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF), European Society for Clinical
and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO), International
Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD), World Health Organization (WHO), and National Osteoporosis
Foundation (NOF).

Z-score
The Z-score describes the number of SDs by which the BMD in an individual differs from
the mean value expected for age and sex. The Z-score should be used for premenopausal
women, men <50 years old and children.

3.3 Screening
Recommendation
• Screening for osteoporosis is recommended for individuals
with prior low-trauma fractures, those with clinical risk factors,
secondary osteoporosis, height loss and falls risk, and for all
postmenopausal women ≥50 years old
Grade D ☑
Evaluation for the risk of osteoporosis is recommended for all postmenopausal women
≥50 years old and should include detailed history, physical examination and clinical
fracture risk assessment with the Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX®) or other tools (see
Section 5.2 Risk stratification).13,21
Medical history and physical examination findings suggestive of an increased risk of
osteoporosis include:13
• Prior fracture (of the hip, spine, forearm, humerus, ribs, tibia excluding the ankle,
pelvis and other femoral fractures) without major trauma (after the age of 50 years)12
• Clinical risk factors (see Table 2-2)
• Secondary osteoporosis (see Table 2-1)
• Height loss or kyphosis
• Risk factors for falling
Evidence from the SCOOP (Screening for Prevention of Fractures In Older Women)
study,22 a randomised controlled trial involving a community-based screening
programme in the United Kingdom demonstrated that the screening of 1000 female
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS
patients aged 70-85 years old prevented nine hip fractures and 20 non-hip fractures
over the remaining lifetime (mean of 14 years) compared to usual management. Overall,
costs were saved and there was a gain in quality adjusted life-years (QALYs).
3.3.1 Tools for risk assessment
An effective osteoporosis screening tool will be able to reduce the need for DXA
scans by prioritising patients at high risk of osteoporosis. Clinical risk assessment
tools have been shown to be moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis
and osteoporotic fractures. These include23 the Simple Calculated Osteoporosis
Risk Estimation (SCORE; Merck), Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI),
Osteoporosis Index of Risk (OSIRIS), Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST), and the
Malaysian Osteoporosis Screening Tool (MOST).
If available, the use of country-specific fracture risk assessment should be a standard
component of investigation to evaluate bone health and predict future fracture and/
or osteoporosis risk.24 In Malaysia, we can use FRAX® for fracture risk assessment, and/
or the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) and MOST as osteoporosis
screening tools.
Most of these tools were designed to be used in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis
screening tools to guide further investigation and management for men have been
developed as well. These include the Male Osteoporosis Risk Estimation Score,336 the
Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Men337 and the Male Osteoporosis Screening
Tool.338 The Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool and the Male Osteoporosis Screening
Tool have been evaluated in a Chinese cohort338 demonstrating efficacy in ruling out
osteoporosis.
Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (Available at https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX/)
FRAX® estimates the 10-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture
(hip, clinical spine, proximal humerus, or forearm), for untreated patients between
ages 40 to 90 years using clinical risk factors which include an individual’s age, sex,
weight, height, prior fracture, parental history of hip fracture, smoking, long-term use of
glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis and alcohol consumption.25,26
The country-specific FRAX® prediction algorithms are available for some countries but
not for Malaysia. For Malaysians, we recommend the use of ethnic specific algorithms
(e.g. Singapore Chinese or Hong Kong Chinese, Singapore Malay and Singapore Indian)
until local data is available.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS
BMD is not necessary for calculation of fracture probability. However, it improves the
prediction of fracture probability. If a BMD is available, only the femoral neck BMD is
to be used. BMD input from non-hip sites has not been validated with FRAX® and is,
therefore, not recommended.26
The treatment interventions in FRAX® have been partly based on cost-effectiveness,
for which there is no Malaysian data. Notwithstanding that, we would propose that in
patients with osteopenia, initiation of treatment is recommended with a FRAX® (or if
available, trabecular bone score [TBS]-adjusted FRAX®) fracture probability of >3%
at 10 years for hip or 20% at 10 years for major osteoporosis-related fracture.13
FRAX® scores need to be adjusted for glucocorticoid usage – see Table 7-2. For patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), rheumatoid arthritis may be entered into
the FRAX® algorithm as a surrogate for fracture risk associated T2DM. Additionally,
adjusting FRAX® scores using TBS could be a useful tool for this population.13
Malaysian Osteoporosis Screening Tool
MOST calculates the risk of low BMD among women based on age, years since
menopause, body mass index (BMI) and hip circumference.27 It performed well among
women (cut-off value ≥4; sensitivity 80.2% and specificity 55.5%) but cannot be used in
men.27 Therefore, there is a paucity of local screening algorithms suitable for Malaysian
men and women.28
Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians
OSTA is a simple clinical screening tool that is based on age and weight developed for
postmenopausal Asian women. Women in the moderate-to-high-risk categories with
additional risk factors (see Table 2-2) for osteoporosis should be recommended for
DXA.29
A meta-analysis of 3 large randomised studies involving a total of 42,009 individuals
demonstrated that screening using fracture risk assessment tools (e.g. FRAX®) in
women ≥65 years old is effective in reducing osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures,
and should be implemented as a prevention strategy.30
Measurement of BMD using central DXA should be considered in those found to be
at increased risk of fracture13 (see Section 3.5.1 Densitometry and Appendix 1 for the
OSTA chart31).

3.4 Investigations
Recommendation
• Appropriate investigations are recommended to confirm the
diagnosis of osteoporosis, determine its severity, exclude
secondary causes, and to guide treatment
Grade D ☑
The main aims of investigations are to:13,17 [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
• Confirm the diagnosis of osteoporosis
• Exclude conditions that can mimic osteoporosis (e.g. osteomalacia and multiple
myeloma)
• Assess fracture risk and severity of osteoporosis
• Exclude
secondary
causes
where
appropriate,
e.g.
hyperthyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism, Cushing syndrome and hypogonadism
• Determine the most effective osteoporosis treatment
• Determine the baseline measurements for monitoring of treatment response
Appropriate initial investigations are indicated in all patients with postmenopausal
osteoporosis. This is to detect any co-existing medical conditions that may
cause bone loss as some of these conditions may be asymptomatic (e.g. primary
hyperparathyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism).13 [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]

Additional investigations that may be indicated on clinical suspicion of
secondary causes (see Table 2-1) including:
Thyroid function test
Intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH)
Serum protein electrophoresis and free kappa and lambda light chains
Morning serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
luteinizing hormone (LH)
24-hour urine calcium and creatinine
Routine plain x-rays are not recommended as radiological osteopenia is apparent in
plain X-rays only after >30% of bone loss has occurred.32
3.5 Special investigations
Recommendations
• Bone mineral density measurement with dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry remains the gold standard for diagnosis of
osteoporosis
• The use of quantitative ultrasound in the diagnosis and monitoring
of treatment in osteoporosis is not recommended
• Bone turnover markers are useful for clinical monitoring of
treatment response and assessment of adherence to treatment.

3.5.1 Densitometry
T-score determination via the quantified measurement of BMD using DXA is the
accepted method for diagnosing osteoporosis (see Section 3.2.1 BMD measurement).
BMD values are also used to establish fracture risk and, determine and monitor
management. BMD is still used to establish fracture risk even though ample data show
that many patients experiencing fragility fractures do not have a T-score indicating
osteoporotic bone density.19
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS
Indications for BMD testing19
• All adults (≥18 years old) with a fragility fracture
• All adults (≥18 years old) with a disease, condition or taking medications associated
with low bone mass or bone loss
• Anyone being considered for pharmacological therapy for osteoporosis
• Those being treated for osteoporosis and to monitor treatment effect
• Anyone not receiving therapy but with evidence of bone loss that would lead to
treatment
• All women who are aged ≥65 years and in men aged ≥70 years
• Postmenopausal women <65 years old, women during the menopausal transition,
women discontinuing estrogen, and in men <70 years old with clinical risk factors for
fracture
Reference database for T-scores19
Both the IOF17 and the ISCD19 have recommended the use of a Caucasian female
normative database for women and men in the calculation of T-scores. However,
studies from Malaysia33 and other Asian countries34-36 have consistently shown that
using a Caucasian database would lead to a higher incidence, thus, resulting in an
overestimation of densitometric osteoporosis. Therefore, the Asian database is the
default reference dataset for DXA machines in Malaysia.
Central DXA for diagnosis19
The WHO international reference standard for osteoporosis diagnosis is a T-score
of ≤-2.5 at the femoral neck. In postmenopausal women and men ≥50 years old,
osteoporosis may be diagnosed if the T-score of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral
neck is ≤-2.5. In certain circumstances the 33% radius (1/3rd radius) may be utilised.
Other hip regions of interest, including Ward’s area and the greater trochanter, should
not be used for diagnosis.
(See Appendix 2 for further details of the different skeletal sites to measure).
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS
Reporting BMD scores19
For BMD reporting in postmenopausal women and men ≥50 years old, T-scores are
preferred and the WHO densitometric classification is applicable (see Table 3-1). In
females prior to menopause and in men <50 years old, Z-scores are preferred (see Table
3-2) and is particularly important in children. BMD alone cannot be used to diagnose
osteoporosis in men <50 years old whilst the WHO diagnostic criteria may be applied to
women in menopausal transition.
Serial BMD measurements19
Serial BMD measurements can be utilised to:
• Determine the need of treatment initiation in untreated patients in combination with
clinical assessment of fracture risk, bone turnover markers (BTM), height loss and TBS
• To monitor response to therapy by determining an increase or stability of bone
density, and in individuals following cessation of osteoporosis pharmacologic therapy
• To detect loss of bone density which indicates need for assessment of treatment
adherence, evaluation of secondary cause of osteoporosis and re-evaluation of
treatment options
Follow-up BMD testing should be done when the results are likely to influence patient
management (see Section 3.6).
3.5.2 Trabecular bone score (TBS)
TBS is an analytical tool that evaluates pixel grey-level variations on a lumbar spine
DXA image. It captures information relating to the trabecular microarchitecture.37
TBS is associated with vertebral, hip, and major osteoporotic fracture risk in
postmenopausal women, hip and major osteoporotic fracture risk in men >50 years
old, and major osteoporotic fracture risk in postmenopausal women with T2DM.19
It can be used in association with FRAX® and BMD to adjust the FRAX®-probability of
fracture in postmenopausal women and older men. TBS should not be used alone to
determine treatment recommendations in clinical practice.19 [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
In patients receiving anti-fracture therapy, the role of TBS in monitoring anti-responsive
therapy is unclear but is potentially useful for monitoring anabolic therapy.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS
3.5.3 Quantitative ultrasound (QUS)
The use of QUS in diagnosing and treatment monitoring of osteoporosis is not
recommended. [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
Issues with this assessment modality include the diversity of techniques used, the lack
of standardisation and unavailability of comparable local normal ranges. However,
QUS appears to be a good predictor of fracture in postmenopausal women (hip,
vertebral and global fracture risk) and men ≥65 years old (hip and all non-vertebral
fracture risk) independent of central DXA BMD.19
The criteria for diagnosis, and recommending and monitoring treatment based on QUS
are not well established.38-40
Women with low QUS results should be referred for BMD measurement. [Grade D,

3.5.4 Bone turnover markers (BTM)
BTM are by-products produced from the bone re-modelling process and are indicative
of the rate of bone turnover.41 They can be measured in the urine and serum, and are
classified as markers of bone formation or bone resorption (see Table 3-4).

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS
BTM levels show significant and rapid response to changes in turnover rates in response
to treatment, compared to treatment responses in BMD as measured by DXA. Hence,
BTM are useful for clinical monitoring of treatment response and adherence from the
onset of treatment initiation.42 BTM have also shown usefulness in identifying patients
in accelerated bone turnover states and establishing a prognosis for fragility fracture.43
BTM levels can be affected by multiple contributors to pre-analytical variability.
Factors that can be adjusted and minimised, termed controllable factors, include
circadian rhythm variations, food intake, exercise level, alcohol intake, seasonal
variation, and medications such as oral glucocorticoids and aromatase inhibitors.
Factors contributing to pre-analytical variability that cannot be controlled, known as
uncontrollable factors, include age, degree of mobility/immobility, ethnicity, presence
of fracture, and menopausal state.44,45
Osteoporotic patients presenting with severely elevated initial BTM values (>3 SDs
above the mean) are atypical and should prompt a workup for other causes such as,46,47
a recent fracture, hyperparathyroidism, Paget disease, chronic kidney disease and
cancer. [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
Although all BTM can shift in response to osteoporotic disease processes, the IOF and
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) have recommended48 using
serum P1NP and CTX-1 as bone formation and resorption markers, respectively, for
fracture risk prediction and monitoring osteoporosis treatment (see Section 3.6).
[Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
3.6 Monitoring therapy
Recommendation
• All patients commenced on active anti-osteoporosis therapy
should be assessed for response to treatment
Grade D ☑
All patients initiated with active anti-osteoporosis therapy should be reviewed within
three months to review tolerability. To assess response to treatment, patients should
be reviewed at least annually.
Monitoring should encompass assessment for fracture, BMD and BTM (see Table 3-5).

• Clinically evaluate for back pain, recent falls and loss of
height
• Vertebral or skeletal radiographs – these radiographs
are indicated if there is clinical suspicion of fracture
(e.g. back pain, recent falls or loss of height)13,17
• A vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) done during
BMD measurement to look for asymptomatic vertebral
fractures can be used as well
Monitoring BMD
[Grade D, Level 4 ☑]
• Intervals between BMD testing should be determined
according to patient’s clinical status, typically 1 year
after initiation of therapy or change in therapy, and
longer intervals once therapeutic effect is established19
• In conditions associated with rapid bone loss such as
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, more frequent
BMD monitoring is appropriate19
• Consider that there has been an adequate response to
treatment if, there is a 1-2% increase in BMD/year for
up to 3-5 years or a stable BMD13,21
• A continued loss of BMD of >5% in at least 2 serial
BMD measurements at the lumbar spine or >4% at the
proximal femur49 would suggest treatment failure
• Monitoring for treatment response using QUS and
peripheral DXA is not recommended19
• The role of TBS in monitoring the effect of antiresorptive therapy is unclear whilst there is a potential
role for it in monitoring anabolic therapy19
Monitoring BTM
[Grade C, Level 2+]
• Significant reductions in BTM are seen with antiresorptive therapy and associated with fracture
reduction13,21,50
• Decreases in BTM on anti-resorptive therapy of less
than the least significant change (or reference change
value [RCV]) is considered “failure of therapy”51,52
• Significant increases in BTM indicate good response to
anabolic therapy13,21
• A lack of decrease in BTM with bisphosphonates could
indicate a lack of compliance or inadequate drug
absorption (i.e. taken with calcium/food)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
CTX is commonly recommended for monitoring adherence with bisphosphonates
and denosumab whilst P1NP has been recommended for monitoring treatment with
anabolic agents in clinical practice (see Table 3-6 and refer to Section 3.5.4).

Guide for timing of BTM tests [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
• Baseline measurement
• One repeat measurement of the same marker 3-6 months after treatment initiation54
• Yearly after that if non-compliance, issues with drug absorption or treatment failure
is suspected44,48,54
• All measurements should be taken at the same time of the day to minimise the effect
of diurnal variation and other contributors to pre-analytical variability
Assessing for treatment compliance is crucial at all times throughout the course of
treatment. BTM can be used to assess adherence to oral bisphosphonates.
When there is evidence of a lack of response to treatment (e.g. falling BMD or failure
to achieve expected changes in BTM), check for compliance to medications and reexamine need to evaluate for secondary causes before determining treatment failure
or justifying a change in treatment (see Section 5.13).55 [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]

SECTION 4:
4.1 Nutrition
4.1.1 Calcium and vitamin D
Recommendation
• Adequate calcium and vitamin D is important for peak bone
mass attainment and osteoporosis prevention in adults and
postmenopausal women
Grade A
Meeting adequate calcium intake has the best evidence for peak bone mass attainment
in children and adolescents to prevent osteoporosis in later life.56 [Grade A, Level 1++]
Increasing calcium intake either by dietary sources or supplements has small nonprogressive effects on bone mineral density (BMD) in adults and postmenopausal
women. Calcium supplements increased BMD measurements by 0.7-1.8% in one year.57
[Grade A, Level 1++] However, calcium is considered a threshold nutrient which does
not confer additional benefits on BMD when recommended levels are obtained.
Adequate vitamin D intake may also be important for peak bone mass attainment in
children and adolescents.56 [Grade A, Level 1++]
The recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for calcium and vitamin D according to agegroups are shown in Table 4-1 (see Appendix 3 for examples of calcium content in
certain foods).

Vitamin D supplements are available as ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol
(vitamin D3). Vitamin D2 is derived from plant sources and vitamin D3 from animal
sources or exposure to sunlight.59 With daily dosing, vitamins D2 and D3 appear to be
equally potent60 [Level 1+] but with intermittent (weekly or monthly) dosing, vitamin
D3 appears to be approximately 3-times more potent than vitamin D2.61 [Level 1++]
Blood levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] provide the best index of vitamin D
stores. It has been suggested that levels of >20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) is the minimum level
for skeletal health.62 However, the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF)63 and
Endocrine Society64 recommend 25(OH)D levels of >30 ng/ml (>75 nmol/l) for optimal
bone and musculoskeletal health. [Level 4, Grade D]
We suggest that all adults who are vitamin D deficient be treated with 50,000 IU of
vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once a week for eight weeks or its equivalent of 6000 IU of
vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily to achieve a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/ml,64
followed by maintenance therapy of 800–1000 IU/day. [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
4.1.2 Body weight
Although low body mass index (BMI) is a recognised risk factor for fragility fractures,65
recent evidence has challenged the concept that being overweight or obese might
lower fracture risk.66
SECTION 4: PREVENTION OF OSTEOPOROSIS AND FALLS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
4.1.3 Caffeine intake
Caffeine increases faecal and urinary calcium excretion and may induce a negative
calcium balance if dietary calcium intake is insufficient.67 High caffeine intake (>330 mg
caffeine/day) has been associated with increased risk of fragility fracture.68,69 However,
the effect of caffeine appears to be mitigated by increasing calcium intake (40 mg
calcium for every 177.5 ml cup of coffee).70 Patients that regularly consume caffeinated
drinks should be advised to increase their calcium intake accordingly.
4.1.4 Smoking
Smoking increases osteoporotic fracture risk. Current smokers have the highest risk
(Relative Risk [RR]=1.25; 95% CI 1.15,1.36), followed by ex-smokers (RR=1.19; 95% CI
1.12,1.27) when compared to those who have never smoked.71 [Grade B, Level 2++]
4.1.5 Alcohol intake
Excessive alcohol intake (>2 units daily) should be avoided as it has been associated
with increased rates of any fracture and osteoporotic fracture in both men and
women.72 [Grade C, Level 2+]
4.2 Exercise
Recommendations
• Regular physical activity, in particular weight-bearing exercise is
encouraged in all age groups to maximise peak bone mass, decrease
age-related bone loss, maintain muscle strength and balance
• Exercise and physical therapy are recommended to prevent falls and
injuries from falls
Grade C
Grade A
4.2.1 Exercise for the prevention of osteoporosis
Regular exercise, in particular weight-bearing exercise (e.g. brisk walking and line
dancing) is encouraged in all age groups in order to maximise peak bone mass, decrease
age-related bone loss, maintain muscle strength and balance.73-75 [Grade D, Level 4] It
is important that an individual’s health status should be taken into consideration when
recommending an exercise programme.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
4.2.2 Exercise for falls prevention
(See also Section 4.3)
Studies have shown the benefits of exercise in the prevention of falls which were
significant even in the very old (≥80 years).76 A systematic review that included 116
studies involving 25,160 participants found that exercise reduces the rate of falls by
23% (pooled rate ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.71,0.83) compared to controls.77 Multiple exercise
component interventions (i.e. combining ≥2 categories of exercise) have shown to
reduce rate of falls beyond 12 months,77,78 effectively prevented falls and reduced fallrelated injuries.76,79,80
Sufficient intensity and duration of exercise are required for it to be effective.81
Interventions with a total weekly dose of >3 hours77,82 that included balance,
functional and resistance exercises were particularly effective in reducing the rate of
falls82,83 while programmes primarily involving resistance training, dance, or walking
remain uncertain.77
However, there is no difference in the effectiveness of exercise on the rate of falls
whether the intervention was delivered in a group setting or to an individual alone.83
Exercise has also been shown to reduce the likelihood of sustaining a fracture by 2646%.80,83,84 These studies included either elements of resistance or strength training,
gait and balance exercise, and weight-bearing component. Additionally, there is also
uncertainty if certain individual groups would derive more benefit from exercise than
others.
Current evidence is unable to make recommendation of one form of exercise over
another to reduce the risk of falls and fractures. However, the evidence does support
exercise to be an essential part of an individual’s management to reduce their risk of
falls and falls-related fractures.

4.3.1 Evaluation of falls
A multifactorial falls risk assessment should be performed for all older adults85,86 with
history of falls, who sought fall-related medical attention in the last 12 months or with
abnormalities of gait or balance.
Areas of focus during evaluation of falls should comprise of the following parameters
(see Appendix 4 for more details):
• A detailed and focused history of fall incidents. In the event of a history of
unexplained falls, further assessment will be required
• Review of medications especially those that could increase falls risk
• Assessment or identification of any acute or chronic medical illness
• Assessment and identification of any visual or hearing impairment and its impact on
daily living
• Assessment of the person’s ability to ambulate, perform activities of daily living, use
of assistive devices and support structures
• Examination of gait and balance, the neurological and cardiovascular system
4.3.2 Interventions for falls prevention
Identification of risk factors through a comprehensive multifactorial falls risk
assessment would usually identify a number of contributing factors which would

poor adherence to intervention plans such as difficulties attending appointments to exercise programmes,
lack of interest in mitigating home hazards, and refusal for medication modification.
SECTION 4: PREVENTION OF OSTEOPOROSIS AND FALLS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
Recommendations
• Hip protectors used in care home residents can reduce the risk of
hip fractures
• Hip protectors can be considered for non-care home residents
provided they have the appropriate supervisions and the right
level of training in its use
Grade B
Grade D ☑
4.4 Hip protectors
Over 90% of hip fractures result from a fall.100 Hip protectors reduce, absorb and/or
shunt the impact on the hip during a fall to prevent a fracture occurring. They range
from a hard shell (hard protectors) to a dense foam padding (soft protectors) which are
worn in an undergarment to cover the trochanteric area of the hip. No one type of hip
protector has been shown to be superior.
Hip protectors may reduce the risk of hip fractures among older people living in care
homes.101,102 However, its effectiveness involving community dwelling older people
were less certain.102 With appropriate supervision and the right level of training, it may
still be an option for those residing in non-care home setting.
Any effectiveness from this intervention is dependent on the older person wearing
the hip protector and adhering to it. Though acceptance with hip protectors has been
shown to range from 37-72%, and adherence from 20-92%,103 compliance decreased
the longer it was worn.100
Barriers to its use include dislike of its appearance, urinary incontinence, unwanted
side effects (e.g. skin irritation, abrasion, swelling, abdominal bloating, too hot and
discomfort/pain), loss of independence with toileting, cognitive impairment and
the effort required to wear it.100,104 Hence, prescribing hip protectors needs to be
accompanied by strategies to aid compliance.

POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
SECTION 5:
5.1 Treatment initiation
In Malaysia, postmenopausal women should be considered for treatment based on
the National Osteoporosis Foundation’s (NOF) recommendation105 if they fulfil any of
following, after exclusion of secondary causes of osteoporosis: [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
• Identification of low trauma hip, vertebral, wrist or any other major fragility fracture
(clinical or asymptomatic)
• T-score ≤-2.5 at the femoral neck, total hip or lumbar spine on dual energy x ray
absorptiometry (DXA)
• In patients with osteopenia (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) with Fracture Risk
Assessment Tool (FRAX®) calculated 10-year fracture probability of >3% for hip and
>20% for major osteoporotic related fracture
5.2 Risk stratification
In recent years, guidelines have recommended the risk stratification of patients
with osteoporosis into low-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk for fractures.13,106 These
recommendations were made following clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of
anabolic therapies in reducing the fracture risks in very high-risk individuals.107-110
Various definitions have been proposed to stratify fracture risks for people with
osteoporosis.13,106 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)
proposed the following features to identify people with very high risk of fracture:13
• Recent fracture (within the past 12 months)
• Fractures while on approved osteoporosis therapy
• Multiple fractures
• Fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (e.g. glucocorticoids)
• Previous history of injurious falls or high risk of falls
• Advanced age
• Frailty
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
• Very low BMD measurement (T-score <-3.0)
• Very high FRAX® risk (>30% for major osteoporotic fracture and >4.5% for hip
fracture), or other validated fracture risk algorithms
The committee decided to adopt the AACE recommendations until further evidence,
especially with regards to risk stratification in our local population, is available.
5.2.1 Management based on risk stratification
Recommendations
• All individuals with osteoporosis should have optimisation of their
calcium and vitamin D intake and life-style intervention together
with pharmacological therapy
• Very high-risk individuals should be considered for treatment
with an anabolic agent if available. Other alternatives (in order of
preference) include denosumab or parenteral bisphosphonates
• High-risk individuals should be treated with anti-resorptives (e.g.
bisphosphonates or denosumab)
• Low-risk individuals should be considered for menopausal
hormone replacement or selective estrogen receptor modulators,
if clinically indicated
Grade A
Grade B
Grade A
Grade B
• Very high-risk individuals require calcium and vitamin D optimisation, lifestyle
intervention, as well as pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis. Treatment
with sequential therapy with an anabolic agent followed by anti-resorptive, or
intravenous bisphosphonates or denosumab are recommended for these patients
[Grade B, Level 1++]
• High-risk individuals require calcium and vitamin D optimisation, lifestyle
intervention, and pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis. Oral bisphosphonates
or other anti-resorptive are recommended as the first line of treatment for high-risk
patients [Grade A, Level 1++]
• Low-risk individuals can be managed with calcium and vitamin D optimisation, and
lifestyle intervention. [Grade B, Level 2++] Menopausal hormone replacement
(MHT) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) may be used when indicated
[Grade B, Level 1++]
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
5.3 Treatment sequence
Treatment sequence will depend primarily on (see Algorithm A):
• Risk stratification
• Age
• Site of prior fragility fracture
• Patient preference, adherence and tolerability
In patients with very high risk of fractures, anabolic agents (teriparatide and
romosuzomab) are most appropriate to promptly reduce fracture risk.106,110-114 [Grade
B, Level 1+] Anabolic agents should be followed by an anti-resorptive agent to maintain
anti-fracture efficacy106,112,113 as their treatment is limited to 12-24 months and the
efficacy wanes once treatment is discontinued.
A recent fracture (within the past two years) is a stronger predictor of fracture in the
following two years (imminent fracture risk) than is an older fracture (>5 years) history.
In these patients, active osteoporosis therapies should be initiated without delay,
lifestyle changes implemented and calcium and vitamin D intake optimised. [Grade
B, Level 1+]
In patients with hip and non-vertebral fractures, bisphosphonates, denosumab and
anabolic agents can be used while SERM are not recommended. [Grade A, Level 1++]
Patient preference, affordability, degree of adherence and tolerance to the side effect
profile of the treatment are also important in dictating sequence of treatment used.
5.4 Menopausal hormone therapy
Recommendation
• Menopausal hormone therapy offered to symptomatic women
<60-years-old and within 10 years of menopause helps prevent and
treat postmenopausal osteoporosis
Grade A
Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is now called Menopausal
Hormone Therapy (MHT). MHT is available as estrogen therapy (ET) for women
without a uterus and combined estrogen progestogen therapy (EPT) for women with
an intact uterus.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
ET prevents and treats postmenopausal osteoporosis. ET or EPT should be initiated
around the time of menopause to achieve maximum bone protection. In the absence of
contraindications, MHT (ET/EPT) initiated within 10 years of the last menstrual period
or in women <60 years old is an effective treatment for moderate-to-severe vasomotor
symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of the menopause (GSM).
Both ET and EPT have been shown to:
• Increase BMD at all skeletal sites in early and late postmenopause115 [Grade A, Level
1++]
• Reduce fragility fracture risks (spine, hip and non-vertebral sites) by 20-35%116,117
[Grade A, Level 1+]
• Statistically reduce hip fracture incidence by 33%, in the Women’s Health Initiative
study, with six fewer fractures per 10,000 person-years overall116,118 [Grade A, Level 1+]
The effect of estrogen on bone is dose-related117,118 [Grade A, Level1+]
• Standard-dose ET and EPT reduces postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures (spine,
hip, and non-vertebral sites) even in women without osteoporosis117,118 [Grade A,
Level1+]
• Low dose MHT has been shown to protect bone by decreasing bone turnover markers
(BTM) and preventing bone loss. However, data on the efficacy of low dose MHT on
fracture efficacy is not robust119,120 [Grade B, Level 2++]
• Discontinuation of MHT results in accelerated bone turnover, decrease in BMD and
loss of anti-fracture efficacy121 [Grade D, Level 3]122 [Grade B, Level 2++]
The risks of MHT vary with dose, duration, route of administration, timing of initiation
and the type of estrogen or progestogen used. Oral estradiol has a lower risk for venous
thromboembolism (VTE) than conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) (Relative Risk [RR]
0.85, CI, 0.76 – 0.95).123 [Grade C, Level 2+]
Transdermal estrogen (either as a gel, patch, or spray) compared to oral estrogen, has
been found to be as effective in preserving bone density, and is more favourable to
the cardiovascular (CV) system, less thrombogenic and associated with a lower risk of
thromboembolism.123 [Grade C, Level 2+]124,125 [Grade B, Level 2++]
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
The addition of micronised progesterone or dydrogesterone in combined EPT
preparations compared to other progestogens has been found to be associated with
lower risk for CV, thromboembolic and breast cancer events.126,127 [Grade A, Level 1++]
MHT utilisation in women <60 years old or within 10 years of menopause has not been
shown to increase the risk of CV events, stroke, VTE and haemorrhagic stroke.128 [Grade
A, Level 1++]
However, initiation of MHT in women >60 years old or after 10 years of menopause for
the prevention of osteoporosis fractures is not recommended.128 [Grade A, Level 1++]
A full gynaecological assessment is mandatory prior to starting MHT with the dose and
type of MHT tailor-made for that individual.129 [Grade A, Level 1++]
• There is presently no definite duration for MHT use
• An annual medical review is advised with a risk- benefit evaluation leading to a
shared decision to either continue, taper, or stop MHT
Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) occurs when the ovaries stop functioning before
the age of 40 years. Women with POI require hormones in view of the increased risk of
osteoporosis, CV disease, and urogenital symptoms. Unless contraindicated, MHT or
oral contraceptives (which are less effective than MHT for bone health) is advised until
the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed.128 [Grade A, Level
1++]
5.5 Tibolone
Recommendation
• Women who are one year past their last period may be offered
Tibolone for the relief of menopausal symptoms and prevention
of osteoporosis
Grade A
Tibolone is a synthetic hormone with estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic
properties and is indicated for the relief of menopausal symptoms and the prevention of
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.130 [Grade A, Level 1++]131 [Grade A, Level 1+]

Efficacy of tibolone
The Long-term Intervention on Fractures with Tibolone (LIFT) study,132 [Grade A, Level
1++]133 [Grade A, Level 1+] involved postmenopausal osteoporotic women between
60-85 years old and non-osteoporotic women and compared 1.25 mg and 2.5 mg
tibolone with placebo. 1.25 mg tibolone significantly increased lumbar and hip BMD,
and greater absolute reduction among women with prior vertebral fracture (20.8 per
1000 person-years) than with no prior vertebral fracture (8.6 per 1000 person-years).132
[Grade A, Level 1+]
Safety of tibolone
Tibolone is not advised in older postmenopausal women due to increased risk of stroke
and in women who have strong risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, smoking,
diabetes, and atrial fibrillation.132 [Grade A, Level 1+]
Tibolone is not associated with increased risk of coronary events or VTE,123 [Grade B,
Level 2+]134 [Grade A, Level1++] or increased mammographic breast density.135 [Grade
A, Level1++]136 [Grade B, Level 2+]133 [Grade A, Level 1+] Although tibolone is not
associated with an increased risk of breast cancer,135 [Grade A, Level1+]136 [Grade B,
Level 2+]133 [Grade A, Level 1+] it is not recommended in breast cancer survivors due
to an increased risk of recurrence.
Monitoring
Women on tibolone should be monitored annually similar to women on MHT.129,137
[Grade A, Level 1+]
5.6 Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators
Recommendation
• Raloxifene may be recommended for postmenopausal osteoporosis
as it reduces new vertebral fractures in women with or without prior
fractures
Grade A
SERM are synthetic non-steroidal molecules that bind to estrogen receptors throughout
the body. They act as an estrogen agonist or antagonist depending on the target organ.
Raloxifene (RLX) is a second-generation SERM.

Efficacy of raloxifene
Outcomes from the multicentre randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind Multiple
Outcomes of Raloxifen Evaluation (MORE) study,138,139 [Grade A, Level 1+] demonstrated
that RLX increased BMD by 2-3% at the lumbar spine and femoral neck and reduced
incidence of vertebral fracture by 40-50% after three years.
There was also a 22% decreased incidence of major osteoporotic fractures in women
with prevalent vertebral fractures140 [Grade A, Level1+] but no effect was seen on the
risk of non-vertebral fractures. A 66% reduction in the incidence of invasive breast
cancer and 76% reduction in the incidence of estrogen receptor (ER) positive invasive
breast cancer was also seen.

5.7 Bisphosphonates
Recommendations
• Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for osteoporosis. The
overall risk-benefit ratio of treatment with bisphosphonates for
osteoporosis is positive
• Oral bisphosphonates are not recommended for patients with an
eGFR <30 ml/min (chronic kidney disease stage 4-5)
• Zoledronic acid is contraindicated in patients with eGFR <35 ml/min
• It is recommended to review the efficacy of bisphosphonate
treatment after 3-5 years. Continuation of treatment would depend
on the treatment response, occurrence of side effects, and future
fracture risk

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
5.7.1 Alendronate
[Grade A, Level 1++]
Alendronate at 10 mg daily for three years increases lumbar spine BMD by up to 8.8%
and femoral neck BMD by 5.9% compared to placebo.143 Vertebral and hip fractures are
reduced by 50% in women with143 or without144 prior fracture. Wrist fracture is reduced
by 50% in patients with prior vertebral fracture.145 Fracture reduction is seen after one
year of treatment.146 Pooled analysis found an overall reduction in risk of hip fracture
of 45% to 55% in patients receiving alendronate therapy.147 Alendronate 70 mg weekly
has similar efficacy to alendronate 10 mg daily in the treatment of postmenopausal
osteoporosis.146 Continuous use of alendronate, for up to 10 years, if clinically
indicated,148,149 produces a sustained increase in BMD and a 55% significant reduction
in spine fracture with a good safety profile.
5.7.2 Risedronate
[Grade A, Level 1++]
Treatment with risedronate 5 mg daily for three years increases lumbar spine BMD
by 6.4%150 and femoral neck BMD by 3.4%151 compared to placebo, and is associated
with up to 49% reduction in new vertebral fracture in women with prior vertebral
fractures,152 and 39% reduction in non-vertebral fractures.153 Vertebral fracture risk
reduction is seen after six months of therapy.154 Reduction of hip fracture risk after
three years was 40% in women with confirmed osteoporosis and 60% in women with
at least one co-existing vertebral fracture.151
Treatment with risedronate in the 4th and 5th year significantly reduced risk of new
vertebral fractures by 59% compared to 49% in the first three years.155 The mean
increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD over five years was 9.3%.155 Currently, the
use of risedronate for up to seven years, is safe and efficacious.156 Risedronate 35 mg
once weekly has similar efficacy to the 5 mg daily dosing.154
5.7.3 Ibandronate
[Grade A, Level 1+]
Treatment with oral ibandronate 150 mg/month increases the lumbar spine BMD by
6.6% over two years in postmenopausal osteoporotic women without prior fracture
compared to placebo.157 Oral ibandronate 2.5 mg daily for three years reduces vertebral
fracture by 62% in postmenopausal women with prevalent vertebral fracture.158
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
Ibandronate 150 mg/month has been shown to be non-inferior to the 2.5 mg daily dose
in terms of BMD gain and incidence of vertebral fracture.159 Ibandronate 150 mg/month
significantly reduced non-vertebral fracture by 38-43% over two years – based on pooled
analysis of individual patient data.160
5.7.4 Zoledronic acid
[Grade A, Level 1++]
Treatment with zoledronic acid (ZA) (5 mg intravenous [IV] infusion over at least 15
minutes once yearly) in osteoporotic postmenopausal women over three years161
reduces incidence of vertebral fractures by 70% with significant reduction seen by oneyear, hip fracture by 41%, and non-vertebral fracture by 25%. ZA yearly infusion also162
reduced the risk of new clinical fractures by 35% in patients who recently (within 90
days) had a low trauma hip fracture and was associated with reduction in mortality of
up to 28% in the same trial. At three years, patients on ZA will require re-evaluation163-165
as continuing therapy with ZA beyond three years only provided marginal benefit, as
shown in the Phase III trial extended up to six years and nine years.163,164
Treatment with IV ZA provides an alternative osteoporosis treatment to patients who
cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates including those who cannot swallow or sit up
straight, and who have had bariatric procedures.
ZA may cause flu like symptoms (e.g. pyrexia and myalgia) that may last 1-7 days,
particularly after the first dose.51 This can be minimised by pre-treatment with
paracetamol or ibuprofen, and administering ZA over 30 minutes or longer. Baseline
measurements taken before ZA infusions should include renal function, serum calcium
and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. ZA is not recommended in patients with an
eGFR below 35ml/min/m3.51,166 Hypocalcaemia may occur after ZA particularly in those
with vitamin D deficiency.167 It is recommended that in the ideal setting, serum 25(OH)
D levels should be evaluated and corrected to at least ≥ 50nmol/L prior to ZA infusion
to prevent hypocalcaemia.168
5.7.5 Complications of bisphosphonate therapy
Atypical femoral fractures (AFFs)
AFFs have been increasingly recognised as potential complications of bisphosphonate
therapy.169 The risk of AFFs increases with duration of bisphosphonate use.170 The
age-adjusted incidence rate of AFFs has been estimated to be 1.78 per 100,000 personyears in patients on bisphosphonate use <2 years and the incident rate increases to
113.1 per 100,000 person-years with >8 years’ duration.171
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
Though it has been shown that Asians on bisphosphonate therapy may have an
increased risk of AFFs compared to Caucasians,172,173 AFFs have also been found to
occur in patients without a history of bisphosphonate therapy.174 Patients on antiresorptive therapy who develop thigh pain should have imaging performed to look
for evidence of stress changes in the femur within the AFF spectrum.170 Overall, the
benefit of reducing further osteoporotic fractures with bisphosphonate treatment is
much greater than the small absolute risk of AFFs.169,172,175
Management of AFFs169
• Discontinue anti-resorptives
• Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, with supplementation, as required
• Trial of conservative management in those with incomplete AFFs without pain
- If there are no symptomatic and radiographic improvement after 2-3 months,
prophylactic nail fixation should be strongly considered, because these patients
may progress to a complete fracture
• Surgical management with intramedullary nail fixation is recommended for
incomplete AFFs with pain, and complete AFFs
- After surgical treatment of AFFs, further medical treatment has to balance the risk
of causing new atypical fractures against the risk of fragility fractures when not
treating osteoporosis
- Even though observational data suggest that teriparatide (recombinant human
parathyroid hormone 1-34 [r-PTH]) might result in faster healing of surgically
treated AFFs, the European Calcified Tissue Society guidelines do not recommend
r-PTH for AFF healing apart from reducing the risk of typical fragility fractures.176
However, in patients at high risk of further osteoporotic fractures, a course of
r-PTH for two years is recommended. Following the 2-year course of r-PTH, further
treatment needs to be given to maintain the r-PTH BMD gain
• Other treatment options would depend on the risk level of further fragility fractures
(high/low) and/or whether the AFFs have been treated non-operatively or surgically
managed176
• Assess the contralateral hip for possible asymptomatic AFF
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)
ONJ is defined as “exposed”, non-vital bone involving maxillofacial structures with
delayed healing despite >8 weeks of appropriate medical care.177 ONJ is usually
associated with invasive dental procedures thought to be caused by trauma to
dentoalveolar structures with limited capacity for bone healing but, can also occur
de novo.178
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
The absolute risk of ONJ is very low ranging from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000.179
However, the risk of ONJ reaches 21 in 10000 (0.21%) in patients on >4 years of oral
bisphosphonates.173 ONJ is likely to occur earlier in those treated with IV versus oral
forms of bisphosphonates180 and those on longer duration of therapy.181 It is more
commonly seen (incidence rates from 4-13%) in patients on oncological doses (high
dose and more frequent IV) of bisphosphonates and denosumab including those182
on cancer treatment, with bone metastasis, who are immune suppressed, have had
radiation, on anti-angiogenic therapies, with infection, poor oral hygiene and, have had
invasive dental procedures.
ONJ may be managed conservatively at stage 0-2, but surgical debridement and
resection is recommended for stage 3 ONJ (see Appendix 5 for detailed description
and treatment of ONJ stages).183 There are no recommendations to stopping
bisphosphonates for dental procedures but initiation should be deferred until the area
is healed.184
Other side effects of bisphosphonates
Other common side effects of oral bisphosphonates are gastrointestinal,
commonly nausea, although actual incidence is low.185,186 Proper administration of
bisphosphonates by taking it in the morning on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before
food with a glass of water, in an upright position, will improve the systemic absorption
of the drug and reduce the small risk of oesophagitis and oesophageal ulceration. The
evidence to date on the association of oral bisphosphonates and oesophageal cancer
from the United Kingdom General Practice Database remains inconclusive. For patients
with upper gastrointestinal disease, IV ZA or denosumab are alternatives. Some generic
forms of alendronate are more poorly tolerated in terms of gastrointestinal side effects,
leading to poor adherence.187
There has been some concern over the association of bisphosphonates to atrial
fibrillation, but results have been conflicting.188 There is a reported increased risk of
cardiac arrhythmias in patients who continued ZA for nine years versus those who
discontinued at six years.164 A meta-analysis from randomised controlled trials and
observational studies suggested a significantly increased risk of atrial fibrillation
requiring hospitalisation, but no increase in the risk of CV mortality, with the use of
bisphosphonate.189 To date, there has not been an association between bisphosphonate
with strokes.189

SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
5.7.6 Use of bisphosphonates in renal impairment and chronic kidney
disease
In patients with chronic kidney disease without evidence of CKD-MBD (chronic kidney
disease-mineral bone disease), the use of bisphosphonates for fracture risk reduction
should not differ from general population guidelines.190 [Grade A, Level 1+]
Post hoc analyses of pivotal clinical trials evaluating bisphosphonates found that
they had similar efficacy, improved BMD and reduced fractures, in subjects with mild
or moderately reduced eGFR (up to CKD stage 4 [see Appendix 6 for CKD stages])
compared to those with normal eGFR.191 [Level 1+]
In those at CKD stage 3b-4, bisphosphonate users had a 14% higher risk of CKD stage
progression than non-users.192 [Level 2+]
Oral bisphosphonates are not recommended for patients with an estimated GFR
<30 ml/min (stage 4-5). [Grade D, Level 4] The IV bisphosphonate, ZA, is contraindicated
in patients with an eGFR <35mL/min.193 [Grade A, Level 1+]
5.7.7 Long-term use of bisphosphonates
It is recommended that after five years of oral bisphosphonates or three years of IV
bisphosphonates, there should be a reassessment of the patient’s fracture risk.
Table 5-1. Recommended duration of bisphosphonate therapy for women
Risk stratification
Recommended duration of treatment
Women at high-risk, e.g.
• Fracture during treatment
• Low hip T-score ≤2.5
• High fracture risk score with FRAX®
• Previous major osteoporotic fracture
• Older women >70-years-old with any
of the above risk factors
• Continue for up to 10 years (oral) or 6
years (IV) with periodic evaluation194
[Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
Women not at high-risk
• After 3-5 years of bisphosphonates
therapy, a drug holiday of 2 years can
be considered194 [Grade D, Level 4,

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
However, it has been shown that there is an increased risk of hip and vertebral fractures
after a 2-year drug holiday for those on the oral bisphosphonates, alendronate and
risedronate,195 [Level 2+] which would suggest that patients should be reviewed no
longer than two years after starting a drug holiday.
5.8 Recombinant human PTH 1-34
Recommendations
• r-PTH/teriparatide is indicated for individuals with very high risk for
fractures or osteoporosis not responding to treatment
• r-PTH therapy is recommended for up to 24 months
Grade A
Grade B
Recombinant human PTH 1-34 (r-PTH/teriparatide), is a potent anabolic agent. r-PTH
is indicated for individuals at very high risk for fractures (e.g. those with multiple
vertebral fractures) or osteoporosis not responsive to other anti-osteoporosis therapy
(see also Section 5.13 Treatment failure).111,196 [Grade A, Level 1++]
Subcutaneously administered r-PTH at 20 µg daily for 21 months increases lumbar
spine BMD by up to 8.6% and femoral neck BMD by 3.5% compared to placebo in
postmenopausal women with vertebral fractures.109
A meta-analysis comparing r-PTH with placebo showed a 74% reduction in risk of
vertebral fractures (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.39) and a 39% reduction in the risk
of non-vertebral fractures (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.85).111 [Grade A, Level 1++] A
head-to-head comparison114 [Level 1++] between r-PTH (anabolic) and risedronate
(anti-resorptive) [VERO Trial] in postmenopausal women at very high risk of fracture,
showed superiority of r-PTH in vertebral and clinical (non-vertebral plus clinical
vertebral) fractures.
Current recommendation for the treatment duration of r-PTH is up to 24 months.
[Grade B, Level 1+] The benefits of anabolic therapy wear off within one year of
discontinuation,197 [Grade B, Level 1+] hence, the recommendation is to initiate
anti-resorptive therapies, when stopping anabolic therapy, to maintain bone density
gains.198,199 [Grade A, Level 1++]200 [Grade B, Level 1+]
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
Side effects include dizziness, leg cramps and hypercalcaemia. Serum calcium should
be checked prior to starting r-PTH. The drug is contraindicated in patients with open
epiphyses (children and adolescents), Paget’s disease of the bone, prior radiation
therapy involving the skeleton, bone malignancies, metabolic bone diseases other
than osteoporosis or pre-existing hypercalcaemia. [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
5.9 Denosumab
Recommendations
• Denosumab is an effective anti-resorptive treatment for
osteoporosis especially for those at high risk of osteoporotic
fractures
• A denosumab ‘drug holiday’ is not recommended due to an
associated rebound increase in bone turnover and increased risk
of multiple vertebral fractures (especially in those at high risk of
osteoporotic fractures) when the drug is discontinued
• Treatment reassessment may be done after 5-10 years and those
who remain at high fracture risk should either continue denosumab
or be switched to other osteoporosis therapies
• If denosumab is stopped, subsequent treatment with another
treatment option should be initiated to prevent the rebound
increase in bone turnover seen with denosumab withdrawal
Grade A
Grade B
Grade D ☑
Grade D ☑
Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG) that inhibits the formation,
function, and survival of osteoclasts by inhibiting RANK (receptor activator of nuclear
factor kappa-B) ligand, thus reducing bone resorption.201
Efficacy of denosumab
The FREEDOM trial (Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis
Every 6 Months) – 6-monthly subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg over three years vs
placebo202 [Level 1++] demonstrated significant increase in BMD (9.2% for lumbar
spine, 60% for total hip, 4.8% in femoral neck and 3.5% in distal 1/3rd radius) and
significantly reduced the relative risk of new fractures by 68% (vertebral), 40% (hip)
and 20% (non-vertebral). In the open-label extension trial (denosumab for up to 10
years),203 [Level 1++] there was continued improvements in BMD with increases from
baseline after three years. The yearly incidences of new vertebral and non-vertebral
fractures were similar to that observed at three years.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
Denosumab has also demonstrated greater BMD gains after 12 months of treatment
with denosumab vs ZA at all skeletal sites in postmenopausal women switched from
oral bisphosphonates to injectables.204 [Level 1+]
Discontinuation of denosumab
Although a potent anti-resorptive, discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a
rebound increased in bone turnover, loss of BMD and possible increased risk of multiple
vertebral fractures especially in the high-risk group.205 [Level 2+]
A placebo controlled randomised controlled trial showed that four doses of denosumab
given 6-monthly significantly increased BMD and reduced bone turnover, however, on
stopping denosumab, the BTM serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) and
procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) increased to above baseline levels
as early as 3-6 months and returned to baseline by 24 months.206 [Level 1+] BMD at all
sites decreased within 12-24 months, and spine and total hip BMD reached baseline at
12 months. Significant BMD loss occurred despite longer treatment duration.207 [Level
4]208 [Level 2+]
Participants who discontinued denosumab during the FREEDOM trial and its
extension,209 [Level 2++] had increased rates of new vertebral fractures similar to
those on placebo. Of those who experienced at least one vertebral fracture, 60.7%
had multiple fractures. The risk of developing vertebral fractures post-denosumab
cessation were individuals with history of vertebral fractures.
Missing or delaying denosumab doses by a few months may result in an elevated risk
of vertebral fractures and should be avoided.209 [Level 2++] Hence the concept of drug
holiday is not applicable to denosumab.
Those who have stopped denosumab should be transitioned to other treatments
for osteoporosis to reduce the rebound increase in bone turnover and fracture risk
associated with denosumab withdrawal.208 [Level 2+]205 [Level 4]
Adverse events
Over 10 years of treatment showed a consistent safety profile with low incidence of
adverse events such as serious infections, cellulitis, hypocalcaemia, eczema and
malignancy.203 [Level 1++] There was also low cumulative exposure-adjusted incidence
of AFFs (0.8 per 10000 participants-years) and ONJ (5.2 per 10000 participant-years).203

SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
Denosumab and renal impairment
Treatment with denosumab resulted in significant BMD increases at all sites in CKD
stages 1-3 (eGFR >30ml/min) and the hip in CKD stage 4 (eGFR 15-29ml/min). It also
reduced vertebral and non-vertebral fracture rates in CKD stages 1-3.210 [Level
2++] There is a greater risk of hypocalcaemia in patients with CKD especially those
with eGFR<30ml/min or on dialysis.211 [Level 2+] It is important to ensure adequate
calcium and vitamin D intake before commencing denosumab in those at risk of
hypocalcaemia.211 [Level 2+]
5.10 Romosozumab
Recommendations
• Romosozumab is an anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis
especially in patients with a very high fracture risk; preferably in
those with low CV risk
• Treatment with romosozumab is for 12 months, followed by antiresorptive therapy, e.g. denosumab or bisphosphonate
• Romosozumab is currently not recommended in patients with a
history of a CV event within the past one-year, and should be used
cautiously in patients with high CV risk and only when benefits
outweigh risks
Grade A
Grade A
Grade B
Romosozumab (RMZ) is an anabolic agent. It is a humanised monoclonal antibody that
binds to sclerostin. Changes in BTM point to a dual effect on bone remodelling, with
a transient increase in formation markers and reduction in resorption, resulting in an
increase in bone formation and BMD.
RMZ has been shown to exhibit a dose-dependent increase in BMD at the spine and hip
in all the Phase III trials.110,212-214 [Level 1++] The increase is seen as early as six months
after RMZ initiation and has demonstrated similar outcomes in both men214 [Level 1++]
and women.110,212,213 [Level 1++]
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
In the placebo-controlled FRAME trial involving women with postmenopausal
osteoporosis,212 [Level 1++] RMZ significantly increased BMD in 12 months and
reduced new vertebral fractures and clinical fractures by 73% and 36%, respectively.
In the second year,212 [Level 1++] the cumulative 24-month incidence of new vertebral
fractures was significantly reduced in the RMZ/denosumab than in the placebo/
denosumab group by 75% and 33%, respectively.
The ARCH trial,110 [Level 1++] a randomised controlled study with an active
bisphosphonate comparator group demonstrated superiority of RMZ over alendronate
at both 12 (double-blind) and 24 months (both groups on open-label alendronate).
Over 24 months there were significant reductions in vertebral fractures (48%), clinical
fractures (27%) and hip fractures (38%) in the RMZ/alendronate group compared to the
alendronate/alendronate group.
Compared to r-PTH, RMZ led to a larger anabolic window and showed greater gains in
BMD and bone strength when assessed by finite element analysis.213 [Level 1++]
Adverse events
The ARCH trial found a numerical imbalance in adjudicated major adverse cardiac
events (MACE) with more events (cardiac ischaemic events and cerebrovascular events)
occurring in subjects randomised to RMZ compared to alendronate. In total (of three
major randomised Phase III trials with RMZ),110,212,214 [Level 1++] 1.3% (n=77) in the RMZ
arms and 0.9% (n=53) in the control arms experienced a MACE (Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.40;
95% CI, 0.99 to 1.99).215 In Malaysia, RMZ is contraindicated in patients who have had a
myocardial infarction or stroke within the past one year.
5.11 Calcium and Vitamin D
Recommendation
• Vitamin D supplementation (at least 800 IU/day) in combination
with calcium (1200 mg/day elemental calcium) is recommended
for fracture and fall prevention in people above 50 years of age
who are at risk of fractures, particularly when initiating active
osteoporosis therapies
Grade A
Although population-level intervention has not been shown to be an effective public
health strategy,216 calcium and vitamin D supplementation may lead to a modest
reduction in fracture risk.56
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
The majority of medications for osteoporosis treatment are licensed in the context of
calcium and vitamin D repletion. The evidence supports that calcium combined with
a vitamin D supplement be prescribed in the treatment of osteoporosis in people of
≥50 years old.217 [Level 1-] Table 5-2 lists the percentage of calcium absorption from
different types of formulation and Table 5-3 describes the evidence for calcium, vitamin
D and their combination.
The evidence supports calcium combined with a vitamin D supplement, in the
treatment of osteoporosis in people ≥50 years old at doses of 1200 mg/day of calcium
and 800 IU/day of vitamin D to achieve maximum therapeutic effect 218-221 [Level 1++]

hip fractures223,224 [Level 1++]
• A 2015 meta-analysis reported that in 26 randomised
controlled trials, calcium supplements reduced the risk of
total fracture (20 studies, n=58,573) with a RR 0.89, (95% CI
0.81, 0.96), reduced the risk of vertebral fracture (12 studies,
n=48967) with a RR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.74, 1.00) and had no
effect on hip or forearm fractures (13 studies, n=56,648; RR

Calcium with
vitamin D
• A meta-analysis showed that calcium and vitamin D led to a
modest reduction in fracture risk especially those at highest
risk of calcium and/or vitamin D deficiency226 [Level 1++]
• Among institutionalised and community dwelling older
adults, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation significantly
reduced risk of total fractures by 15% (summary relative risk
estimate [SRRE] 0.85, 95% CI 0.73,0.98) and hip fractures by
30% (SRRE 0.70, 95% CI 0.56, 0.87)56 [Level 1++]
Vitamin D
• Adequate levels could reduce falls in the elderly which
indirectly influences the risk of fracture. Its effect was
through improvement of muscle strength, gait, and
balance221 [Level 1+]
Safety of calcium and Vitamin D supplementation
Calcium supplements are associated with gastrointestinal side-effects, and a small
increased risk of renal stones. There is inadequate evidence that calcium and/or
vitamin D supplementation increases cardiovascular risk.217
5.12 Activated Vitamin D
The available activated vitamin D analogues are calcitriol and alfacalcidol. Calcitriol
(0.25 µg bd) has been demonstrated to increase BMD in those with postmenopausal
osteoporosis227 and reduce vertebral fractures.228 [Level 1+] Alfacalcidol (1 µg od) has
been shown to increase BMD in those with postmenopausal osteoporosis229,230 [Level
1+] and was effective in reducing the incidence of hip fractures in older people with and
without pre-existing osteoporotic fractures.231 [Level 1++]
In a comparative meta-analysis, combining the activated vitamin D analogues
(alfacalcidol and calcitriol) were found to be superior to native vitamin D with regard to
effects on lumbar spine bone loss and spinal fracture rates in primary osteoporosis.232
[Level 1++]
In a network meta-analysis of 13 randomised controlled trials, which included
patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis and those on glucocorticoids, results
indicate that combining treatment with alendronate and alfacalcidol was significantly
better in preventing bone fractures than alendronate alone (OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.190.95) and alfacalcidol alone (Odds ratio [OR]=0.25, 95% CI: 0.08- 0.49).233 [Level 1+]

Hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia may complicate therapy with active vitamin D
analogues. All patients on activated Vitamin D should avoid taking more than 500 mg
of calcium supplements daily to reduce the risk of hypercalcaemia and renal stone
disease. Serum calcium should be monitored periodically, at minimum before starting
therapy, and at 3- to 6-monthly intervals thereafter.235 In addition, measurement of 24hour urinary calcium can be considered in those on calcitriol, especially in those with
renal impairment.236
However, most of the trials with activated vitamin D analogues involved a small
number of subjects and were of relatively short duration. This limited evidence
precludes the inclusion of activated vitamin D analogues in the routine management of
postmenopausal osteoporosis. We suggest that activated vitamin D analogues can be
considered when patients are risk of fracture are unable to tolerate other recommended
active osteoporosis therapies, i.e. SERMs, bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide,
romosuzomab, or if these therapies are unavailable. [Grade D, Level 4]
5.13 Treatment failure
Recommendations
• Treatment failure can be considered when two or more
osteoporotic fractures occur and/or <25% change in bone turnover
markers and/or worsening BMD during treatment
• Before considering treatment changes, patients need to be
assessed for treatment adherence, and for the possibility of
secondary osteoporosis
Grade C
Grade B
The aim of osteoporosis treatment is to minimise fracture risk. The available antiosteoporosis medication has been shown to reduce fracture risk by 40-70% but do not
eliminate the risk. Patients who are on osteoporosis therapy may still develop fractures
and this may reflect ‘residual disease’.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS
Treatment failure may be considered with the occurrence of,49 [Grade C, Level 4]
• ≥2 osteoporotic fractures occurring during treatment
• when serial measurements of bone remodelling markers,
- <25% reduction from baseline after six months for anti-resorptive therapy
- <25% increase after six months for anabolic therapy
• where BMD continues to decrease
- ≥5% in at least two serial BMD measurements at the lumbar spine or 4% at the
proximal femur
Before concluding that a treatment has failed, the following factors listed in Table 5-4
should be addressed, as these factors may account for the undesirable outcome as
mentioned.
Table 5-4. Factors that should be addressed before concluding treatment failure
Duration of

[Grade C]
• The change in BMD occurs with at least 12 months
of treatment with most osteoporosis therapy. If the
fracture occurs within the first treatment year, there is
no reason to change therapy
Adherence to

[Level 2++]240
[Level 1-]
• The adherence to osteoporosis therapy is suboptimal
with adherence rates ranging between 12.9-94%, which
reduces notably over time
• Poor medication adherence is associated with increased
fracture rate by 30% at any skeletal site
• Adherence should be evaluated at each clinic visit or
through the dedicated fracture liaison service

[Level 2+]
• Vitamin D deficiency accelerates bone loss and can
lead to osteomalacia, muscle weakness and secondary
hyperparathyroidism
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
The following recommendations for switching anti-osteoporosis medication could be
considered if the initial treatment has failed.49 [Level 4]
1. A weaker anti-resorptive to be replaced by a more potent drug of the same class,
e.g. alendronate in preference to ibandronate
2. An oral drug to be replaced by an injected drug, e.g. ZA or denosumab in preference
to alendronate
3. A strong anti-resorptive is reasonably replaceable by an anabolic agent (or
dual action therapy), e.g. r-PTH/teriparatide or romosozumab in preference to
denosumab
In patients with severe osteoporosis with multiple osteoporotic fractures, a more
potent agent should be initiated and an anabolic agent should be preferred to
minimise subsequent fractures and treatment failure. To date, combination anabolic/
anti-resorptive therapy is not recommended until its effect on fracture risk is better
understood.13,246 The most promising combination therapy tested is the concomitant
use of r-PTH/teriparatide and denosumab as reported in the DATA study.247,248 [Grade A,
Level 1++] A total of 94 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were randomised to
receive either teriparatide, denosumab, or both medications for 24 months. Compared
to a single drug, the combination therapy reported a higher increase in spine and hip
BMD, especially apparent in the first 12 months of treatment.

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF
OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES
SECTION 6:
Recommendations
• Osteoporotic hip fractures are best treated by early (<48 hours)
surgical intervention
• Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be initially treated
conservatively; vertebral augmentation procedures can be
considered in specific circumstances if conservative treatment fails
• Following surgical treatment for osteoporotic fractures, all patients
should receive active management for osteoporosis
Grade B
Grade A
Grade A
Surgical treatment goals in osteoporotic fractures are early weight bearing/
mobilisation and a return to normal activities.
Osteoporotic hip fractures are best treated by early (<48 hours) surgical intervention.249
[Level 2+] When there is an operative delay of >48 hours, a meta-analysis found that
the odds ratio for 30-day mortality was 1.41 (95% CI = 1.29-1.54, P < 0.001), and that
for one-year mortality was 1.32 (95% CI = 1.21-1.43, P < 0.001).250 [Level 2++] Nonoperative management is discouraged as it places the patient at risk of complications
due to immobility (e.g. respiratory problems, thromboembolic disease, pressure
ulcers, further bone loss) and mortality.251,252 Intracapsular hip fractures are treated
with a total hip replacement or arthroplasty; trochanteric fractures above and
including the lesser trochanter can be treated using a sliding hip screw in preference
to an intramedullary nail; subtrochanteric fractures are treated with an intramedullary
nail.253
Vertebral compression fractures are associated with increased morbidity and
mortality.254 However, most osteoporotic vertebral fractures are stable.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
The initial management of an acute vertebral fracture include pain control and activity
modification. Oral analgesics (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])
are usually the first option for acute pain relief; if the pain does not improve after the
initial treatment, mild opioids combined with paracetamol can be tried. For patients
debilitated by pain, hospitalisation and parenteral analgesia may be necessary.
Patients should resume physical activity as quickly as possible. Complete bedrest is
not recommended, as inactivity may result in further bone loss and deconditioning.
Physical therapy is recommended for gait and core strengthening when the patient can
tolerate this level of activity.255 Exercise may improve mobility and reduce pain and fear
of falling.256 There is limited/low quality evidence on the efficacy of spinal orthoses for
the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.257,258
For those patients who have persistent spinal pain and not settling on conservative
treatment, operative vertebral augmentation intervention can be considered.259 Other
indications for vertebral surgery include vertebral fractures complicated by the spinal
cord or nerve root compression, or progressive spinal deformities. [Grade C, Level 4]
The surgical options are as follows:
• Vertebroplasty, a percutaneous injection of cement augmentation of the vertebra
has produced quick and significant relief of backache in selected cases.260,261
[Grade B, Level 3] However, more recent guidelines have suggested that it has no
demonstrable clinically significant benefit on pain, physical function and quality of
life compared to placebo/sham procedure256 [Level 1++]
• Balloon kyphoplasty is performed by inserting a balloon-like device in the fractured
vertebrae which is inflated to increase the height of the vertebral body. However,
there is insufficient evidence to support kyphoplasty over nonsurgical management
or percutaneous vertebroplasty256 [Level 1++]
All patients with osteoporotic fractures are at high risk for the development of further
fractures. They should receive active management for osteoporosis (see Section 5) and
advised regarding prevention of falls (see Section 4.3).

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP)
Recommendations
• All patients starting glucocorticoids and in whom it is anticipated
that they will be continuing for more than three months should have
an initial fracture risk assessment
• The presence of a previous fragility fracture, bone density
measurement by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and the
glucocorticoid-adjusted Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®)
scores are used to assess fracture risk in patients on glucocorticoids
• For patients on glucocorticoids with osteoporotic fractures,
densitometric osteoporosis and/or very high fracture risk, oral
bisphosphonates are the first line treatment
Grade D ☑
Grade D ☑
Grade A
Osteoporosis is a major complication of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. Patients on
glucocorticoid therapy are at increased risk of sustaining fractures over and above that
of the underlying disorder. [Level 2+]
Bone loss occurs most rapidly in the first 6-12 months of oral GC therapy,262,263 and
is more pronounced in trabecular bone, which is predominantly present in spine.264
[Level 1++] There is an increase in fracture risk that appears within 3-6 months of
starting GC.263 [Level 1++]
Fractures occur in patients with GIOP at a higher bone mineral density measurement
(BMD) compared to postmenopausal osteoporosis.265 [Level 2++] Prednisolone ≥2.5 mg
daily or its equivalent, for >3 months is associated with low BMD and fractures.266
[Level 1++] A high daily dose of oral GC (≥15 mg) or a cumulative GC dose of ≥1 g has
been found to be associated with a higher hip fracture risk.267 [Level 2++] Standard
doses of inhaled or topical GC use for a few years have not been shown to adversely
affect BMD.268,269 [Level 1++] However, inhaled high potency GC (>600-2000 mcg),270,271
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
total cumulative dose of inhaled GC272 [Level 1++] and/or taken over an extended
period time (>8 years)271 have been associated with significant bone loss/fracture.
[Level 2+]
7.1.1 Assessment of fracture risk and diagnosis
The use of BMD measurement for the diagnosis of GIOP is not crucial, but may be
useful in the monitoring of therapy and as part of the fracture risk assessment tool.
Assessment of fracture risk should be performed in all individuals committed or likely
to receive oral GC for ≥3 months.273 [Grade D, Level 4]
In the 2017 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the prevention and
treatment of GIOP, patients are divided into those aged below and above 40 years.
Clinical risk factors and GC-adjusted Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) scores are
used to categorise patients into low, medium and high-risk groups with respect to the
10-year risk of fracture.274 The classification of low, medium and high fracture risk is
shown in Table 7-1.

For medium doses (2.5-7.5 mg daily), the unadjusted FRAX® value can be used.275
However, FRAX® cannot be adjusted to account for the cumulative dosage or length
of use.276
Patients with a low fracture risk can be monitored. Patients with a moderate or high
fracture risk are recommended to start treatment depending on the age, gender and
childbearing potential in females (see Algorithm B).
The National Osteoporosis Guideline Group suggests that in general, women age ≥70
years, or with a previous fragility fracture, or taking large doses of GC (≥7.5 mg/day
of prednisolone or equivalent/day) exceed the intervention threshold and should be
considered for bone protective therapy.277 [Grade D, Level 4]

7.1.2 Management of GIOP
General measures [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
• Prescribing the lowest effective dose of GC for disease control278
• Optimise treatment of the underlying disease262
• The use of alternative route of administration278 (e.g. inhaled steroids in asthma)
• Consider the use of steroid-sparing agents
• Modification of lifestyle – adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, regular exercise,
avoid smoking, limiting alcohol, and prevention of falls274
Specific measures
All patients on GC should be supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (1000-1200 mg/
day and 800 IU/day respectively), with the aim to achieve a serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D
[25(OH)D] level of ≥50 nmol/L (≥20 ng/mL).274,279 [Grade A, Level 1++]
In hypogonadal states, replacement therapy with sex steroids should be considered.280-282

The medications shown in Table 7-3 are effective at reducing bone loss in patients
on GC compared to placebo (which typically consists of calcium and/or vitamin D
supplements). There have been a few head-to head studies.
• In a 1-year study on primary and secondary prevention, one dose of intravenous
(IV) zoledronic acid (ZA) significantly increased lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD
compared to daily oral risedronate303
• In a 3-year study on secondary prevention, patients on recombinant human PTH 1-34
(r-PTH/teriparatide) had greater increases in lumbar spine, femoral neck and total
hip BMD compared to those on alendronate302
• Two other studies have looked at denosumab compared to alendronate and
risedronate
- In a secondary prevention study, one year of denosumab 60 mg every six months,
compared with alendronate 70 mg/week significantly increased lumbar spine, but
not femoral neck or total hip BMD, after adjusting for baseline BMD values, age,
sex, osteoporosis risk factors and the cumulative prednisolone doses received in
one year292
- In a 2-year study of both primary and secondary prevention, denosumab 60 mg
every six months led to significantly greater gain in lumbar spine and total hip BMD
compared to risedronate 5 mg daily293
In patients who have had a sub-optimal response to bisphosphonates, switching over to
denosumab for one year led to a significant greater gain in lumbar spine BMD compared
to continuing with the bisphosphonate, after adjusting for confounding factors. There
was no difference in hip BMD.304
SECTION 7: SECONDARY OSTEOPOROSIS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
A reduction in vertebral fracture rates with have been shown with alendronate,283
denosumab,284 risedronate301 and r-PTH/teriparatide293 treatment. A meta-regression
analysis suggested that alendronate is most efficacious in reducing vertebral fracture
in patients on higher daily doses of GC, >7.5 mg daily compared to those on lower doses
of GC.305 In addition, a matched cohort-analysis also showed a reduction in hip fractures
with alendronate and risedronate treatment.299
The treatment pathways are shown in Algorithm B.
• Treatment options depend on fracture risk (low/moderate/high), age (below or above
40 years) and childbearing potential
• Patients with a low fracture risk can be monitored with yearly clinical fracture risk
assessment and BMD testing every 1-2 years depending on risk factors
• For patients with moderate to high risk, oral bisphosphonates are the first option
• Women of childbearing potential need to be counselled on not planning a pregnancy
during treatment of GIOP as none of the drugs are recommended during pregnancy.
• Treatment should be continued as long as patients are on GC273 [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]
After discontinuation of GC therapy, fracture risk decreases gradually towards
baseline,306 with most of the excess fracture risk disappearing within one year of
stopping.266 [Level 2++] Fracture risk should be re-assessed when GC is stopped;
for those who remain at moderate to high risk, treatment should be continued until
fracture risk is assessed to be low.274 [Grade D, Level 4]
7.2 Renal osteodystrophy
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 15.48% adults in Malaysia in 2018.307 Mineral
and bone disorder (MBD) is a common complication of CKD particularly in those
on dialysis. Patients with CKD stages 1-2 and stages 3a-3b with normal parathyroid
hormone levels, with osteoporosis and/or high risk of fracture should be managed as
the general population.308,309 [Grade B, Level 1++] For patients with more advanced
CKD, the mainstay of treatment is to address the metabolic abnormalities associated
with renal impairment, namely correction of acidosis, hyperphosphatemia and
hypocalcaemia. [Grade D, Level 2++] Please refer to the 2017 KDIGO-CKD guidelines
on MBD for further details on the management of CKD-MBD.310

MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
7.3 Amenorrhoea
Extreme physical activity (leading to amenorrhoea in women), anorexia nervosa
and hypogonadal disorders in young women may be associated with low BMD. Bone
loss in amenorrhoeic women show the same pattern as in postmenopausal women.
Treatment is with hormone replacement.311 [Grade A, Level 1+] For patients with
anorexia nervosa, weight loss should be reversed312 and transdermal estrogen has
been shown to increase BMD in mature adolescents.313 [Grade A, Level 1+]
7.4 Drugs that induce osteoporosis
Drugs that can cause alteration in bone metabolism include glucocorticoids,
gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, aromatase inhibitor, anti-convulsant,
anti-retroviral drugs, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, thiazolidinediones, exchange resins and
long-term heparin. All patients should be encouraged to remain physically active and
consume 800 IU vitamin D and 1000 mg calcium daily. If fracture risk is high, treatment
with approved drugs should be considered. [Grade B, Level 1++]

OSTEOPOROSIS IN MEN
SECTION 8:
30% of hip fractures affect men314 and they have a higher mortality from it than
women.315,316 65% of osteoporosis in men is due to secondary causes317 of which 20% is
due to hypogonadism.318
8.1 Screening, clinical assessment and investigations for
osteoporosis in men
The relationship between bone mineral density measurement (BMD) and fracture
risk is considered to be similar in men and women. Osteoporosis screening tools
for men may be useful to identify those that would likely have osteoporosis by BMD
measurements.336-338 Screening BMD is recommended by the Endocrine Society,
International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) and National Osteoporosis
Foundation (NOF) for all men ≥70 years old, or earlier if there are concomitant risk
factors.105,319,320 [Grade C, Level 4] Fracture risk can be calculated using the Fracture
Risk Assessment Risk (FRAX®) calculator. Smoking and alcohol use disorder, which are
risk factors for osteoporosis are more prevalent among men than women.320
Clinical, laboratory, and radiological assessments for osteoporosis in men are generally
similar to women, but include assessment for male hypogonadism and/or androgen
deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (see Algorithm C for the management of male
osteoporosis).
8.2 Treatment of osteoporosis in men
Treatment of osteoporosis in men is similar to postmenopausal osteoporosis. Consider,
• Non-pharmacologic treatment: with emphasis on addressing smoking and alcohol
use disorder when present319 [Grade C, Level 2++]
• Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation: with supplementary calcium if dietary
calcium is insufficient (see Table 5-3)319 [Grade C, Level 2++]
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 8: OSTEOPOROSIS IN MEN
• Pharmacological treatments which have shown to increase BMD and reduce fractures
in men,
- Bisphosphonates: alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid have been shown to
increase bone density at lumbar spine and femoral neck in men, as well as reduce
the risk of vertebral fracture in men321-323 [Grade A, Level 1++]
- Denosumab has been shown to increase bone density at the lumbar spine and
femoral neck in men, but has no data on fracture risk reduction in men324,325
[Grade B, Level 1++]
- Teriparatide has been shown to increase bone density at the lumbar spine and
femoral neck in men, but has no data on fracture risk reduction in men326 [Grade
B, Level 1++]
Follow up and surveillance for men with osteoporosis are similar with women (see
Sections 3.6 and 5.13). [Grade D, Level 4, ☑]

FRACTURE LIAISON SERVICE
SECTION 9:
Sustaining a fragility fracture increases the risk of another fracture by at least twofold.327 However, this risk is not constant and is highest in the following 12 months after
an index fracture.327
Despite the urgency to minimise future fracture risk, many individuals do not receive
the necessary evaluation and appropriate secondary prevention.328-330
Fracture Liaison Service (FLS)331 is a care-coordinator-based secondary fracture
prevention programme. FLS systematically identifies, assesses, investigates, and
appropriately treats patients with fragility fractures.
The role of the FLS
• Identification of individuals with fragility fractures within the healthcare
institution (e.g. inpatient trauma wards, Emergency Department, or
orthopaedic clinics)
• Evaluation of future fracture risk according to locally agreed protocols and
guidelines
• Timely assessment of bone fragility (bone mineral density [BMD] assessment
and secondary causes of osteoporosis) and falls risk
• Initiation of treatment
• Treatment review and appropriate follow up plan
• Patient education on optimising bone health
• Data and record keeping for audit and assessment of quality standards
Adapted from Chan DDC, et al. Arch Osteoporosis 2018.331
FLS requires a multi-disciplinary approach,332 An effective FLS requires coordination
with other healthcare professionals and services including bone densitometry
services, specialist fall clinics, access to primary care, orthopaedic units and clinicians
with osteoporosis expertise.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)
SECTION 9: FRACTURE LIAISON SERVICE
Initiating and sustaining FLS require333 leadership, organisational support, stakeholder
engagement and investment of resources (infrastructure, staff, and support systems).
Successful FLS has been shown to,332
• Increase the number of BMD testing performed
• Increase treatment initiation
• Improve treatment persistence
• Reduce re-fracture rates by half
FLS has been demonstrated to be cost-effective, supporting its place as an effective
secondary prevention strategy.333 A stepwise implementation has been suggested to
allow systematic scaling up of FLS (Figure 9-A).334

IMPLEMENTING THE
GUIDELINES
SECTION 11:
Implementation of the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) is important as it helps in
providing quality healthcare services based on best available evidence applied to
the local scenario and expertise. Various factors and resource implications should be
considered for the success of the uptake in the CPG recommendations.
11.1 Facilitating and limiting factors
The existing facilitating factors in implementing the recommendations in the CPG are:
• Availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and softcopies)
• Regular conferences and updates on management of osteoporosis led by the
Malaysian Osteoporosis Society and involving other professional societies or bodies
(Malaysian Endocrine and Metabolic Society, Menopause Society of Malaysia,
Academy of Family Physicians Malaysia, Malaysian Orthopaedic Association,
Malaysian Society of Geriatric Medicine, Malaysian Society of Rheumatology)
• Public awareness campaigns on osteoporosis on World Osteoporosis Day and at
other relevant times of the year
The existing limiting factors in implementing the recommendations in the CPG are:
• Different levels of care and wide variation in practice due to expertise, facilities and
financial constraints
• Lack of awareness among healthcare providers on the importance of treatment of
osteoporosis in high-risk patients
• Lack of awareness among the general public on the importance of bone health as
they age
11.2 Potential resource implications
To implement the CPG, there must be dedicated efforts to:
• Ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers
• Provide regular training to healthcare providers via effective seminars and workshops
• Involve multidisciplinary team at all levels of health care
• Encourage the formation of Fracture Liaison Services in all major hospitals that treat
osteoporotic fractures

Appendix 2. Bone mineral density measurement at various skeletal sites
Region of interest
Measurement
Spine
• Use PA L1-L4 for spine BMD measurement
• Use all evaluable vertebrae and only exclude those that
are affected by local structural change or artifact – use 3
vertebrae if 4 cannot be used; use 2 if 3 cannot be used
• The T-score is only derived from the BMD of the evaluable
vertebrae – do not use the BMD of excluded vertebrae
• BMD-based diagnostic classification should not be made
using a single vertebra. If only one evaluable vertebra
remains after exclusion of others, base the diagnosis on a
different valid skeletal site
• Anatomically abnormal vertebrae may be excluded from
analysis if it is clearly abnormal and non-assessable within
the resolution of the system and there is >1.0 T-score
difference between the vertebra in question and the one
adjacent to it
• The lateral spine should not be used for diagnosis but may
have a role in monitoring
Hip
• Use the femoral neck or total proximal femur, whichever is
the lowest
• BMD can be measured at either hip. However, there are
insufficient data to determine if mean T-scores from both
hip BMDs can be utilised for diagnosis
• The mean hip BMD can be used for monitoring, with total
hip preferred
Forearm
• Use 1/3rd radius of the non-dominant forearm for
diagnosis as the dominant forearm is not recommended
BMD, bone mineral density; PA: posterior-anterior.

Appendix 4. Falls evaluation parameters
Evaluation of falls should include the following parameters
Parameters
Focus
Focused history on
fall incidents
• Frequency of falls
• Activity during the fall
• Presence of any prodromal symptoms before the fall
• Where and when the falls occurred
• History of unexplained falls or transient loss of
consciousness should prompt further assessment
of cardiovascular disorders such as carotid sinus
hypersensitivity, vasovagal syndrome and arrhythmias,
and neurological disorders
Medication review
• Focus specifically on falls risk increasing drugs, such as
cardiovascular agents, psychotropic medications, analgesia,
and antidiabetic medications
Assessment and
identification of
acute or chronic
medical illnesses
• Especially age-related degenerative conditions such as
Parkinson’s disease, chronic musculoskeletal pain, knee
osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, stroke, and diabetes
mellitus
Assessment
of sensory
impairment
and functional
assessment
• Include visual acuity and hearing impairment screening
• For the older adults assess their activities of daily living,
use of assistive devices and perceived fear of falling within
their environment
Examination
• Examine the gait and balance with Timed up and Go Test
(TUG Test)
• Neurological status and cognitive screening
• Cardiovascular assessment – heart rate, rhythm, postural
blood pressure and baseline electrocardiogram

Appendix 5. Staging and descriptions of osteonecrosis of the jaw
Stage
Description
0 – Non-exposed
bone variant
Patients with no clinical evidence of necrotic bone, but who
present with non-specific symptoms or clinical and radiographic
findings, such as:
Symptoms:
• Odontalgia not explained by an odontogenic cause
• Dull, aching bone pain in the jaw, which may radiate to the
temporomandibular joint region
• Sinus pain, which may be associated with inflammation and
thickening of the maxillary sinus wall
• Altered neurosensory function
Clinical findings
• Loosening of teeth not explained by chronic periodontal
disease
• Periapical/periodontal fistula that is not associated with
pulpal necrosis due to caries, trauma or restorations
Radiographic findings
• Alveolar bone loss or resorption not attributable to chronic
periodontal disease
• Changes to trabecular pattern–dense bone and no new bone
in extraction sockets
• Regions of osteosclerosis involving the alveolar bone and/or
the surrounding basilar bone
• Thickening/obscuring of periodontal ligament (thickening
of the lamina dura, sclerosis and decreased size of the
periodontal ligament space)
1
Exposed and necrotic bone or fistula that probes to bone,
in patients who are asymptomatic and have no evidence of
infection. These patients may also present with radiographic
findings mentioned for stage 0 which are localised to the
alveolar bone region.
