STATEMENT OF INTENT
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES
This Guidelines was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the
management of Non- ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS). This is
a combination of both Unstable Angina (UA) and Non-ST Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (NSTEMI). It is based on the best evidence currently available. Adherence
to this Guidelines does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual
patient care. Thus, every health care provider is responsible for the management of
his/her unique patient, based on the clinical presentation and management options
available locally.
This Guidelines was issued in 2021 and will be reviewed in 2026 or earlier if
important new evidence becomes available.

Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome
(NSTE-ACS) accounted for 55.4% of all Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS) reported from the National Cardiovascular
Disease Database (NCVD) - ACS Registry between 2016 and
2017. NSTE-ACS including the non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina
is the dominant clinical manifestation of ACS in Malaysia hence ensuring the standardised
and current clinical management for our clinicians is paramount for the safety of our patients.
A multi-pronged approach has seen improvement in the management of ACS over the last
decade, in line with the development of both treatments and healthcare service delivery.
However, since the publication of the previous Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the
management of NSTE-ACS in 2011, new diagnostic and therapeutic measures have been
introduced and practised. Therefore, the publication of the refreshed version of the 2021
Third Edition Clinical Practice Guideline on the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial
Infarction is timely.
Amongst the areas of focus in this brand-new CPG would be the in pre-hospital care, the
use of cardiac troponins in the diagnostic work-up, a greater emphasis on risk stratification
scores early in the inpatient management, and also the recommendation of an early
invasive strategy for patients at the highest risk of adverse outcomes.
I am delighted with the research contribution by the various clinical and academic groups
for the reference in this CPG, and I encourage such endeavours to continue for the
improvement in both care and outcomes in patients. This CPG complements others that
focus on the risk factors associated with the condition, including its sister condition,
ST-elevation ACS in the CPG STEMI, 2019.
I thank the members of the Expert Panel and the External Reviewers, drawn from both the
public and private sector of the Malaysian healthcare ecosystem, for their tireless work to
produce this CPG. I would also like to acknowledge the National Heart Association of
Malaysia and my colleagues at the Ministry of Health Malaysia for publishing this important
update on the management of NSTE-ACS, 2021.

Rationale:
Ischemic Heart disease is the main cause of mortality in Malaysia. Data from our
National Cardiovascular Disease Database - Acute Coronary Syndrome
(NCVD-ACS) Registry showed that the in-hospital, one month and 1-year mortality
following NSTE-ACS is higher than that of other international registries. Thus, an
update to our 2011 Clinical Practice Guidelines is timely.
This CPG consists of statements that include recommendations intended to optimize
patient care guided by a systematic review of evidence and assessment of the
benefits and harms of alternative care options, reflecting the latest literature, expert
consensus, and wherever possible, public stakeholder comment.
This Guidelines has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the
National Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The
committee members were multidisciplinary and comprised cardiologists, internal,
emergency and family medicine specialists and cardiac rehabilitation physicians
from the government, private sector and universities. The external reviewers were
also multidisciplinary and in addition to specialists, general practitioners were also
included. Stakeholders - members of the general public - were also included as
external reviewers.
The committee made use of the following resources in developing this CPG :-
 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association
(2010) Methodology manual and policies from the ACCF/AHA Task Force on
Practice Guidelines
 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Governing Policies and Procedures for
the Writing of ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines and
 the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation [ AGREE II ] Tool
Objectives:
The objectives of this Guidelines are to provide guidance on:
 Systematic evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain to the Emergency
Department to reduce the number of “missed Myocardial Infarctions”.
 Evidence-based therapeutic strategies in patients with NSTE-ACS to reduce
the risk of recurrent Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE).
 Strategies to optimize patient care and reduce potential harm among the
different subsets of patients with NSTE-ACS within the existing local frame-work
of healthcare.

Process:
A review was carried out of the medical literature on Myocardial Infarction (MI)/Non
ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome / Non ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI) / Unstable
Angina (UA)/Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) published since the issuing of the
last CPG in 2011.
Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases - PubMed
and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was conducted for the
period 2011 till 31st August 2019. The following MeSH terms or free text terms were
used either singly or in combination:
“Acute Coronary Syndrome”,”ACS”, “Myocardial infarction (MI)”; “NSTEMI”; Non ST
Elevation Myocardial Infarction;” “UA”,” Unstable Angina”,”Non ST Elevation Acute
Coronary syndrome”, “NSTE-ACS” “definition of MI”; “Myocardial injury”, “ECG
criteria of NSTE-ACS”,”Rule out Protocols for ACS”; “Risk Scores for ACS”, “cardiac
troponins”, “Pre-hospital Management of ACS”; “Oxygen therapy in ACS”; “Risk
stratification scores in NSTE-ACS”; “Cardiac rehabilitation”, “secondary prevention
post NSTE-ACS”, “management of NSTE-ACS in women, the elderly, persons with
chronic renal disease.”
The search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and
published in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from
this huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were
searched to identify further studies. Regional CPGs were also studied. Experts in the
field were also contacted to obtain further information. International Guidelines
mainly that from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart
Association (ACCF/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used
as references.
The literature retrieved was appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all
statements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The
systemic reviews were conducted “in-house” and the committee appraised the
quality of evidence collectively. The evidence was not systematically assessed for
consistency, precision and directness. However, each of these attributes were
implicitly judged when the committee appraised and graded the evidence and wrote
the level of recommendation. The recommendations of the other international bodies
– ACCF/ACC, ESC and The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) Guidelines-were also studied to determine their applicability to the local
population and heathcare.
The grading of the evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG as
outlined in page 16, were adopted from that used by the American College of

Cardiology Foundation/ American Heart Association 2010 Methodology Manual and
Policies by the ACCF/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the European
Society of Cardiology Governing Policies and Procedures for Writing ESC Clinical
Practice Guidelines 2017.
After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical
Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health
personnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector and general
public for review and feedback.
Clinical Questions Addressed:
There were several topics and subtopics that were formulated addressing the
diagnosis and management of NSTE-ACS (UA+ NSTEMI)
For diagnosis:
In a person presenting with chest pain/ chest pain equivalent:
 What features in the history would make one suspect this patient is having an
ACS?
 In a patient with suspected ACS, how do you differentiate NSTE-ACS and
STEMI based on:
 ECG
 Cardiac biomarkers - cardiac troponins/ Creatine Kinase Myocardial Band
(CKMB). How useful are these?
 Is there a role for cardiac troponins to be available in primary healthcare
(cost-effectiveness)?
 Echocardiogram: is it a useful diagnostic tool?
 Which patients presenting with chest pain in the ED can be safely sent home?
 How do we risk stratify patients with NSTE-ACS?
 Which patients require urgent referral for cardiac catheterization?
For therapy, the topics and subtopics were formulated using the PICO method as
follows:
P: Population - Persons with NSTE-ACS and risk stratified using either the TIMI or
GRACE scores (Appendix IV and V, page 96 and 97) and at:
 Low risk of MACE
 Intermediate risk of MACE
 High risk of MACE
 Very high risk of MACE

Type of Question - Involves:
 Therapy - Pharmacotherapy, PCI
 Harm -
 Increase in cardiovascular disease event rate (MACE -MI, heart failure, stroke,
CVD death)
 Increase in bleeding risk and stroke rate
 Adverse effects due pharmacotherapy
 Prognosis - Reduction in MACE-MI, heart failure, stroke, CVD death and
improvement in all-cause mortality
Type of Study
 Systematic review and meta-analysis
 Randomised controlled studies
 Cohort studies
 Registry data
Thus, there were numerous clinical questions formulated.
Examples of some of these Clinical Questions:
1. In a patient presenting with NSTE-ACS and with ongoing chest pains and at low
risk of MACE (Major Cardiovascular Outcomes) is the administration of intravenous
morphine for pain relief as compared to a non opiate, effective and safe?
2. In a patient presenting with NSTE-ACS and at low risk of MACE, taking into
consideration the patient’s bleeding risks (as assessed by the PRECISE-DAPT
score, Appendix VI page 98), are double antiplatelet agents more effective than a
single antiplatelet agent, in reducing:
 MI, heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD) death
 All-cause mortality
3. Would an initial interventional therapy when compared to intensive medical
therapy alone in a patient presenting with NSTE-ACS and at low risk of MACE
result in a reduction in:
 MI, heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD) death
 All-cause mortality.
4. Would an initial interventional therapy when compared to intensive medical
therapy alone in a patient presenting with NSTE-ACS and at very high risk of
MACE result in a reduction in:
 MI, heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD) death
 All-cause mortality.

Target Group:
This Guidelines is directed at all healthcare providers including general practitioners,
medical officers, general, family and emergency physicians and cardiologists.
Target Population:
All patients (older than 18 years) presenting with chest pain and who have been
diagnosed to have NSTE-ACS based on the history, ECG and cardiac biomarkers.
Period of Validity of the Guidelines:
This guideline needs to be revised at least every 5 years or sooner if significant
changes have occurred, or new data is available that would influence the
recommendations made.
Applicability of the Guidelines:
This Guidelines was developed taking into account our local healthcare resources.
The following are available at all specialist government hospitals.
 ECG machines, measurement of cardiac biomarkers (including troponins),
treadmill stress ECG’s and echocardiograms.
 We have recommended that all specialist hospitals have facilities to measure
cardiac troponins (preferably high sensitivity cardiac troponins). This should
preferably be lab-based (depending on volume) or at least point of care (POC)
kits. Cardiac troponins should replace the measurement of “cardiac enzymes”-
lactate dehydrogenase, transaminases and creatine kinase.
 Most of the medications that are recommended in this Guidelines are already
present in the Malaysian standard drug formulary.
 Very high risk/high risk patients should be identified early and transferred to
hospitals with existing catheterization facilities. In accordance with the national
health plan, the ministry has already proposed the setting up of catheterization
laboratories in most of the state hospitals.
This Guidelines aims to streamline management of cardiac patients and educate
healthcare professional on strategies to optimize existing resources. We do not
anticipate barriers to its implementation.

Implementation of the Guidelines:
The implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical
governance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:
 Increasing public awareness of CAD and its therapies.
 Continuing medical education and training of healthcare providers.
 Clinical audit - This is done by monitoring:
 In - hospital mortality and morbidity in patients admitted with NSTE-ACS
(NCVD-ACS registry)
 Readmission rates for a cardiac related event in patients discharged with a
diagnosis of NSTE-ACS. Elective admissions for cardiac procedures are
excluded.
 Documentation of the following;
– In patients suspected of ACS, measurement and documentation of the
Heart Score of the individual at ED.
– Percentage of high-risk patients having their coronary angiogram
performed < 48 hours when admitted to a PCI capable hospital.
– In patients discharged with a diagnosis of NSTE-ACS,
• Medications at discharge:
 Aspirin

P2Y12 inhibitor
 high intensity statins
• Referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program

SUMMARY
Epidemiology:
 Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) remains the principal cause of death in Malaysia.
 The Malaysian NCVD-ACS registry 2016-2017 showed that our local in-hospital,
30-day and 1-year mortality remain high despite being on a downward trend. Our
figures are higher than those in other international registries. (Table 4, page 39)
Definition:
 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a clinical spectrum of IHD that develops
because of an acute imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply.
 Depending upon the acuteness of onset and the degree of coronary occlusion, it
can range from (Flowchart 3, page 37) :
 Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS). This is a combination of:
• Unstable angina (UA) and
• Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
 In UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac biomarkers (troponins-cTn) are
normal.
 Myocardial injury results in cell necrosis and cardiac biomarkers are raised. It
may be due to severe ischemia and/or non ischemic causes (eg myocarditis).
 Myocardial Infarction (MI) is myocardial injury due to ischemia.
 According to the 4th Universal definition, MI is diagnosed when there is a significant
rise and/or fall in cTn, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper
reference limit (URL), and accompanied with at least one of the following:
 Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin of > 30 minutes.
 ECG changes of ischemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q
waves.
 Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality.
 Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
 There are no clear guidelines as to “significant rise and fall” of cTn levels. An expert
consensus committee has suggested that changes in cTn concentrations of >20%
should be used to define patients with an MI.
 MI may be STEMI or NSTE-ACS based on the ECG.
Pathogenesis:
 MI can be classified as 5 types depending on the pathology, clinical features,
prognosis and treatment strategies. (Table 6, page 41) This CPG focuses on
NSTE-ACS which is usually either:
 Type 1 MI (spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, with
ulceration, fissuring, erosion or dissection) or
MANAGEMENT OF
NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(NSTE-ACS)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
3RD EDITION

24
 Type 2 MI (often due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or
demand. It may occur in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis without
plaque rupture or in the absence of atherosclerosis). This is an important cause
of ACS in the elderly.
 The majority (66%-78%) of ACS arise from lesions with <50% stenosis and less
than 5% arise from lesions exhibiting >70% stenosis.
Diagnosis:
 The combinations of history, physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG)
are important but may be insufficient to reliably rule in or rule out NSTE-ACS.
 Cardiac troponins (cTn) T and I are the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for
myocardial injury and necrosis.
 Troponins are raised due to myocardial injury and this may be acute (associated
with a rise and fall) or chronic. There are other causes of a raised cTn besides MI.
(Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94).
 For a diagnosis of MI, the rise and fall of cTn should be accompanied by either a
clinical history consistent with MI or with ECG or echocardiographic changes
consistent with an MI or an intracoronary thrombus. (Section 2, pages 44 - 47)
 The cTn assays could be point of care (POC) kits or laboratory based. In general,
POC kits have lower analytical sensitivity and too wide coefficient of variation (CoV)
to detect troponins at the 99th URL. Almost all locally available laboratory-based
assays can measure cTn at the 99th URL.
Triage/Risk Scores:
 Patients presenting with chest pain or chest pain equivalents may, based on the
initial clinical history and ECG, have:
 Very low likelihood of NSTE-ACS or have an alternative cause for their symptoms.
These can be treated accordingly and be discharged from the Emergency
Department (ED).
 Definite NSTE-ACS or STEMI. These patients should be admitted and managed
appropriately.
 Possible or suspected NSTE-ACS. These patients have a normal or non- diagnostic
ECG and need to be evaluated using a “rule out protocol” for ACS.
 Evaluation is a continuous process and it is possible for a patient to move from
very low likelihood ACS to definite NSTE-ACS as the disease evolves.
 Patients with possible or suspected NSTE-ACS should be:
 Risk stratified using HEART (or modified HEART score) or TIMI risk scores
(Flowchart 1, page 35)
MANAGEMENT OF
NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(NSTE-ACS)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
3RD EDITION

 Evaluated using the “Rule out ACS” (Flowchart 1, page 35). Following
evaluation, these patients may be:
• Discharged from ED and referred for an early outpatient cardiology (or in
the absence of cardiology internal medicine) consult.
• Admitted
 Patients with definite NSTE-ACS should be risk stratified using either clinical
features (Table 3, page 39 ), TIMI or GRACE risk scores (Appendix IV & V, pages 96 & 97).
 This will help determine:
• The prognosis of the patient
• Management strategies
• Selection of the site of care (coronary care unit, monitored step-down ward
or outpatient setting)
• Selection of appropriate therapy and the need for coronary angiogram
and revascularization
 The risk of bleeding in a patient at high risk of bleeding should also be assessed
using the PRECISE-DAPT score (Appendix VI, page 98).
Pre- Hospital Management:
 Public awareness about heart disease should be increased so that individuals will
seek appropriate treatment early, thus reducing time from symptom onset to First
Medical Contact.
 In patients suspected of having an ACS and not on regular aspirin and with no
history of allergy, 300mg aspirin should be administered.
 Ambulance responders should be trained and equipped to perform an ECG.
 If the ECG shows STEMI or the patient with NSTE-ACS has ongoing/recurrent
chest pain, they should be considered for immediate transfer to a PCI-capable
hospital. High-risk unstable patients should be taken to the nearest hospital for
stabilization first.
In-Hospital Management:
Emergency Department
 Patients with NSTE-ACS should be given:
 Aspirin 300 mg stat (if not given earlier)
 Oxygen if oxygen sat < 95%
 Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN - as a tablet, spray or intravenous infusion) for ongoing
or recurrent chest pains
 Intravenous (i.v. morphine with i.v. anti-emetics or i.v. fentanyl) for severe chest pains
 Heparin (i.v. infusion unfractionated or subcutaneous (s.c.) low molecular weight
(LMWH)) or s.c.fondaparinux

 In the presence of ongoing chest pains and/or hemodynamic instability, urgent
coronary angiography with view to revascularization should be considered if
facilities are available.
 In patients with recurrent/ongoing chest pain not due to ACS, appropriate investi
gations need to be performed to exclude other diagnosis.
Pharmacotherapy
 Patients with NSTE-ACS should be on DAPT.
 Aspirin should be given at the time of diagnosis.
 The timing of the second antiplatelet agent will depend on the agent used. No
firm recommendations can be made about pre-treatment.
• Clopidogrel and ticagrelor, in general, can be administered early.
• Prasugrel should be given after the coronary angiogram before proceeding to PCI.
 Duration of DAPT will depend on the risk of bleeding versus the thrombotic risk.
Ideally all patients should be given for 1 year but patients with high bleeding risk
can be given DAPT for a shorter period of 3-6 months.
 Patients with NSTE-ACS treated medically (without an invasive strategy) should
be on s.c. LMWH or s.c. fondaparinux for 2-8 days or until hospital discharge.
 High dose statins should be initiated soon after diagnosis.
 In patients who have angina/ischemia, β-blockers and/or CCBs should be prescribed
as first-line treatment.
 Long-acting nitrates, trimetazidime and ranolazine are recommended as add-on
therapy in patients who remain symptomatic. Ivabradine may also be considered
for in patients with normal sinus rhythm, especially in those who have a contrain
dication to or intolerance to β-blockers and if the resting HR is above 70/min.
Revascularization
 The selection of the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography and revascu
larization should be guided by the individual’s risk for a MACE.
 Risk stratification can be done using clinical features (Table 3, page 39),TIMI or
GRACE scores (Appendix IV & V, pages 96 & 97).
 Patients at:
 very high-risk should undergo an immediate invasive strategy (<2 h).
 high risk should be recommended for an early invasive strategy (<24 h).
 intermediate risk - also recommended to undergo an invasive strategy but this
may be delayed for a maximum of 72 h window period from admission to
coronary angiography.
 Low risk patients should be assessed non-invasively for ischemia. (Flowchart 2,
page 36). If symptoms and/or myocardial ischemia are present, they should be
considered for an invasive coronary angiogram with view to revascularization.
 Wherever possible, complete revascularization should be performed either at the
initial setting or as a staged procedure.

Discharge Medications:
 Patients should be on optimal medical therapy at discharge. This includes:
 DAPT with aspirin + clopidogrel (or ticagrelor or prasugrel).
 And High intensity statins to achieve LDL-C target of < 1.8 mmol/l (preferably
< 1.4 mmol/l) or > 50% lower than baseline, whichever results in a lower level.
 And in the presence of angina /myocardial ischemia, β-blockers and/or CCBs
should be prescribed as first-line treatment and ivabradine, trimetazidine,
long-acting nitrates and ranolazine are recommended as add-on therapy in
patients who remain symptomatic.
 And in the presence of LVEF< 40% and heart failure, β-blockers, Renin
Angiotensin Blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) and Aldosterone Receptor Antagonists-
spironolactone, eplerenone - should be given. SGLT2-inhibitors can be instituted
in both stable diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
NSTE-ACS in Special Groups:
 Older persons:
 When managing older patients, one should consider the biological age rather
than the chronological age. (Section 8.1, pages 80 - 82)
 The older patient has greater in-hospital and long-term benefits with an early
invasive strategy. However, there is an increased risk of major bleeding.
 Women
 In general, women develop Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) about a decade later than
men. Premenopausal women should be managed with the same pharmacological
therapy as that for men for acute care and for secondary prevention.
 Women who are low risk and cTn negative, should be treated medically.
 Women who are cTn positive, should be considered for an invasive strategy.
 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
 In general, patients with CKD should be managed in a similar manner as those
with normal renal function.
 They, however, have a higher bleeding tendency and doses of medications
need to be adjusted according to the renal function.
 An invasive strategy is superior to a conservative strategy.The benefit, however,
declines with lower renal function, and is less certain in those with renal failure
or on dialysis.
Cardiac Rehabilitation:
 Cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce mortality by approximately
20% - 25% and a trend towards reduction in non-fatal recurrent MI.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
Key Recommendations 1:
 Wherever possible, an ECG should be performed within 10 minutes of the
First Medical Contact (FMC).
 All ambulances, government and private clinics should be equipped with
ECG-capable devices. These should have computer-generated interpretation
and wherever possible, reviewed by trained personnel.
Key Recommendations 2:
 All hospitals providing care for patients with acute chest pain or suspected MI
should have access to cTn (subtypes T or I) testing, preferably hs-cTn.
 Clinicians must be familiar with their local cTn assays-point of care (POC) kits
or laboratory based, the 99th percentile URL and the lower limit of detection
(LoD) of the assay used in their respective hospitals.
 The value of cTn should be stated and not labelled as positive or negative.
Key Recommendations 3:
 Patients presenting with chest pain and who, after initial assessment, have:
 Definite NSTE-ACS or STEMI should be admitted and managed
accordingly.
 Very low likelihood of NSTE-ACS or having an alternative cause for their
symptoms should be treated accordingly and be discharged from ED.
 Suspected ACS should:
• Have the cTn, preferably hs-cTn measured.
• Be risk stratified using the HEART or TIMI risk scores and the “Rule
out ACS” (Flowchart 1, page 35)
 Using the “Rule out ACS” (Flowchart 1, page 35) patients who are suspected
to be having ACS should be:
 Discharged from ED and referred for an early outpatient cardiology (or in
the absence of cardiology-internal medicine) consult.
 Admitted for definitive management of NSTE-ACS.

Key Recommendations 5:
 Public awareness about heart disease should be increased so that individuals
will seek appropriate treatment early, thus reducing time from symptom onset
to FMC.
 In persons with suspected NSTE-ACS, 300mg aspirin should be administered
if not on regular aspirin and with no history of allergy. Soluble and chewable
aspirin formulations are preferable to solid aspirin either chewed or swallowed.
Key Recommendations 6:
 Ambulance responders should be trained and equipped to perform an ECG.
 If the ECG shows STEMI or the patient with NSTE-ACS has ongoing/ recurrent
chest pain, they should be considered for immediate transfer to a PCI-capable
hospital.
 High-risk unstable patients should be taken to the nearest hospital for stabili
zation first.
Key Recommendations 4:
 Patients with definite NSTE-ACS should be risk stratified using clinical features
(Table 3, page 39), TIMI or GRACE risk score (Appendix IV & V, pages 96 & 97).
This will help determine:
 Prognosis of the patient
 Management strategies
 Selection of the site of care (coronary care unit, monitored step-down ward
or outpatient setting)
 Selection of appropriate therapy and the need for coronary angiogram and
revascularization
 Their bleeding risk should also be assessed preferably with the PRECISE-DAPT
score. (Appendix VI, page 98)

Key Recommendations 11:
 All patients with NSTE-ACS should be on optimal medical therapy at discharge.
This includes:
 DAPT with aspirin + clopidogrel (or ticagrelor or prasugrel)
 AND High intensity statins to achieve LDL-C target of < 1.8 mmol/l (preferably
< 1.4 mmol/l) or a 50% reduction in LDL-C levels from baseline, the lower

 AND if the LVEF< 40% and heart failure, β-blockers, Renin Angiotensin Blockers
(ACEIs/ARBs) and Aldosterone Receptor Antagonists- spironolactone,
eplerenone should be given. SGLT2-inhibitors can be instituted in both
stable diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Key Recommendations 12:
 Low risk patients should be assessed non-invasively for ischemia. (Flowchart 2,
page 36) If they have troubling symptoms and/or significant myocardial
ischemia, they should be referred for coronary angiography with view to
revascularization.
Key Recommendations 13:
 Audit of performance measures (Table 7, page 42) and outcome measures
should be performed regularly to monitor and improve quality of care.
Key Recommendations 10:
 The selection of the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography and
revascularization should be guided by the individual’s risk for a MACE.
 Risk stratification can be done by using clinical criteria, (Table 3, page 39) TIMI
score or GRACE score (Appendix IV & V, pages 96 & 97)
 Patients at:
 Very high risk should undergo an immediate invasive strategy (<2 h).
 High risk should be recommended for an early invasive strategy (<24 h).
 Intermediate risk should also be recommended to undergo an invasive
strategy but this may be delayed for a maximum of 72 h window period
from admission to coronary angiography.
 Low risk should be assessed non-invasively for ischemia.

Type 1: Spontaneous MI due to coronary athero-thrombosis
Spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, erosion, or
dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more of the coronary arteries
leading to decreased myocardial blood flow or distal platelet emboli with ensuing myocyte
necrosis.
Type 2: MI secondary to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and
supply unrelated to acute coronary athero-thrombosis
MI that occurs due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand. It
may occur in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis without plaque rupture or in the
absence of atherosclerosis e.g., coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery spasm,
coronary embolism, coronary artery dissection, tachy/bradyarrhythmias, anemia, respiratory
failure, sepsis, hypotension, and hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy
(LVH).
Type 3: MI resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable
Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemic and presumed new
ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurring before blood samples could be
obtained, before cardiac biomarker could rise, or in rare cases cardiac biomarkers were not
collected.
Type 4a: MI related to PCI
MI associated with PCI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac troponin (cTn) values 5 x
> 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values (≤ 99th percentile URL) or a rise
of cTn values > 20% if the baseline values are elevated but are stable or falling. In addition,
either
(i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, or
(ii) new ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, or
(iii) angiographic loss of patency of a major coronary artery or a side branch or persistent
slow-or no-flow or embolization, or
(iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality is required.
Type 4b: MI related to stent thrombosis
MI associated with stent thrombosis is detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the
setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers values with
at least one value above the 99th percentile URL.
Type 5: MI related to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG)
MI associated with CABG is arbitrarily deﬁned by elevation of cardiac biomarker values 10 x
99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values (99th percentile URL). In
addition, either
(i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or
(ii) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or
(iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality.

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains the principal cause of death in Malaysia. In
2017, IHD was responsible for 13.9% of deaths, followed by pneumonia (12.7%) and
cerebrovascular diseases (7.1%). It is the principal cause of death for all major
ethnic groups being highest among Indians (19.5%),13.3% Bumiputera (12.3%
Malays, others 1.01%), and 13.2% Chinese.1
Patients with IHD may present with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) - (now
called - Chronic Coronary Syndromes) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS is a
clinical spectrum from NSTE-ACS (combination of unstable angina (UA) and
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)) to ST elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI).
From the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Database Acute Coronary
Syndrome (NCVD-ACS) Registry 2016-2017: 2
 44.6% of ACS patients were STEMI.
 55.4% of ACS patients were NSTE-ACS (28.0% were NSTEMI and 27.4% were UA).
Patients with NSTE-ACS were older (60.5 vs 56.3 years), more likely females
(27.2% vs 14.2%) and had more CVD risk factors (comorbidities) compared to those
who presented with STEMI. 2
Of those presenting with NSTE-ACS:2
 42.2% were in the intermediate-high TIMI risk score
 35.1% were in the intermediate risk group - (TIMI 3 & 4)
 7.1% were in the high-risk group - (TIMI 5,6 & 7)
 The in-hospital mortality was 7.5%.
Compared to the previous registry data, our patients are now receiving more
Guideline Directed Therapy (GDT). The use of DAPT and statins were more than
90%.2 More patients underwent coronary angiography during the index admission
and 35.9% of NSTEMI and 20.2% of patients with UA had percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI).2
The in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year mortality were:2
 7.5%, 11.5% and 23.6% for NSTEMI respectively
 1.0%, 2.2% and 9.6% for UA respectively.
These figures are slightly lower than that seen in the NCVD 2014-2015 but still
higher than that of other registries.3-6 (Table 4, page 39)

The Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) on Stable Coronary Artery
Disease 2018, 2nd Ed and ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction 4th Ed, 2019 were
recently updated.7,8 The last CPG on UA/NSTEMI was published in 2011. Since then,
there have been significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology
and management. Thus, an update is timely to keep abreast with contemporary
evidence.
Key Messages 1#:
 IHD remains the principal cause of death in Malaysia.
 Our NCVD-ACS registry shows that our in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year mortality
is still high despite being lower than in previous years. Our figures are higher
than those in other international registries. (Table 4, page 39)
ACS is a clinical spectrum of IHD that develops because of an imbalance between
myocardial oxygen demand and supply. It is usually due to a reduction in supply.
Depending upon the acuteness of onset and the degree of coronary occlusion, it can
range from: (Flowchart 3, page 37)
 Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS). This is a combination of:
 Unstable angina (UA) and
 Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
The pathology is dynamic. A patient presenting with UA may progress to NSTEMI or
even STEMI.
2.1 Unstable Angina
Patients with UA are a heterogenous group. According to Braunwald’s classification,
updated in 2000, UA may be classified as (Appendix I, page 93)9 :
I.
New onset of severe angina or accelerated angina; no rest pain
II. Angina at rest, subacute - Angina at rest within past month but not within
preceding 48 hours.
III. Angina at rest, acute - Angina at rest within 48 hours
It may be further classified according to clinical circumstances into either :
A) Secondary - develops in the presence of extracardiac disease
B) Primary - develops in the absence of extracardiac disease
C) Post-infarct - develops within 2 weeks of an acute MI
In UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac biomarkers (troponins-cTn) are
normal. In myocardial injury, cardiac biomarkers are raised.

2.2 Myocardial Infarction
2.2.1 Definition of Myocardial Injury and Myocardial Infarction
It is important to distinguish between myocardial injury and Myocardial Infarction
(MI). Myocardial injury may be due to:10
 Ischemia - MI and/or
 Non-ischaemic causes (eg. myocarditis, renal failure)
MI is myocardial injury due to ischemia and is defined pathologically as myocardial
cell death due to prolonged ischemia.10
2.2.1.1 Cardiac Biomarkers in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Injury and
Myocardial Infarction
The cardiac biomarkers of choice for the diagnosis are the cardiac troponins - cTn
(both I and T), preferably high-sensitivity (hs-cTn). Elevation of cTn indicates
myocardial necrosis. A level above the 99th percentile Upper Reference Limit (URL)
is abnormal and indicative of myocardial injury.10
All locally available commercial laboratory-based assays indicate this level, the exact
value varying depending on the reagents and assays used. The point of care (POC)
kits, however, although giving a more rapid result, are not sensitive enough to detect
this low level.
With the current definition, UA patients in Braunwald’s Classification Stage III b, will be
re-classified as NSTEMI. In one study, this re-classification increased the diagnosis
of MI by 47%.11 This re-classification is of prognostic importance because these
patients will now be treated more aggressively with GDT.12
cTn should always be interpreted in the clinical setting. Many cTn elevations,
especially below certain cut-off points and cTn elevations without a rise and fall, are
myocardial injuries and not MI (Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94).
A rise and/or fall in the cTn level is indicative of acute injury, while a persistently
elevated level is indicative of chronic injury10 (Table 2, page 38). Persistently elevated
cTn levels such as that present in those with pre-existing CAD, impaired renal
function, and persons older than 75 years appear predictive of a higher long-term
mortality.13
According to the 4th Universal definition, MI is diagnosed when there is a significant
rise and/or fall in cTn, with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL, and
accompanied with at least one of the following:10
 Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischemic origin of > 30 minutes.
 ECG changes of ischemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q
waves.
 Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality.

 Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
The exact value for the rise and fall is not addressed in most guidelines. The criteria
for determining a pathological rise between two serial cTn values are assay-dependent.10
The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry Guidelines and an expert consensus
committee have suggested that in patients with possible ACS and baseline (initial
result) cTn (or hs-cTn) results:10,14-16
 Markedly above > 99th percentile URL, changes in concentrations of >20% from
baseline should be used to define an MI.
 < 99th percentile URL and especially with hs-cTn assays, a change of 50-60% from
baseline has been suggested to overcome biological and analytical variations.
The assays used should have a coefficient of variation (CoV) of < 10% at the 99th
percentile URL.10,14-16 (Section 4.4, pages 51-54).
2.2.1.2 ECG in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Injury and Myocardial Infarction
In myocardial injury, the ECG is either normal or showing non-specific changes and
without the typical features of ischemia/infarction.
MI may be STEMI or NSTE-ACS based on the ECG. (Flowchart 3, page 37)
STEMI is diagnosed when there is:
 ST elevation of ≥ 1 mm in 2 contiguous leads including right precordial leads# or
 A new onset LBBB in the resting ECG
 In a patient with ischemic type chest pains of > 30 minutes and
 Accompanied by a rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers.
# In leads V2-V3 the cut-off point is ≥ 0.25 mV in males < 40 years, ≥ 0.2 mV in males ≥ 40 years and ≥ 0.15 mV
in females and in posterior chest leads V7-9 ≥ 0.05 mV and ≥ 0.1 mV in men < 40 years.10
In NSTE-ACS, ST elevation is absent on the resting ECG.
UA and NSTEMI differ from each other:
 In NSTEMI, the ischemia is severe enough to cause sufficient myocardial injury
to release detectable cardiac biomarkers. The diagnosis of NSTEMI is established
if a cardiac biomarker is detected. Often, there is a lapse of time from myocardial
injury before these biomarkers can be detected. As such, in the early stages, UA
and NSTEMI often cannot be differentiated.
 In NSTEMI, ST/T changes may be present in the ECG, whereas in UA they are
usually absent and even if they are present, are usually transient.

 MI may be STEMI or NSTE-ACS based on the ECG.
ACS is commonly due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, fissure or ulceration with
superimposed thrombosis and coronary vasospasm. Depending on the acuteness of
onset and the degree of occlusion and the presence of collaterals, patients can
present as NSTE-ACS or STEMI. In NSTE-ACS the thrombus is either non-occlusive
or there is complete thrombosis of a vessel that is well collateralized.
The majority (66%-78%) of ACS arise from lesions with <50% stenosis and less than
5% arise from lesions exhibiting >70% stenosis.17-20 From postmortem studies and in
vivo studies using intravascular ultrasound, four pathologic pathways to ACS have
been postulated:21
MI can be classified as 5 types depending on the pathology, clinical features,
prognosis and treatment strategies.10 (Table 6, page 41). This CPG focuses on
NSTE-ACS which is usually either:

less than 5% arise from lesions exhibiting >70% stenosis.
4.1 History
The symptoms of NSTE-ACS may be indistinguishable from that of STEMI. These
include:
 Chest pain
 This is the presenting symptom in most patients. Typical anginal chest pain
has traditionally been described as a central pain or pressure, aggravated by
emotional or physical stress and relieved by rest or GTN.
 Features that increase the probability of ischemic chest pain are pain
radiating to both arms, pain similar to prior ischemic episodes, a change in
the pattern of pain over the past 24 hours and associations with sweating22,23
and exertion.
 Features that reduced the probability that the chest pain is ischemic in origin
is variation with respiration or position, localisation to a point, pain reproduced
on palpation and described as sharp or stabbing.22-26
 The relief of symptoms after nitrate administration is not specific for angina
pain neither is relief with the “GI cocktail” indicative that it is non-cardiac.27,28

49
 Chest pain at rest carries a worse prognosis than symptoms elicited during
physical exertion. In patients with intermittent symptoms, an increasing number
of episodes preceding the index event also adversely affects prognosis.29
 Other symptoms
 8% of ACS patients did not present with chest pain.30 They were more likely
to be women, diabetics and the elderly.
 Atypical symptoms or angina equivalents included dyspnea (50%), unexplained
sweating (25%), nausea and vomiting (24%), syncope and presyncope (19%),
fatigue and epigastric discomfort.30
 Shoulder pain, sweating and a higher symptom distress score were more
likely to indicate an ischemic origin of the symptoms.22-24
In patients with these presentation(s) and with a prior history of coronary artery
disease (CAD) including prior abnormal stress test and peripheral arterial disease,
diabetes and other CVD risk factors and renal disease and a family history of premature
CVD, the index of suspicion of ACS should be high.22,31-33 Traditional cardiac risk
factors although not helpful for the confirmation or exclusion of ACS, help raise the
suspicion that symptoms may be ischemic in origin.34
There are cross-cultural and gender differences in symptoms reported by patients
with suspected ACS.35,36 Such differences are however not clinically relevant
because most of the symptoms display limited diagnostic value for ACS.35
"Atypical" symptoms cannot rule out ACS, while "typical" symptoms cannot rule it in.
Therefore, if a patient has symptoms that are compatible with ACS and an alternative
cause cannot be identified, clinicians must strongly consider the need for further
investigations.37
The diagnosis of ACS is more frequently missed in:38,39
 women
 those presenting with dyspnea
 in the presence of a normal ECG and
 in the presence of comorbidities
These patients had higher mortality than those who have received appropriate GDT
following a diagnosis of ACS.30,37-39
4.2 Physical Examination
The physical examination in ACS is generally unremarkable. The objective of the
physical examination is to identify:
 Possible etiologies such as aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, signs
of hypercholesterolemia (xanthomas, xanthalesmas).

NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(NSTE-ACS)

50
 Precipitating causes such as uncontrolled hypertension, anemia, thyrotoxicosis,
infection.
 Consequences of NSTE-ACS such as hypotension, heart failure and
arrhythmias.
 Other comorbid conditions such as lung disease, peripheral vascular
disease.
Presence of left ventricular failure (hypotension, respiratory crackles or S3
gallop) and arrhythmias carry a poor prognosis. Carotid bruits or peripheral
vascular disease indicates extensive atherosclerosis and a higher likelihood
of concomitant CAD.
In addition, the physical examination may help identify other causes for the
chest pain e.g., pericardial rub indicating pericarditis, tracheal shift and
unequal air entry indicating pneumothorax, low oxygen saturation and
unilateral swollen tender calf muscles suggesting pulmonary embolism, and
vesicles and scabs for herpes zoster.
4.3 Electrocardiography (ECG)
The ECG adds support to the diagnosis and provides prognostic information.40-45
A recording made during an episode of chest pain is particularly valuable.
Wherever possible, an ECG should be performed at the First Medical Contact
(FMC) as this increases the likelihood of recognising transient changes.46
It should be performed within 10 minutes of FMC.47
In a small prospective study, 12.5% of pre-hospital ECGs in patients who
were alert and experiencing chest pain or other symptoms consistent with
those caused by myocardial ischemia had clinically significant abnormalities
that were transient and not seen on the initial ECG done in the Emergency
Department. 46
All ambulances, government and private clinics should be equipped with
12-lead ECG-capable devices.
These should have computer-generated interpretations and wherever
possible, this should be reviewed by trained personnel. These computer-
generated ECG reports have a wide variation in the proportion false-positive
(0% to 42%) and false-negative (22% to 42%) results. Thus, it should not be
used as the sole means to diagnose ACS.48,49

ECG features that were associated with the highest 30-day incidence of
death or reinfarction in ACS patients were44:
 A combination of ST elevation (of at least 0.5 mm in at least 2 contiguous
leads) and ST depression (of at least 0.5 mm in 2 contiguous leads) - (12.4%)
 ST-segment depression of greater than 0.5 mm (alone or with concomitant
T-wave inversion - (10.5%)
 ST-segment elevation of at least 0.5 mm in at least 2 contiguous leads - (9.4%)
 Isolated T wave inversion (>1 mm in leads including the normalisation of
a known negative T-wave) - (5.5%).
Other possible ECG changes include flat T waves, T inversions in a non-dominant
R wave lead, presence of Q waves and poor R wave progression in the
anterior chest leads.
A new (or presumed new onset) LBBB and should be treated as STEMI.
A normal ECG does not exclude NSTE-ACS.49 Serial ECGs should be
performed as the changes may evolve.
We recommend all patients be provided a copy of their ECG for personal
keeping for comparison at future health encounters.
A missed diagnosis of ACS carries a worse prognosis.38,39
4.4. Cardiac Biomarkers
Cardiac troponins (cTn) T and I are the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for myocardial injury and necrosis.10,50
Where there is access to cTn testing, other biomarkers (AST, LDH, CK,
CKMB and myoglobin) are not useful for the initial diagnosis of acute MI.51
This is due to their lower sensitivity and specificity.52,53 CKMB may be used to
monitor for reinfarction.
In settings where cTns are not available, CKMB will be the alternate but less
preferred option.10,54
After acute MI, cTn becomes detectable at 6 hours using the conventional
older cTn assays and may remain elevated for up to 14 days. Hs-cTn assays
detect cTn release at an earlier time point than the older cTn tests leading to
an improved early sensitivity for a diagnosis of MI.15
cTn are markers of myocardial necrosis and not specific markers for MI. The

rise and/or fall of cTn with at least one value greater than the 99th percentile is
a key criterion in addition to other clinical features for the diagnosis of MI.10
(Section 2.2.1.1, pages 45-46)
The hs-cTn assay is currently replacing the conventional cTn assay in the
market. The term “high sensitivity (hs)” reflects the assay's characteristics
and not a different type of cTn. A “high sensitivity,” assay must meet 2
criteria:55
1. Have a coefficient of variation (CoV) or imprecision of less than or equal
to 10% at the 99th URL and
2. Have measurable concentrations below the 99th percentile that are
attainable with an assay at a concentration value above the assay’s limit
of detection for at least 50% (ideally >95%) of healthy individuals.
At present, most commercially available hs-cTn assays attain a CoV of < 10%
at the 99th URL indicating that the result is less affected by analytical noise
and exhibits lower inter-test variability.16 The true test of how well the % CoV
of assays will hold up is when assays are used daily in clinical practice and
each laboratory evaluates their assay performance regularly.16
Good preanalytical sampling is important as the hs-cTn assays are so
sensitive that poor sample quality, most commonly hemolysed specimen, can
be a problem.16
Hs-cTn measurement (using the 99th percentile threshold) was found to be
the most effective cardiac biomarker for diagnosing MI with an incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than the £20,000-30,000/QALY threshold
(ICER £7487-17,191/QALY).56
Using the lowest absolute concentrations which can be reliably detected,
Limit of Detection (LoD), absolute value of < 5ng/L has a 5-fold reduced
chance of missing an MI compared to using the 99th percentile cut-off.57 It,
however, increases by 3-fold the admission rate and unnecessary treatment
of patients who may not have an MI.58
Absolute changes in nanograms per litre using hs-cTn assays have better
diagnostic accuracy for MI than relative change values.59 This finding was
consistent in both the older patient and in those with impaired renal function. 59
The higher the cTn level, the higher is the likelihood of MI.59
Almost 13% of patients presenting with raised hs-cTn and chest pain eventually
prove not to have MI.60 This may reflect myocardial injuries and not MI. Many

primarily cardiac disorders as well as non-cardiac disorders with cardiac
involvement
may lead to myocardial injury and thereby hs-cTn
elevations.10,15,61,62 (Section 2, pages 44-47, Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II,
page 94)
A cTn elevation is not exclusive for ACS thus causing some problems in the
interpretation of the results. It may be present in 1% of a healthy reference
population.63 In a meta-analysis, about 47% of individuals had elevated cTn
after endurance training and using hs-cTn most marathon runners had
increased levels.64
In critically ill patients, the mechanisms of an elevated cTn is unclear and
there is no consensus on the appropriate approach and management. A
history of CAD with typical ischaemic ECG changes may indicate a Type I MI.
False positive cTn (no myocardial injury) results due to analytical issues are
very rare. These include cross reaction from other immuno-reactive proteins
and some neuromuscular diseases.15,61,62
All hospitals providing care for patients with acute chest pain or suspected MI
should have access to cTn, preferably hs-cTn (subtypes T or I) testing.10,50-53
Concentrations for hs-cTn assays should be expressed in nanograms per litre
instead of the commonly published units of micrograms per liter.15,16,55 The cut
off points differ among the different assays and the different generation
assays by the same vendor. Some assays have sex-specific values - females
tend to have lower hs-cTn levels.66,66 An ongoing prospective study however,
found that sex based cut- off values had little clinical impact on the diagnosis
of MI and that the uniform 99th percentile should remain the standard of care
when using hs-cTn T levels.67
Clinicians must be familiar with their local cTn assays-point of care (POC) kits
or lab based. In general,
 POC kits have lower analytical sensitivity and too wide CoV to detect cTn
at the 99th percentile URL.
 Use of POC kits in areas without access to central labs could potentially
reduce unnecessary referrals or transfers of cases and result in overall
cost savings. 57,68,69
 Almost all locally available laboratory-based assays can measure hs-cTn
at the 99th percentile URL.

It is important for each clinician to be familiar the 99th percentile URL and the
lower limit of detection (LoD) of the cTn assay used in their respective
hospitals.
It is inappropriate to label cTn results as positive and negative.15 Hs cTn can
be used to:
 Rule in MI - significant rise and/or fall of cTn with at least one value
greater than the 99th percentile URL in combination with other clinical
criteria. (Universal definition of MI).10
 Rule out MI (Section 5.1, pages 55 - 59)
Rule out does not equate to discharge. It requires consideration of other
causes of chest pain, early out-patient assessment for possible stable CAD or
optimisation of care in patients with known CAD.
Rule in strategies help commence appropriate GDT earlier for NSTE-ACS.
4.5 Other Diagnostic Modalities
These include:
 Echocardiography / Point of care ultrasound (POCUS):70-73
 Echocardiography is a safe modality that assists in the rapid diagnosis
and management of MI.
 It helps detect:
• LV systolic function - This is an important prognostic indicator.
• Transient reversible regional wall motion abnormalities which may
be present during ischemia.
• Complications of MI such as inter-ventricular shunts, papillary muscle
dysfunction and peri-myocardial effusion.
 Radiograph-Routine Chest Radiograph is not advised in all patients
presenting with chest pain suspicious of ACS. The decision should be
individualised.
I,C
Key Messages 5#:
 The combination of history, physical examination and ECG is important but
may be insufficient to reliably rule in or rule out NSTE-ACS.
 Cardiac troponins (cTn), preferably hs-cTn, both T and I are the most sensitive
and specific biomarkers for myocardial injury and necrosis.
 Elevations of cTn should be correlated with the clinical condition of the patient
and the ECG. (See definition of MI, Section 2, page 44-47 & Table 2, page 38)

Key Recommendations 1:
 An ECG should be performed within 10 minutes of the First Medical Contact
(FMC).
 All ambulances, government and private clinics should be equipped with
ECG-capable devices. These should have computer-generated interpretation
and wherever possible, reviewed by trained personnel.
Key Recommendations 2:
 All hospitals providing care for patients with acute chest pain or suspected MI
should have access to cTn (subtypes T or I) testing, preferably hs-cTn.
 Clinicians must be familiar with their local cTn assays-point of care (POC)
kits or laboratory based, the 99th percentile URL and the lower limit of detection
(LoD) of the assay used in their respective hospitals.
 The exact value of the cTn result should be stated and not as positive or
negative.
In patients presenting to the ED with chest pain, it is important:
 To timely recognize ACS. This will enable patients with ACS (including
those who are cardiac biomarker negative) to be treated rapidly and
appropriately and non-ACS patients to be rapidly discharged from a busy ED.
 To prognosticate ACS patients and help guide further management.
 A low-risk patient for ACS that is safe for discharge from ED is defined
as one who has a < 1% risk of MACE or death at ≥ 30-days follow up.74
 A high-risk patient with typical history of ischaemic pains and diagnostic
ECG changes, can be quickly triaged to the monitored area.
5.1 Risk Scores to “Rule out ACS”
The initial history, physical examination, and ECG alone are not always
reliable in predicting the presence of CAD and myocardial ischemia.76 Even in
patients presenting with acute chest pain, clinical evaluation alone did not
confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ACS.75-78
Cardiac biomarkers especially assays measuring hs-cTn are very sensitive
and can detect myocardial injury earlier than conventional older assays.
However, they are not specific and need to be interpreted in the clinical
context since there are other conditions besides MI that can give rise to raised
cTn.10,61,62,76 (Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94)

Based on the limitations of the diagnostic work-up, there will invariably be a
“missed diagnosis” of MI in the ED. The test threshold, the point of probability
at which the harms associated with elevated cTn testing and work-up exceed
the risks of untreated disease, has been estimated to be approximately 2%
for ED patients presenting with suspected cardiac chest pain.79 However, in a
survey, most ED physicians caring for patients with symptoms suggestive of
ACS, will only accept an arbitrary maximum of 1% for missed diagnosis for
MACE within 30 days of ED discharge.80
Patients presenting with chest pain or chest pain equivalents may, based on
the clinical history and ECG, have:
 Very low likelihood of NSTE-ACS or have an alternative cause for their
symptoms. These can be treated accordingly and be discharged from ED.
 Definite NSTE-ACS or STEMI. These patients should be admitted and
managed accordingly.
 Possible or suspected NSTE-ACS. These patients have normal or
non-diagnostic ECGs. They need to be evaluated using a “rule out
protocol” for ACS.
Evaluation is a continuous process and it is possible for a patient to move
from “very low likelihood” of ACS to definite NSTE-ACS as new information
becomes available or as the patient’s clinical condition changes.
5.1.1 “Rule out” ACS pathways (Flowchart 1, page 35)
Following a targeted clinical evaluation and an ECG, blood is taken for
measurement of cTn, preferably hs-cTn.
There are several algorithms based on cTn or hs-cTn to rule out “ACS”:
 HEART (History, ECG, Age, Risk Factor, Troponin) Pathway - the
HEART score and cTn < 99th percentile at 0 and 3 hours 81,82
 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 3-hour# Pathway83 -
 If onset of pain > 6 hours and baseline hs-cTn at presentation <99th
percentile.
 If symptom onset is < 6 hours, a repeat test at 3 hours is:
• Unchanged/no significant change (dependent on assay) and
• < 99th percentile and
• Patient is pain free and
• GRACE score < 140
 ESC 1-hour# Pathway83 - measures baseline and absolute changes in
hs-cTn levels within the first hour. The cutoff levels within the 0 h/1 h
algorithm are assay specific.
# The time of the blood test is time 0 and the time of the second blood test is either 1 hour or 3 hours
later.

The cut off levels for the different hs-cTn vary with the assays used. Some
have sex-specific cut-off points. It is important to check with the local vendor
the respective values.
These accelerated hs-cTn diagnostic “rule-out” protocols for patients with
suspected ACS using early serial troponin testing with either the 1h algorithm
or the 0 and 2 h algorithm are cost effective strategies with reduced ED-length
of stay, overall hospital savings and are safe. 84-92
The committee advocates Flowchart 1, page 35 using cTn, preferably hs-cTn,
as a rule-out pathway.
POC kits have a rapid turn-around time but are not sensitive.
When using POC kits93 :
 When the reading is elevated, admit the patient for further evaluation.
 If the reading is normal or non-detectable and the clinical suspicion is
high, repeat after 6 hours.
cTn have to be interpreted in the clinical context of the patient. 10,61,62,76 Other
key clinical data, such as the patient's chest pain features, past medical
history, and ECG have to be considered particularly when contemporary
hs-cTn assays are used10,14-16 (Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94).
Various clinical prediction risk scores have been developed to complement
the “rule out" cTn-based algorithms in patients who are suspected to have
ACS.
The common “rule out” risk scores are:
 HEART (History, ECG, Age, Risk Factor, Troponin) Score 81 (Appendix III,
page 95)
 TIMI risk score94 (Appendix IV, page 96)
 ADAPT-ADP95
 ASPECT96
 Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New
Zealand (HFA/CSANZ) rule97,98
The HEART score is the commonest risk score being used in our EDs
although there have been no validation studies in our local population.
Despite its use in different patient populations, the cTn type used and timeline
of follow-up, a low-risk HEART score had high sensitivity, negative predictive
value, and negative likelihood ratio for predicting short-term MACE. 99-103

Based on the HEART score, patients with suspected ACS can be stratified into:81
 ≥ 7: High risk - 72.7% risk of a major adverse event#
 4-6: Intermediate risk - 20.3% risk of a major adverse event#
 ≤ 3: Low risk - 2.5% risk of a major adverse event#
#Endpoints- MI, revascularization by PCI or CABG, death plus a combined endpoint of AMI, PCI, CABG
and death.
The modified HEART score uses hs-cTn rather than cTn.100
The TIMI score although commonly used, was not designed for application to
undifferentiated patients presenting with chest pain and suspected ACS. To
improve its performance as a “rule out” risk score, modifications have been
studied including using a cut off of 0 or 1 for low risk.75 In a prospective cohort
study, in conjunction with a single contemporary cTn assay taken at admission,
the HEART score outperformed the TIMI and GRACE scores in predicting
30-day MACE.103
We advocate measurement of clinical risk scores for ACS - the HEART score
(or modified HEART score if hs-cTn is used) or TIMI risk score 0-1 and the
“rule out” protocol in Flowchart 1, page 35.
About 2.1-3.3% of ACS patients are however, “missed” by the Heart
Score.77,78,91 Thus clinical judgement is still important before discharging the
patient from the ED. Persistent or recurrent symptoms during the ED stay
should prompt one to re-evaluate the patient.
It is important to remember that these are risk stratification strategies rather
than definitive diagnostic strategies. Further investigations may be necessary
to determine the cause of the chest pains. (e.g. stable coronary artery
disease or non-coronary cause of chest pain)
5.1.2 Patients in the “Indeterminate Group”- those who do not “rule in”
or “rule out” for ACS
The high sensitivity and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of hs-cTn
algorithms obviate the need for further testing to rule out MI.
The “rule out” and “rule in” ACS protocols will identify a middle group that
warrants further observation and/or investigation. This includes patients with:
 Ongoing/recurrent chest symptoms without significant ECG or cTn
elevations. In these patients, alternative causes for the chest symptoms
should be excluded.

 Elevated cTn /hs-cTn levels but without a significant rise and fall. These
patients are typically elderly patients with pre-existing CAD and high
long-term mortality.13
 Mildly raised cTn levels, equivocal results and patients who cannot be
confidently ruled out or ruled in for MI.
 UA with a negative cTn /hs-cTn.
These patients need to be properly evaluated and given appropriate treatment
and at the same time avoiding unnecessary admissions, pharmacological
therapy or invasive procedures.
Depending on the available facilities and the clinical status of the patient, they
may be (in accordance with Flowchart 1, page 35):
 Admitted
 Observed in the observational area of the ED
 Referred for an early cardiology (or in the absence of cardiology, internal
medicine) out-patient consult.
Other diagnostic modalities in these patients include:104
 Repeating ECG to look for serial changes in patients with ongoing chest
pain.
 Echocardiography/POCUS to look for new wall motion abnormalities.
 Functional stress testing with or without imaging -
 Exercise/ pharmacological stress testing
• Stratifies these intermediate risk patients to a near zero short-term
risk of ACS.
 Coronary angiography - non-invasive computer tomography coronary
angiography (CTCA) or conventional (invasive) coronary angiography.
A systematic review in 2017 found CTCA if available, appropriate in all
settings of acute chest pain suspicious of ACS.105
For the non-invasive investigation of these low risk patients, please refer to
Flowchart 2, page 36 and the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines on Management of Stable Coronary Artery Disease, 2018, 2nd Ed.7
These patients should be advised on lifestyle modification (dietary changes,
regular exercise, smoking cessation). If the likelihood of underlying CAD is
high, they should be started on antiplatelet agents, high intensity statins and
appropriate anti-ischemic therapy (Section 7.3, pages 69-76).

5.2 Risk scores for Prognostication in NSTE-ACS
Patients with NSTE-ACS have an increased risk of death, recurrent MI,
recurrent symptomatic ischemia, serious arrhythmias, heart failure and
stroke.
Early assessment would help in determining the:
 Prognosis of the patient
 Management strategies
 Selection of the site of care (coronary care unit, monitored step-down
ward or outpatient setting)
 Selection of appropriate therapy and the need for coronary angiogram
and revascularization
Risk is highest at the time of presentation but remains elevated past the acute
phase. By 6 months NSTE-ACS mortality rates may equal or exceed those of
STEMI.44
There are many ways of risk stratifying these patients with NSTE-ACS:
 Clinical features as in Table 3
 Risk scores such as;
 HEART (History, ECG, Age, Risk Factor, Troponin) Score (Appendix III):
• Predicts 30-day MACE.81,106
 TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score (Appendix IV):
• Predicts 14-day outcomes.94
 GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) Risk Score
(Appendix V):
• Predicts in-hospital and 6-month death or recurrent MI.107
We advocate TIMI or GRACE risk scoring in these patients with definite
NSTE-ACS.94,107
This highlights the importance of clinical parameters in assessing prognosis.
These validated risk scores reﬁne risk stratiﬁcation, thereby improving patient
care in routine clinical practice.
These risk scores help dictate the appropriate strategy (invasive versus
ischaemic- guided) and the timing of the strategy (early versus late invasive)
in patients with NSTE-ACS.108
The very-high-risk and high-risk patients should be considered for transfer to
a PCI-capable centre as soon as possible (Table 3, page 39).

5.3 Risk Scores for Bleeding
Hemorrhagic complications are an independent risk factor for subsequent
mortality in ACS patients and in those undergoing PCI. In patients at low risk,
it is important to weigh the benefits of PCI versus the bleeding risk of the
procedure and subsequent need for dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT).
Patients at high bleeding risk may be considered for newer generation stents
and shorter duration of DAPT.
These patients can be identified by the following risk scores:
 ACUITY HORIZONS-AMI Bleeding Risk Score - identifies patients at
increased risk for non-CABG-related bleeding and subsequent 1-year
mortality109
 CRUSADE Bleeding Risk Score -predicts in-hospital major bleeding110
 BleeMACS score- predicts 1-year post discharge bleeding111
 TRILOGY-ACS- a tool to predict risk of bleeding on DAPT.112
 PRECISE-DAPT (PREdicting bleeding Complications In patients
undergoing Stent implantation and subsEquent Dual Anti Platelet Therapy)
- tool for the prediction of out-of-hospital bleeding during DAPT. 113,114
We advocate using the PRECISE-DAPT risk score in patients at high risk of
bleeding.113 ,114(Appendix VI, page 98)
These scores are calculated based on age, clinical status and hemodynamics
at presentation, serum creatinine and haematocrit level and the use and
combinations of antiplatelets and anticoagulants.

managed as for STEMI or as for NSTE-ACS.
 Possible or suspected NSTE-ACS. These patients have normal or non-di
agnostic ECGs. They need to be evaluated using a “rule out protocol” for
ACS. (Flowchart 1, page 35)

 Patients with chest pain suspected to be due to ACS should have their cTn,
preferably hs-cTn, measured.
 Patients with suspected ACS should be risk stratified using the HEART
or TIMI risk scores and the “Rule out ACS” Flowchart 1, page 35
 Using the “Rule out ACS” Flowchart 1, patients may be:
 Discharged from ED
 Referred for an early outpatient cardiology (or in the absence of cardiology,
internal medicine) consult
 Admitted for definitive management of NSTE-ACS.
Key Recommendations 4:
 Patients with definite NSTE-ACS should be risk stratified using clinical
features (Table 3, page 39), TIMI or GRACE risk scores (Appendix IV & V,
pages 96-97). This will help determine:
 Prognosis of the patient
 Management strategies
 Selection of the site of care (coronary care unit, monitored step-down ward
or outpatient setting)
 Selection of appropriate therapy and the need for coronary angiogram and
revascularization
 Patients with high bleeding risk should be assessed using the PRECISE
DAPT bleeding score (Appendix VI, page 98).
6.1 For the General Public
Public awareness about heart disease should be increased so that individuals
will seek appropriate treatment early, thus reducing time from symptom onset
to FMC.
The public should be educated about:
 Symptoms of ACS.
 The importance of seeking early treatment at the nearest clinic or hospital.
Reducing the time delay from onset of symptoms to First Medical Contact
(FMC) remains challenging. From the time of onset of chest pain to presentation
at the Emergency Unit, time delays can vary from a median of 2.1 hours in
Singapore, 2.4 hours in New Zealand to 8.3 hours in Japan.115-118

NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(NSTE-ACS)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

63
Contributary causes include older age, female sex, presence of diabetes
mellitus, patients attributing symptoms to noncardiac causes and awaiting
symptom resolution, lack of health insurance coverage and poor access to
transportation.115-118
A meta-analysis indicated that only around half of the studied interventions
report any success in reducing prehospital delay.119 It is unclear what differentiates
effective from non-effective interventions to reduce prehospital delays.119 The
Behaviour Changing Techniques (BCT) most commonly identified within
interventions were: 119
 Action planning
 Information about health consequences
 Problem-solving
 Information on signs and symptoms and instruction on what to do
It was, however, not possible to establish which particular BCT was more
effective.119
Immediate measures to be taken by the individual in suspected cases of
ACS:
 Seek immediate medical attention at the nearest clinic or hospital.
 Call for an ambulance (dial 999) or get someone to take you immediately.
 Do not drive yourself.
 If not on regular aspirin and with no history of allergy, chew 300mg aspirin
immediately. Soluble and chewable aspirin formulations are preferable
to solid aspirin either chewed or swallowed.120,121 Regular aspirin is
preferred over enteric coated aspirin in this situation because of its faster
onset of action.122
 Although all Guidelines advise the use of aspirin as soon as possible
after the onset of symptoms, there is a lack of randomised trial data and
a risk of misdiagnosis. In a small retrospective study, patients receiving
aspirin before admission were less likely to present with NSTE-ACS.123
 For patients with known CHD, history of previous PCI and/or CABG, take
one dose of GTN either as a sublingual tablet or spray and 300mg of
chewable aspirin (if not taken earlier).
 If the patient is already on aspirin 75-150mg, it is advisable to take an
additional 300mg of aspirin.
 The 999 dispatchers will provide additional care instructions before the
arrival of the pre-hospital care (PHC) providers.

6.2 Primary Care Clinics
Chest pain is one of the more common presentations in primary care facilities.
In less urban areas, it may be the most accessible healthcare facility to the
patient.
Management will begin with assessment of the patient by:
 Taking history and physical examination. It is important to look for
haemodynamic instability. (Sections 4.1 & 4.2, pages 48-50)
 Performing an ECG - This is an essential investigation and should be made
routinely available in all primary care settings. A patient with a
non-interpretable ECG may have NSTE-ACS. Also, a normal ECG does
not exclude NSTE-ACS. (Section 4.3, pages 50-51)
 Measuring cardiac biomarkers (cTn) - Presently, this is usually done at the
hospital level where definitive treatment can also be given.
In suspected NSTE-ACS:
 If the primary care facility does not have ambulance facilities, call 999 to
assist in patient transfer to hospital.
 Ask patient to chew and swallow aspirin 300mg (non-enteric coated) if not
already done so.124,125
 Serve sublingual GTN, if SBP is more than 90mmHg and patient has
recurrent or ongoing chest pains.
 Administer oxygen therapy via face mask or nasal prongs if patient is
dyspnoeic and/or SpO2 is < 95%.
 Set up IV access, if possible.
 Administer IV morphine as indicated.
 Inform the hospital prior to transfer.
6.3 Medical Emergency Coordination Centre (MECC) and Ambulance
Responders
When a patient presents with chest pain, it is of paramount importance to
determine if:
 The pain is cardiac in origin.
 If cardiac in origin, is it due to:
 STEMI - requires immediate treatment to reopen the occluded infarct
related artery preferably by Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
(PCI) if this can be done in a timely manner.8
 NSTE-ACS - UA or NSTEMI. The initial management is medical.

When there is a 999 call, the caller is first directed to Telekoms who will verify
the authenticity of the caller. It is then directed to a Medical Emergency
Coordination Centre (MECC), who will then:
A. Identify the chief complaint
 If the complaint is chest pain or a chest pain equivalent (eg chest
heaviness, discomfort which may be associated with sweating and/or
shortness of breath), a validated protocol will be used addressing:
 Nature of complaint and severity including level of alertness.
 Difficulty breathing.
 Changing of skin colour (pallor / blue).
 Previous history of heart attack or angina.
 Use of medications in the past 12 hours.
 Pre-arrival instructions will be given and this includes immediate self-care
or bystander care while waiting for ambulance arrival.
 Ambulance teams dispatched to the scene should be trained and equipped
to perform an ECG (with the use of Advanced Cardiac Care Device which
is capable of ECG recording, transmission, and real-time ECG monitoring
and telemetry).
 If the ECG (after interpretation by trained personnel) shows features of
STEMI, the patient should be transported to the nearest hospital preferably
with PCI-capable services.8 Please refer to the 2019 Malaysian Clinical
Practice Guidelines on Management of ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction.8
 If the patient with NSTE-ACS has ongoing/ recurrent chest pain, they too
should be considered for immediate transfer to a PCI-capable hospital.
 High-risk unstable patients should be taken to the nearest hospital for
stabilization first.
 Supportive care should be provided:
 Monitor the patient’s hemodynamics continuously prior to and during
transfer including continuous ECG monitoring.
 Give 300mg of chewable aspirin (if not taken earlier.)124,125
 GTN either as a sublingual tablet or spray if there are no contraindications.
Pre-hospital care personnel should be trained to:
 Identify patients at high risk of developing ACS such as those with prior
heart disease, the elderly, presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors -
diabetes, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a family history of
premature heart disease.
 Interpret the ECG, identify and treat common arrhythmias. There should
be periodic feedback reports and other quality improvement measures in
the interpretation of ECGs.126
Key Recommendations 5:
 Public awareness about heart disease should be increased so that individuals
will seek appropriate treatment early, thus reducing time from symptom onset
to FMC.
 If the person is suspected to have an ACS and is not on regular aspirin with
no history of allergy, 300mg aspirin should be administered. Soluble and
chewable aspirin formulations are preferable to solid aspirin either chewed or
swallowed.
Key Recommendations 6:
 Ambulance responders should be trained and equipped to perform an ECG.
 If the ECG shows STEMI or the patient with NSTE-ACS has ongoing/
recurrent chest pain, they should be considered for immediate transfer to a
PCI-capable hospital. High-risk unstable patients should be taken to the
nearest hospital for stabilization first.

 Identify patients with NSTE-ACS and STEMI based on history and
characteristic ECG changes after consultation with the ED physician/
medical officer
 Assess, stabilise and monitor the patient’s hemodynamics continuously
prior to and during transfer
7.1 Emergency Department
When the patient with suspected ACS reaches the emergency department,
evaluation and initial management should be prompt. Patients can be either
triaged to the red or yellow zone according to the Malaysian Triage Scale.
A quick targeted history should be taken, and vital signs noted.
 A 12 lead ECG should be taken within 10 minutes of the patient’s arrival
in the emergency department.127,128 This should be compared with prehospital
ECGs or that taken earlier if available.
Based on the initial clinical evaluation, the patient may have:
 Definite STEMI
 NSTE-ACS with ongoing chest pain. If the initial ECG does not show ST
elevation but the patient is suspected of having a STEMI in view of the
prolonged ischaemic-type chest pain of > 30 minutes and recurrent/on
going chest pains, the following steps may be taken:
7. IN - HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT OF

(NSTE-ACS)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
3RD EDITION

67
 Repeating the ECG at 15-minute intervals to detect evolving changes
of ischemia/infarction.
 The use of additional chest leads may be helpful in detecting STEMI at
uncommon and difficult to detect sites:
• Additional posterior chest wall leads (V7-V9) can detect a posterior
MI (circumflex occlusion).10,129-132
• Right precordial leads (V3R and V4R) may be necessary to identify
concomitant Right Ventricular (RV) infarction in the presence of an
inferior wall MI.10,133
 If STEMI has been excluded, the patient may fall into 3 categories as
outlined in Section 5.1:
 Very low likelihood to be ACS or have an alternative cause for their
symptoms. These can be treated accordingly and be considered for
discharge.
 Definite NSTE-ACS
 Possible or suspected NSTE-ACS - In these individuals the HEART
Score (or modified HEART score) or TIMI score should be calculated,
the cTn, preferably hs-cTn measured and the “rule out protocol”
Flowchart 1, page 35 be used.
In patients with NSTE-ACS, the following should be done:
 Venous access established and blood taken for measurement of cardiac
biomarkers (cTn-preferably hs cTn).
 The following are instituted:
 Aspirin (300mg) if not taken prior to arrival.124,125
 Oxygen is administered in patients with hypoxemia.134-137
• SpO2 ≤ 90%
• SpO2 > 90 - ≤ 95%
 In the presence of ongoing chest pain, GTN sublingual tablet (0.3- 0.6 mg)
or spray (0.4-0.8 mg) should be administered every 5 minutes for up to
three doses if no contraindications exists (such as hypotension).
Nitrates only help with symptom relief.
 If symptoms are unrelieved:
• Serial ECGs should be taken every 10-15minutes until the patient is
pain free and compared with pre-existing ECGs to look for changes
of STEMI.
• Assess the need for i.v. GTN and/or
• i.v. morphine at 2-5 mg by slow bolus injection every 5-15 minutes as
necessary. Watch for adverse events - hypotension and respiratory
depression. Antiemetic (i.v. metoclopramide 10 mg or promethazine
25mg) should be given with morphine and 8-hourly as necessary.
Morphine should be used cautiously.138 i.v. fentanyl 50mcg in titrated
doses may also be considered.

 s.c. LMWH or s.c. fondaparinux should be given.139-143
 In the presence of ongoing chest pains and/or hemodynamic instability,
urgent coronary angiography with view to revascularization should be
considered if facilities are available.107,144-150
In patients with chest pain not due to ACS, other important clinical conditions
should also be considered. Some of these can be life threatening.
Non-ischemic cardiovascular causes of chest pain
 Aortic dissection
 Pulmonary embolism
 Pericarditis and myocarditis
Non-cardiovascular causes of chest pain
 Gastrointestinal causes (e.g. gastro-esophageal reflux, oesophageal
spasm, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, biliary disease)
 Musculoskeletal causes (e.g. costochondritis, cervical radiculopathy,
fibrositis)
 Pulmonary (e.g. pneumonia, pleuritis, pneumothorax)
 Other etiologies (e.g. herpes zoster, panic attack)
I,A
I,B
Key Recommendations 7:
 Patients with NSTE-ACS should be given:
 Aspirin 300 mg stat (if not given earlier)
 And Oxygen if oxygen saturation < 95%
 And GTN for ongoing or recurrent chest pains
 And i.v. morphine with i.v. anti-emetics or fentanyl for ongoing chest pains
 And s.c. low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux
 In the presence of ongoing chest pains and/or hemodynamic instability, urgent
coronary angiography with view to revascularization should be considered.
 In patients with recurrent/ ongoing chest pain not due to ACS, other important
clinical conditions should also be considered.
7.2 Level of Care
Following risk stratification as outlined in section 5.2, page 60 the patient may
be admitted to:
 Coronary care unit (CCU) - Very high risk and High-risk individuals
 High dependency Unit - Moderate risk individuals
 General ward - Low risk individuals
Stable, low-risk NSTE-ACS may be managed appropriately on telemetry
wards and result in a reduction in hospital costs and critical care capacity.151

7.3. Pharmacotherapy
In NSTE-ACS the commonest pathophysiology (Type 1 MI) is a ruptured or
fissured plaque with superadded thrombosis leading to varying degrees of
occlusion of the vessel. Thus, anti-thrombotic therapy (both antiplatelet and
anticoagulant) plays a more important role in management than anti-ischemic
agents.
In Type 2 MI, the underlying etiology needs to be addressed. Anti-ischemic
agents play a more important role than antiplatelets and antithrombotic
agents.
7.3.1 Antiplatelet therapy
7.3.1.1 Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA/Aspirin)
 Recommended loading dose: 300mg. This should be chewed or
crushed.124,125 Enteric-coated aspirin is not recommended as an initial
loading dose because of its slow onset of action.
 Maintenance dose: 75-100mg daily lifelong regardless of treatment
strategy.152-154
 An aspirin dose of 300-325mg daily is associated with an increased risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding without greater efficacy.153,154 This was seen
when aspirin was used alone and in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor
such a clopidogrel.155
 For patients taking ticagrelor, the aspirin maintenance dose should be
≤100mg daily.156,157
 Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in combination with DAPT should be
considered for patients who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeds
(i.e. history of gastrointestinal ulcer/haemorrhage, anticoagulant therapy,
chronic NSAID/corticosteroid use or two or more of the following:
age ≥65 years, dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease,
Helicobacter pylori infection, chronic alcohol use)158,159
 In those patients allergic to aspirin, the available options include:
 More potent P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor or prasugrel) alone
 Cilostazol with clopidogrel 160
 Triflusal with clopidogrel 161,162
 Aspirin desensitisation 163,164

7.3.1.2 P2Y12 inhibitors (Appendix VII, page 99)
These may be given as:
 A substitute to patients who are intolerant or allergic to aspirin.
 As part of DAPT
The different P2Y12 inhibitors each have their own special characteristics
that may prompt one being favoured over another in various circumstances.
Recognising the characteristic differences in the agents can help with the
choice of the best agent for individual patients. (Appendix VII, page 99)
Both ticagrelor and prasugrel have similar efficacy and bleeding rates when
used as part of DAPT at 7 days, 1 month and 1 year.165-168 A recent study
found prasugrel to be superior to ticagrelor in reduction of death, MI or stroke
without an increase in major bleeding.169
7.3.1.2.1 Clopidogrel
 Loading dose: 300 to 600mg, maintenance dose: 75mg daily.152,170
 The benefits of long term clopidogrel when added to aspirin was seen in
NSTE-ACS patients treated medically, those undergoing PCI or coronary
artery bypass grafting.152,171,172
 Clopidogrel versus prasugrel. In ACS patients:
 undergoing PCI, prasugrel significantly reduced MACE but there was
an increase in severe bleeding complications when compared to
clopidogrel.173
 who are medically managed, MACE and severe bleeding rates were
similar between prasugrel and clopidogrel groups.174
 Clopidogrel versus ticagrelor. In ACS patients:
 with or without PCI, ticagrelor significantly reduced MACE compared
to clopidogrel and severe bleeding rates were similar.156
 The use of clopidogrel for up to a year as part of a strategy of DAPT was
found to be cost effective.175
7.3.1.2.2 Prasugrel
 Prasugrel may be considered as a second antiplatelet agent after the
coronary angiogram has been performed. (No pre-treatment)
 Loading dose: 60mg, maintenance dose: 10mg/day.173,176
 It is not recommended due to a higher risk of major bleeding in patients
who are:173,176
 > 75 years old or,
 < 60kg weight or,
 have prior history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
 It should be considered in patients who present with stent thrombosis
despite compliance with clopidogrel therapy.177

7.3.1.2.3 Ticagrelor
 Loading dose: 180mg, maintenance dose: 90mg twice daily.156,178
 When compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor resulted in a significant reduction
in cardiac end points in patients undergoing an early invasive or medically
treated strategy.156,178
 Potential drawback is dyspnoea and transient ventricular pauses during
the first week. This was rarely associated with symptoms or need for a
pacemaker. Caution should be exercised in patients with heart block.
7.3.1.3 Timing of Initiation of DAPT
 When given as part of DAPT, the timing of initiation of the second
antiplatelet agent is not clear. There are a few randomised trials directly
comparing pre-treatment with initiation at the time of angiography.179
 Unlike in STEMI, NSTE-ACS patients are a heterogenous group and
include patients with multivessel disease who may be more suitable for
coronary artery bypass surgery or maybe even have normal coronaries.
 Although most Guidelines advocate pre-treatment, no recommendation
for or against pre-treatment with these agents can be formulated because
of the lack of trial data.
 The exact timing is left to the clinical judgement of the attending physician.
7.3.1.4 Duration of DAPT
 In NSTE-ACS patients, with or without PCI, DAPT is recommended for
up to 12 months unless there are contraindications such as excessive
risk of bleeds.152,171,180-182
 In ACS patients who underwent PCI and at high risk of bleeding, DAPT
maybe continued for 3 to 6 months.181,182
 Continuing DAPT for more than 12 months significantly reduces MACE
at the expense of an increase in major bleeding. 183,184
7.3.1.5 Switching a potent P2Y12 to clopidogrel
 In patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI, ticagrelor or prasugrel is
usually preferred to clopidogrel.
 However, many patients may need to be switched to clopidogrel due to
an increased risk of bleeding, other side effects (eg dyspnoea with
ticagrelor) and costs. 165,185-188
 The following approaches maybe considered:165,185-188
 Those on ticagrelor:
• De-escalate to clopidogrel with a loading dose of 300-600mg followed
by 75mg daily, to be initiated at the time of the next scheduled
ticagrelor dose.

 Those on prasugrel:185
• De-escalate directly to clopidogrel 75mg (without a loading dose) at
the time of the next scheduled prasugrel dose.
7.3.1.6 Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa Inhibitors (Appendix VIII, page 100)
 These agents are no longer used pre-procedure/ “upstream” because
studies have not found this practice to be superior to the provisional
selective use after angiography. It is also associated with an increased
risk of bleeding.189,190
 Their main use is in patients who have been found to have a large
thrombus burden at the time of coronary angiography.
 These agents include:
 Abciximab
 Tirofiban
 Eptifibatide
7.3.2 Anticoagulant Therapy (Appendix IX, page 101)
 In NSTE-ACS patients managed medically, parenteral anticoagulation is
recommended as soon as possible after the diagnosis.139,140,191
 The type of agent used may vary depending on whether the patient is
managed by an early invasive or a conservative approach, issues of cost
and local practice.
 The duration of anticoagulant therapy in patients treated medically would
vary between 2-8 days.
7.3.2.1 Heparin
This includes:
 Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
 For high risk NSTE-ACS patients undergoing an early invasive approach,
UFH had similar efficacy to enoxaparin.192,193
 Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) - Enoxaparin
 It is best used in NSTE-ACS patients treated conservatively.141,194,195
 In patients > 75 years of age and with renal impairment (serum creatinine
(Scr) > 200 µmol/L in women and > 250 µmol/L in men), UFH is preferable
to LMWH.196

7.3.2.2 Anti-Xa inhibitors
This includes:
 Fondaparinux 142,143
 It is best used in NSTE-ACS patients treated conservatively.
 It is associated with an increase in catheter-related thrombus and
coronary angiographic complications. Thus, it is not recommended as
the sole anticoagulant during PCI.
 If used in patients with NSTE-ACS and the patient requires an invasive
strategy, UFH should be given during the procedure.
 In patients with NSTE-ACS, fondaparinux was found to be more cost
effective and associated with less short and midterm bleeding events
compared with enoxaparin.197-199
Presently newer oral anti-Xa inhibitors are undergoing evaluation for ACS. A
meta-analysis showed that the addition of Direct Oral Ant-Coagulants
(DOAC) to DAPT in patients with NSTE-ACS did not show any significant
treatment effect at the risk of increased bleeding.200
7.3.3 Anti-ischemic Drug Therapy
These agents may be given either for relief of ischemia (symptoms) or for
improvement of prognosis.
7.3.3.1 β-blockers (Appendix X, page 102)
 There is limited randomised trials addressing the efficacy of β-blockers
in NSTE-ACS.201,202
 β-blockers should be given to patients with heart failure and/or LV
dysfunction (LVEF < 40%), continuing angina and/ or ischemia.203-207
 There is limited evidence to administer it routinely in all patients.208-211
 In the absence of contraindications, β-blockers may be administered
after the patient has been stabilized and prior to hospital discharge.202
 Relative contraindications for β-blockers include:
 Patients with marked first-degree AV block (PR interval > 0.24s).
 Second - or third-degree AV block.
 History of bronchial asthma
 Severe peripheral arterial disease
 Acute decompensated LV dysfunction
 Cardiogenic shock.
 For patients who have LVEF <40% and those who subsequently develop
left ventricular systolic dysfunction consider bisoprolol, carvedilol, long
acting metoprolol or nebivolol.203-207
 A lower starting dose of 1.25mg daily for bisoprolol/nebivolol or carvedilol
3.125mg twice daily should be initiated. This should be slowly up-titrated
till the target dose or the maximally tolerated dose is achieved.

7.3.3.2 Inhibitors of the Renin Angiotensin System-Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) / Renin Angiotension Receptor
Blockers (ARB) (Appendix XI, page 103)
 Once clinically and haemodynamically stable, ACEI may be initiated and
continued for life in all patients with LVEF <40% and in those with
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or CKD, unless contraindicated.212,213
 For those who are ACEI intolerant, ARBs are recommended in patients
with HF and/or LVEF <40%. 214-216
7.3.3.3 Lipid Modifying Drugs
 High dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 40-80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40mg
daily) should be initiated as soon as possible after the diagnosis of
ACS.217-225
 It is safe and has been shown to improve outcomes regardless of baseline
LDL-C levels. 217,218,224-226
 For patients who are already taking low or moderate-intensity statins,
statin therapy should be intensified.217
 Target LDL-C should be < 1.8mmol/L (preferably < 1.4mmol/L) or a
reduction of at least 50% from the baseline, the lower the better. 217,227-235
 In patients whose LDL-C ≥ 1.8mmol/L despite maximally tolerated therapy,
the addition of non-statin therapy (ezetimibe and PCSK-9 Inhibitors)
should be considered.232-235
 Patients with LDL-C > 2.6 months on maximally tolerated statins following
an ACS and had a greater benefit with further lowering of the LDL-C with
the addition of PCSK-9 inhibitors.234
 Refer to 2017 Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines on Dyslipidemia,
4th Ed.217
7.3.3.4 Nitrates (Appendix XII, page 104)
 Nitrates help with symptom relief only. They should be used cautiously in
the presence of a low BP.
 Intravenous nitrates may be administered in the following situations:
 No symptom relief after 3 doses of sublingual GTN
 Presence of dynamic ECG changes
 Presence of left ventricular failure
 Concomitant high blood pressure.
 Patients who require intravenous GTN for more than 24 hours may need
periodic increases in the infusion rate and use of nontolerance-producing
regimens (e.g., intermittent dosing) to maintain efficacy.236
 Oral or topical nitrates can be used as alternatives to intravenous GTN
for patients who do not have refractory or recurrent ischemia.

 Oral nitrates may be given after 12 to 24 hours of pain free period.
Rebound angina may occur with abrupt cessation of nitrates.237
 Contraindications to nitrate therapy:
 Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg)
 RV infarction
 History of ingestion of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in the preceding
24 to 48 hours (depending upon the half-life of the agent).238-240
7.3.3.5 Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) (Appendix XIII, page 105)
CCBs may be used in the following situations:
 A non-dihydropyridine CCB (e.g. verapamil or diltiazem) may be used as
an alternative to β-blockers in patients who are not able to tolerate or
who have contraindications.241-243
 Verapamil, diltiazem, slow release nifedipine or amlodipine can be
administered in patients with continuing or recurring angina despite
adequate doses of nitrates and β-blockers.241-243
 Prinzmetal’s angina (variant angina)
 Long-acting CCBs and nitrates maybe used for patients with coronary
artery spasm.
 Immediate-release nifedipine is contraindicated. 244,245
7.3.3.6 Other Anti-ischemic agents
These include:
 Ivabradine
 Ivabradine has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce cardiovascular
hospitalisation, fatal and non-fatal MI and the need for coronary
revascularization in patients with stable CAD, moderate LV dysfunction
and HR >70 bpm.246-251
 Ivabradine may be considered for symptomatic treatment of stable
CAD in patients with normal sinus rhythm, especially in those who
have a contraindication to or intolerance to β-blockers and if the
resting HR is above 70/min.246-248
 Ranolazine
 Compared to placebo, or as additional to current anti-anginal therapy,
ranolazine improved angina symptoms, exercise tolerance, and
decreased angina attacks and GTN consumption.252-258
 Trimetazidine
 In small clinical studies, trimetazidine has been shown to be effective
in providing angina symptom relief, reduction in the need for nitrates,
time to onset of ST depression and improving functional capacity.259-261
It is useful as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-ischaemic
agents.259-261

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

Key Recommendations 8:
 Patients with NSTE-ACS should be on DAPT.
 Aspirin should be given at the time of diagnosis.
 The timing of the second antiplatelet agent will depend on the agent used.
No firm recommendations can be made about pre-treatment.
• Clopidogrel and ticagrelor, in general, can be administered early
• Prasugrel should be given after the coronary angiogram before proceeding
to PCI.
 Duration of DAPT will depend on the risk of bleeding versus the thrombotic
risk. Ideally all patients should be given for 1 year but patients with high
bleeding risk can be given DAPT for a shorter period of 3-6 months.
 Patients with NSTE-ACS treated medically (without an invasive strategy) should
be on s.c. LMWH or s.c. fondaparinux for 2-8 days or until hospital discharge.
Key Recommendations 9:
 High dose statins should be initiated soon after diagnosis.
 In patients who have angina/ischemia, β-blockers and/or non-dihydropyridine
CCBs should be prescribed as first-line treatment to reduce angina because
it is widely available.
 Long-acting nitrates, trimetazidime and ranolazine are recommended as
add-on therapy in patients who remain symptomatic. Ivabradine may also be
considered for in patients with normal sinus rhythm, especially in those who
have a contraindication to or intolerance to β-blockers and if the resting HR is
above 70/min.
7.4 Revascularization Strategies
There is a strong rationale for early revascularization in patients with
NSTE-ACS who are at intermediate/high risk and very high risk for MACE
post NSTE-ACS. (section 5.2. page 60)
Contemporary pharmacotherapy (availability of more potent antiplatelet
agents, the use of high intensity statin), percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI) techniques and newer devices have reduced the hazards of the
procedure especially among experienced operators performing these in
high-risk patients during the index hospital admission.
The decision for coronary angiography with view to revascularization should
be weighed against the benefits and harm of the procedure, patient preferences,
ischaemic and bleeding risks, and the impact of other major co-morbidities.

I,B
The indication for coronary angiography and the timing for myocardial
revascularization depends on:
 Clinical presentation
 Risk scores (as outlined in section 5.2, page 60)
 Comorbidities
 Presence of high-risk features
 Frailty
 Cognitive status
 Estimated life expectancy
 Functional and anatomic severity of the underlying CAD
Potential benefits of early coronary angiography and revascularization are:
 Diagnostic accuracy
 Better risk stratification
 Faster symptom relief
 Improved short and long-term prognosis and quality of life
 Shortened duration of hospitalisation
Patients with features indicating that they are very high risk/high risk and
presenting to non-PCI capable centres should be considered for immediate
transfer to a PCI capable centre after initial stabilization.108
7.4.1 Routine early invasive management 144-148
The rationale for this strategy is to:
 Confirm the diagnosis and identify the culprit lesion
 Rapidly risk stratify patients by assessing their coronary anatomy
 Allow for earlier revascularization and preventing MACE
 Facilitate early discharge
It has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, reduce recurrent ACS
events, subsequent rehospitalisation and revascularization.149,262-265 However,
no reduction in mortality has been observed.
Thus, an early invasive strategy in high-risk NSTE-ACS patients predominantly
reduces recurrent ischemia (rather than the hard outcomes of recurrent MI or
death). This strategy reduces length of stay and cost but it creates a logistical
burden on cardiac catheterisation labs, especially during weekends.108 Also,
the cost-effectiveness of this approach in those with substantial co-morbidities
or in the setting of rural or remote patients has not been studied.

7.4.2 Urgent vs early invasive management
 Urgent invasive strategy - (Immediate, as soon as possible)
 Ideally the management should be similar to STEMI in terms of the
rapidness to revascularization.
 Patients with very high risk NSTE-ACS have a poor short and long-term
prognosis if left untreated.149,150
 Early invasive strategy (within 24 h of hospital admission)
 It is recommended in patients with at least one high-risk criteria.266-268
 This implies timely transfer of patients from non-PCI centres to PCI
capable hospitals.
 Invasive strategy (within 72 h of hospital admission)
 This is the recommended maximal delay for angiography in patients
with at least one intermediate risk criteria, recurrent symptoms or known
ischemia on non-invasive testing.150,262
 Routine invasive coronary angiogram is not recommended in low risk
patients. Patients with no recurrence of symptoms and none of the criteria
as listed in Table 2, page 38 are to be considered at low risk of ischaemic
events.148,269
These patients are recommended to have non-invasive assessment for
inducible or silent ischemia.270
In patients with extensive comorbidities, an invasive strategy should only
considered after evaluating the risk-benefit ratio (e.g., hepatic, renal, pulmonary
failure, cancer).
7.4.3. Routine early conservative management (selective invasive therapy)
This strategy can be advocated at non-PCI capable centres, where there are
barriers to PCI, in the elderly or in frail patients and patients with comorbidities
such as dementia, severe chronic renal insufficiency or cancer.
The use of aggressive anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents has also reduced
the incidence of adverse outcomes in patients managed conservatively. 148,269-271
Selective coronary angiography/ revascularization is indicated for those who
cannot be stabilised medically or in whom objective evidence of significant
ischemia is provoked in the sub-acute phase.
A conservative strategy is recommended for women who are stabilised and
remain biomarker negative.149,272
An early invasive or conservative strategy are both reasonable options for
men who are stabilised and remain biomarker negative.149,272

In initially stabilised patients, an ischemia-guided strategy may be considered
for patients with NSTE-ACS (without serious comorbidities or contraindications
to this approach) who have an elevated risk for clinical events.269,273,274
Patients with NSTE-ACS treated conservatively are at risk of developing
recurrent adverse cardiac events. Thus, these patients need to be evaluated
periodically for reversible ischemia using non-invasive tests. If there is a
change in symptoms or clinical condition or if ischemia is present, they should
be considered for coronary angiography and revascularization.
The main advantage offered by this selective ischemia-guided strategy is that
some patients’ conditions stabilise during medical therapy and will not require
coronary angiography and revascularization. Consequently, it may potentially
avoid costly and possibly unnecessary invasive procedures.
Wherever possible, patients who have undergone intervention should undergo
complete revascularization either at the same sitting or as a staged
procedure.275 The PCI of non-culprit lesions especially if they are between
50-70%, should be guided by Fractional Flow Reserve measurement:7,276
 FFR < 0.8 - intervene
 FFR > 0.8 - medical therapy
I,C
Key Messages 8#:
 An early as opposed to a delayed invasive strategy is safe and associated
with a lower risk of refractory ischemia and a shorter duration of hospital stay.
Key Recommendations 10:
 The selection of the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography and
revascularization should be guided by the individual’s risk for a MACE.
(Table 2, page 38) Patients at:
 Very high risk should undergo an immediate invasive strategy (<2 h).
 High risk should be recommended for an early invasive strategy (<24 h).
 Intermediate risk are recommended to undergo an invasive strategy but this
may be delayed for a maximum of 72 h window period from admission to
coronary angiography.
 Low risk should be assessed non-invasively for ischemia.
 All patients should receive optimal medical therapy consisting of DAPT,
statins and where necessary, anti-ischemic agents.

8. NSTE-ACS IN SPECIAL GROUPS
8.1 NSTE-ACS in Older Persons
Age is a powerful risk factor for CVD and also an independent risk factor for
adverse outcomes after CVD events, for complications after cardiovascular
procedures and interventions, and for side effects of pharmacotherapy.277
International registries show that 32% to 43% of NSTE-ACS, and about 24%
- 28% of STEMI admissions were for patients aged ≥ 75 years.278,279
These older persons with NSTE-ACS are more likely to be women, have
lower body mass indices, higher prevalence of such comorbidities as
hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, Transient Ischemic Attack/stroke,
anemia and renal insufficency.280,281
The mortality rate after a first non-STEMI in the oldest old patients is highest:
with respect to 1-year outcomes, among patients who were 65 - 79, 80 - 84,
85 - 89, and at least 90 years old, mortality increased progressively from
13.3% to 23.6%, 33.6%, and 45.5%, respectively.282
8.1.1 Clinical Presentation
A high index of suspicion is necessary to make a diagnosis of NSTE-ACS in
older patients. Only 40% of those aged >85 years had chest pain on
presentation compared with 77% of those aged <65 years.283 Older patients
were more likely to present with278:
 Dyspnea (49%)
 Diaphoresis (26%)
 Nausea and vomiting (24%)
 Neurological symptoms such as acute confusional states and syncope (19%)
Acute pulmonary edema is a common presentation of NSTE-ACS in the older
person.
Type 2 MI is also common in this age group, NSTE-ACS occurring in the setting
of another acute illness e.g. tachycardia, pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding episodes.
ECGs are often non diagnostic and serial ECGs are recommended to detect
evolving changes. 278
Cardiac troponins are commonly elevated > 99th percentile URL in older
patients presenting without ACS or other acute illnesses known to cause to
troponin elevation.284,285 In one study almost 40% of patients aged > 70years
had elevated troponins.285 The conventional cut-off value (99th percentile:
0.014 ng/mL) provided low specificity, particularly in older adults.286

(NSTE-ACS)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
3RD EDITION

81
The observed increased hs-cTn levels is associated with the presence of
pre-existing comorbidities which are independent of the effects of age.287 Mild
elevations of hs-cTnT levels are common in older patients, and increased
hs-cTn levels are an independent prognostic marker in this population.288,289
Elevations in cTn were independently associated with future cardiac events in
older women without apparent clinical manifestations.290 A different hs-cTnT
cut-off may be required for patients older than 70 years but this is currently
undefined.286-289
8.1.2. Management
Comparatively fewer studies have been conducted in older adults - specifically
older persons are under-represented in many studies on CAD. Therefore, the
strength of recommendations for this age group is somewhat lower than that
supporting recommendations in younger adults, highlighting the dire need to
conduct more research studies in this patient population.
There is limited trial data to guide management in the older person especially
in the setting of advanced age (more than 75 years) or significant comorbidity
(e.g. prior stroke, renal impairment). One should consider the biological age
rather than the chronological age of the patient when making management
decisions. This is almost always based on physician judgement rather than
on biological age predictors. There are several existing predictors which are
still in the research stage - the most plausible candidates being the epigenetic
clock and telomere length.291
Older patients are a heterogenous group and the risk benefit ratio of each
intervention should be individualised. As renal impairment is very common in
older adults, creatinine clearance should be calculated to enable appropriate
drug dosing (Appendix XIV, page 105).
Pharmacotherapy should also take into account the older person’s pill
burden, potential drug-drug interactions and the older person’s life expectancy.
Cooperation with experienced pharmacists is therefore desirable to optimise
pharmacotherapy.
8.1.2.1 Pharmacotherapy
 Antiplatelet Agents
 Both aspirin and clopidogrel (especially in those undergoing PCI)
confer greater benefits in older adults.279,292
 Clopidogrel is the P2Y12 inhibitor of choice in older persons > 75 years.293
 Prasugrel may be used in patients older than 75 years at the reduced
dose of 5mg.294,295

IIa,B
MANAGEMENT OF
NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(NSTE-ACS)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
3RD EDITION
2021
82
 Anticoagulants
 Both UFH and LMWH are equally effective in older persons.293,296
However bleeding risk is high with both agents. A reduced dose of
0.75-1.0mg/kg twice daily should be used in patients aged ≥75 years.293
 Fondaparinux is recommended in older NSTE-ACS patients and
those with STEMI who are not undergoing primary PCI. Fondaparinux
is associated with less bleeding than heparin and is as efficacious.
 Others:
 A high-dose statin regimen provides greater protection against death
or MACE than a low-or moderate-dose statin regimen in older
persons.297,298
8.1.2.2 Revascularization
 Older patients have greater in-hospital and long-term benefits with an
early invasive strategy.299-301 However, there is an increased risk of major
bleeding.
 When selecting patients for an early invasive strategy, the risk benefit
ratio must be considered. Most older patients with NSTE-ACS have
multivessel disease for which CABG is more suitable than PCI. Patient
preferences and frailty are important considerations in decision making.
In addition, duration of hospitalization and post-surgery convalescence
may be prolonged in older patients after CABG and, therefore, should be
considered in counselling the patient.
 For patients with multi vessel disease and not suitable for CABG, partial
revascularization of the culprit lesion may be a consideration.
8.1.2.3 Cardiac Rehabilitation
 Observational studies show that older patients have as much benefit as
younger patients with cardiac rehabilitation after an ACS.302,303
8.2 NSTE-ACS in Women
Women develop CAD about a decade later than men (after menopause) and
at that age have more comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension
and osteoarthritis.304,305 However, with the use of evidence-based treatment,
women have the same survival as men.306
Premenopausal women who develop NSTE-ACS however, have a higher
in-hospital mortality and worse long term outcomes than men of the same
age.304

8.2.1 Clinical Presentation
Women presenting with ACS often have atypical symptoms such as neck and
shoulder ache and dyspnea. Often, women have non-specific ECG changes
such as T wave changes even in the absence of heart disease, thus making
the diagnosis of CAD difficult.
8.2.2 Management
Women with NSTE-ACS:
 should be managed with the same pharmacological therapy as that for
men for acute care and for secondary prevention, with attention to
weight and/or renally calculated doses of antiplatelet and anticoagulant
agents to reduce bleeding risk304, 307-311
 and high-risk features (ie, troponin positive) should undergo an early
invasive strategy149,312,313
 and low-risk features and troponin negative should not undergo early
invasive treatment because of the lack of benefit149,312 and the possibility
of harm.149
8.3 NSTE-ACS in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
In patients with ACS, the presence of CKD is an additional high-risk feature
associated with increased mortality. The more severe the CKD, the higher the
mortality.314-316
8.3.1 Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ACS in patients with CKD is often difficult though essential.
 Traditional diagnostic tools such as symptoms and ECG’s are not always
helpful.
 The interpretation of cardiac biomarkers may also be difficult.
 cTn are increased in patients with CKD in the absence of clinical
myocardial ischemia, making their interpretation problematic.317
 While older cTn tests had a false-positive rate of 30% to 85% in
patients with stage 5 CKD, the hs-cTn tests display elevated levels in
almost 100% of these patients.62,317
 In suspected ACS, it is important to do serial testing of cTn over 6-8
hours rather than to rely on a single test result.318
 A distinct rise and fall in the levels over baseline correlated with
clinical suspicion of an ACS (new ischemic ECG changes or new
regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography), strongly
support the diagnosis of MI.318,319 A rise and/or fall is cTn may also occur
in acute volume overload and congestive heart failure.10
 Studies have shown that chronically elevated cTn levels is predictive
of increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events.320-322

8.3.2 Management
Patients with renal impairment were excluded from most clinical trials. In
general, the management of patients with CKD is similar to those with normal
renal function except for the following differences:
 Patients with CKD have more co-morbidity and are usually older.314
 They are at increased bleeding risks. The doses of antithrombotic agents
need to be adjusted accordingly to avoid excessive bleeding (Appendix VII,
page 99).323
 Medications:
 Antiplatelet agents -
• Although DAPT has become the standard of care in patients with
ACS and normal renal function, the benefits in persons with CKD
are uncertain and are potentially outweighed by bleeding hazards.323,324
In these patients, treatment should be individualised.
 Anticoagulants -
• Heparin (both UFH and LMWH) are widely used in ACS. The bleeding
risk of these agents however increases with the increasing severity
of baseline renal insufficiency.323 Dose adjustments are important.
(Appendix IX, page 101)
 Fondaparinux is contraindicated in severe renal failure (CrCl <20 mL/min)293
There are limited clinical data available on the use of Fondaparinux for
the treatment of UA/NSTEMI and STEMI in patients with creatinine
clearance between 20 to 30 ml/min.325 Therefore, the physician should
determine if the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk.
 Others - Similar absolute reduction in short-term mortality were
observed with the use of:
 Aspirin - 21% absolute reduction in mortality in dialysis patients, and a
23% reduction in non-dialysis patients.326
 β-blocker therapy was associated with a 14% absolute reduction in
mortality in both the dialysis and non-dialysis patients.326
 ACE-inhibitor use was associated with a 16% absolute reduction in
30-day mortality in dialysis patients and a 5% reduction in non-dialysis
patients.326
 Statins in combination with ezetimibe, however, was found only to be
beneficial in mild to moderate CKD. In patients on dialysis, there is a
lack of evidence concerning the cardio vascular benefits of statins.327
 Revascularization:
 An invasive strategy is superior and associated with a decrease in
mortality when compared to an initial conservative strategy (invasive
management only after failed medical therapy or for objective evidence
of ischemia).314

85
 An early invasive strategy is superior to a delayed invasive strategy,
the benefit, however, declines with lower renal function, and is less
certain in those with renal failure or on dialysis. 314,328,329
 PCI in patients with CKD is associated with increased risks of:
• bleeding
• worsening renal function and acute on chronic renal failure due to
contrast nephropathy and/or cholesterol embolization. Strategies
should be taken to reduce this risk.
• the procedure -These patients often have calcified, tortuous vessels
which increases the risk and complexity of PCI.
Key Messages 9#:
 When managing older patients, one should consider the biological age rather
than the chronological age.
 Older persons have greater in-hospital and long term benefits with an early
invasive strategy. However, there is an increased risk of major bleeding.
 Women should be managed with the same pharmacological therapy as that
for men for acute care and for secondary prevention.
 Women who are low risk and cTn negative, should be treated medically while
those who are cTn positive, should be considered for an invasive strategy.
 In general, patients with CKD should managed in a similar manner as those
with normal renal function. They however have a higher bleeding tendency
and doses of medications need to be adjusted according to the renal function.
 In patients with CKD, an early invasive strategy is superior to a delayed
invasive strategy. The benefit, however, declines with lower renal
function, and is less certain in those with renal failure or on dialysis.
The acute phase of NSTE-ACS is usually 1 to 3 months. The risk of
recurrence of ischemic events, STEMI or death is highest during this period.
Following this, most patients assume a clinical course similar to that of
patients with chronic stable angina.
Several lifestyle modification measures and drug therapies have been shown
to be effective in improving long-term outcome. However, they are underutilized.
Therefore, health care providers should ensure that patients with NSTE-ACS
receive appropriate treatment post-hospital discharge and ensure that
patients remain compliant to treatment.

Important discharge instructions (both verbal and written instructions) should
include:
 symptoms indicating worsening myocardial ischemia (chest pain/equivalent
and/or dyspnea) and how to seek emergency care.
 education on the benefits and potential side effects of the prescribed
medications.
 instructions on the proper and safe use of sublingual nitrates.
 lifestyle modification such as:
• smoking cessation,
• weight reduction and maintaining an ideal body weight
• regular exercise and
• a balanced diet
 importance of treating CVD risk factors (lipids, blood pressure, glucose)
to target.
 scheduling of timely follow-up appointments and dates for further investigations.
 referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program where appropriate.
Refer to Malaysian CPG on Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017, 1st Ed for further details.330
9.1 Medications Post-Discharge (Table 5)
These should include:
A. Antiplatelet agents
 DAPT consisting of a combination of:
 75-100mg daily aspirin.125,153 Currently, studies are still being conducted
to look at the optimal dose of aspirin in secondary prevention.331
+ (Plus) a P2Y12 Inhibitor either
 75mg daily clopidogrel152,153 (both medically treated and following PCI) or
 90mg bid ticagrelor156,332 (both medically treated and following PCI) or
 10mg daily prasugrel.173,176 (following PCI)
 The duration of DAPT in patients with NSTE-ACS will depend on the
thrombotic / ischemic versus bleeding risks. Ideally all patients should
receive DAPT for 9-12 months (both medically treated patients, those
post PCI and those who have undergone CABG).181,182
 However, in patients with high bleeding risks, a shorter period of DAPT
of 3 to 6 months may be considered.181,182,333
B. Lipid Modifying Therapy
 There is a large body of evidence that early initiation of high dose statin
therapy improves outcome regardless of baseline LDL-C levels in patient
with ACS.218-220,334-338

 More aggressive lipid lowering further lowers cardiovascular event
rates.217,227,228, 339-343
 If target LDL-C levels are not attained on maximally tolerated statin therapy
and especially if it still remains > 2.6 mmol/l, consider the addition of
ezetimibe and/or PCSK-9 inhibitors.232-235
C. In the presence of LVEF < 40% and /or Heart Failure
These should include:
 β -blockers203-207
 Renin Angiotensin Blockers (ACEIs/ARBs)212-216,344-348
 Aldosterone Receptor Antagonists- spironolactone, epleronone349-351
 Ivabradine - may be considered in patients on optimal medical therapy
with diuretics, ACE-I, MRA and β-blockers, and247,352
 still symptomatic (NYHA class II-III), and
 having a LVEF ≤ 35%, and
 having a resting heart rate of ≥ 70 beats/min.
 Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors - these agents have
been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in both diabetic and
non-diabetic patients. In the large trials, they have been been instituted
when the patient is stable.353-356
 Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNi) has been shown to
cause a greater reduction in NT- Pro BNP levels than ACEI in patients
with acute decompensated heart failure.357 However when instituted
early in patients post ACS (STEMI and NSTE-ACS), it did not outperform
ACEI in cardiovascular event reduction.358
D. In the presence of Angina and/or myocardial ischemia
Anti-ischaemic therapy includes:7
 Sublingual nitroglycerin should be administered and patients instructed
on its use.
 β-blockers and/or CCBs should be prescribed as first-line treatment to
reduce angina because it is widely available.
 Ivabradine, trimetazidine, long-acting nitrates and ranolazine are recom
mended as add-on therapy in patients who remain symptomatic.
E. Other co-existing Clinical conditions:
 Atrial Fibrillation
In NSTE-ACS patients with AF who had undergone PCI, the use of DOAC
with antiplatelet therapy is associated with a lower risk of bleeding than
the standard triple therapy (DAPT + warfarin).353-355

The following regimens may be considered:
1. Warfarin + DAPT
 Target INR in the lower part of the recommended target range (INR: 2)356,357
 The use of ticagrelor or prasugrel is not recommended as part of triple
antithrombotic therapy with aspirin and OAC.358
2. DOAC + DAPT
 Dabigatran 110 or 150mg twice daily + aspirin <100mg daily + clopidogrel
75mg once daily for one to six months depending on bleeding risks
followed by antiplatelet monotherapy and dabigatran 110 or 150mg
twice daily.353 or
 Rivaroxaban 15mg once daily (10mg if CrCl 30-50ml/min) + aspirin +
clopidogrel 75mg once daily for one to six months depending on
bleeding risks followed by antiplatelet monotherapy and rivaroxaban
15mg once daily.354 or
 Rivaroxaban 2.5mg twice daily and aspirin 75-100mg once daily and
clopidogrel 75mg once daily for one to 12 months.354 The duration of
DAPT with this combination will depend on the risk of stent thrombosis
versus bleeding risk.
 Apixaban 5mg bid and clopidogrel 75mg once daily for 6 months
resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations without significant
differences in the incidence of ischemic events when compared to
regimens that included warfarin, aspirin, or both.355
 Diabetes and/or proteinuria and/or CKD
 Renin Angiotensin Blockers (ACEIs/ARBs)
 Hypertension
 β-blockers,
 Renin Angiotensin Blockers,
 calcium channel blockers
Evidence supporting the routine use of β-blockers and ACEI/ARB > 1-year post
NSTE-ACS for the treatment of stable CAD only is less well established. 208-211, 359-362
9.2 Investigations During Follow Up (Flowchart 2, page 36)
In the outpatient evaluation of low risk NSTE-ACS patients, the following
investigations maybe considered:
 Echocardiogram to assess LV function
 Treadmill stress test
 Stress echocardiogram - treadmill or pharmacological stress
 Nuclear perfusion study
 Cardiac Magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) - stress MRI for ischemia
and perfusion MRI for viability
Patients with significant demonstrable ischemia should be considered for
revascularization.

Key Recommendations 12:
 Low risk patients should be assessed non-invasively for ischemia. (Flowchart 2,
page 36)
 If they have troubling symptoms and/or significant myocardial ischemia, they
should be referred for coronary angiography with view to revascularization.
Cardiac rehabilitation is aimed at improving the physical and psychological
well-being of the patient. It has been shown to reduce mortality by
approximately 20%-25%.363-365 There was also a trend towards reduction in
non-fatal recurrent MI over a median follow-up of 12 months.366
Angina management programs have been shown to decrease the episodes
of chest pain by 70%, reduce nitrate use by 65% and improve exercise
tolerance by 57%.366
All eligible patients with NSTE-ACS should be referred to a comprehensive
cardiovascular rehabilitation program either as in-patient or during the first
outpatient visit where available.367-371
These comprehensive programs provide patient education, enhance regular
exercise, monitor risk factors, and address lifestyle modification.372 Aerobic
exercise training can generally begin 1 to 2 weeks after discharge in patients
treated with PCI or CABG.373 Mild-to-moderate resistance training can be
I,B
10. CARDIAC REHABILITATION
Key Recommendations 11:
 Patients should be on optimal medical therapy at discharge. This includes:
 DAPT with aspirin + clopidogrel (or ticagrelor or prasugrel)
 And High intensity statins to achieve LDL-C target of < 1.8 mmol/l (preferably
< 1.4 mmol/l), the lower the better.
 And in the presence of angina /myocardial ischemia, β-blockers and/or
CCBs should be prescribed as first-line treatment and ivabradine, trimetazidine,
long-acting nitrates and ranolazine are recommended as add-on therapy in
patients who remain symptomatic.
 And in the presence of LVEF< 40% and heart failure, β-blockers, Renin
Angiotensin Blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) and Aldosterone Receptor Antagonists-
spironolactone, eplerenone should be given. SGLT2-inhibitors can be
instituted in both stable diabetic and non-diabetic patients..

considered and started 2 to 4 weeks after aerobic training.374 Additional
restrictions apply when residual ischemia is present and patient has not been
revascularized.
Exercise training should not be prescribed in patients during the first week
after an acute MI and in those with progressive and unstable angina.375
Regular physical activity reduces symptoms in patients with cardiovascular
disease, enhances functional capacity, improves other risk factors such as
insulin resistance and glucose control, and is important in weight control.372
Smoking is an independent risk factor for CVD that accelerates atherosclerosis
and has been linked with other mechanisms that precipitate thrombosis,
hemorrhage, or vasoconstriction, which can all lead to ACS. It also interacts
with other CV risk factors, such as hypertension, glucose intolerance and low
serum levels of HDL-C.376,377 The risk of developing diabetes is 30 - 40%
higher for active smokers than nonsmokers.376
Stopping smoking is an important and effective preventive measure.376 There
is significant reduction on morbidity within the first 6 months of quitting and
the risks of CVD almost equals the risk of never smokers after 10 - 15
years of cessation.376 For smoking interventions please refer to the
Malaysian CPG on Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. 1st Ed, 2017378
and the Recommendations of the Steering Committee on Tobacco control in
Malaysia (Appendix XV,pages 106-110).384
10.1 Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs (CRP)
These include:
 Counselling and educating the patient and family members on CAD and
medications used to treat the conditions.
 Beginning an exercise program.
 Helping the patient modify risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking,
high blood cholesterol, physical inactivity, obesity and diabetes.
 Providing vocational guidance to enable the patient to return to work.
 Supplying information on physical limitations.
 Educating and ensuring compliance to medications.
 Providing emotional support.

There are 4 Phases using the Wenger Model:376
 Acute phase (Phase I):
 This is the in-hospital period immediately following the MI and leading
up to discharge.
 It involves early mobilisation of the patient.
 It can be started after 48 hours of hospitalisation in stable patients.
 Convalescent phase (Phase II):
 This is at home/convalescent hospital.
 This continues the program started in phase I until the myocardial scar
has matured.
 Training phase (Phase III):
 This is initiated after about 4 to 6 weeks and the patient is safe for
aerobic exercise.
 Maintenance (Phase IV):
 This is home-based regular exercise to maintain aerobic conditioning
gains made in phase III.
Exercise training programs should include warm-up, resistance training,
endurance training, and cool-down. Examples:
 Warm-up: stretching, warm-up exercise, low-intensity (slow) walking.
 Main exercises: aerobic exercise and resistance training at prescribed
intensity.
 Cool-down: low-intensity (slow) walking, stretching, cooling-down exercise.
10.2 Return to Physical Activity
Physical activity can be resumed at 50% of maximal exercise capacity in a
patient with preserved LV function without inducible ischemia within 1 week
post-discharge. This should be gradually increased over time preferably
guided by treadmill stress test.
Exercise begins with low-level aerobic exercises of the upper and lower limbs
at an intensity that is below his/her angina threshold.
Daily walking can be encouraged soon after discharge for most patients.
It is strongly recommended that post-ACS patients achieve ≥30 minutes of
low-moderate aerobic activity such as brisk walking on at least 5 days per
week within 2 weeks of discharge.330

10.3 Risk Factor Modification:
 Smoking cessation - Patients who quit smoking can reduce the rate of
reinfarction and death as early as 1 year.
 Weight - Achieve or maintain optimal body weight.
 Exercise - Encourage a minimum of 30 - 60 minutes of moderate activity
5 times weekly (walking, cycling, swimming or other equivalent aerobic
activities).
 Diet - To consume low cholesterol or low saturated fat diet.
 Lipids - Aim for an LDL-C < 1.8mmol/l, preferably <1.4mmol/l.
 Hypertension - Aim for a blood pressure of <140/85mmHg. In diabetics
the target is < 130/80mmHg. In elderly patients, a higher BP target may
be acceptable.
 Diabetes mellitus - Optimal glycemic control in diabetes. (Refer CPG on
Diabetes)

Implementation of the recommendations listed in this CPG can be accomplished by:
 Continuous medical education via regular seminars, lectures and
roadshows particularly at the district hospital and family medicine clinics.
Education and training is the most important aspect of the implementation
of this CPG.
 Widespread availability of this CPG to healthcare providers via printed
copies, electronic websites, etc.
Key Recommendations 13:
 Regular audit of performance and outcome measures (Table 7, page 42)
should be performed periodically to monitor and improve quality of care.

APPENDIX XIV: CALCULATION OF eGFR FOR DRUG DOSING ADJUSTMENTS
Estimated GFR (eGFR) can be derived from various equations including:
 CKD-EPI Creatinine (CKD -EPI) Equation- (most commonly used)
 Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) Equation.
In a local population, the CKD-EPI Equation performs just as well as CKD-MDRD for
GFR 60-89ml/min and better at the other GFR levels.380
In practice, there are number of simple calculators that may be accessed to calculate
eGFR, for example:
https://qxmd.com/calculate/calculator_251/egfr-using-ckd-epi
https://www.mdcalc.com/mdrd-gfr-equation
Creatinine clearance (Cr Cl) is determined by the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) Equation.In
the past, this equation was used for drug dosing adjustments based on creatinine
clearance. However, in more recent practice, the CKD-EPI equation tends to be
used for drug dosing based on eGFR, especially for newer generation drugs.
However, drug dosing adjustment should be done according to the United States
Food and Drug Administrative - or European Medicines Agency-approved product
labelling.

APPENDIX XV :SMOKING AND CHRONIC NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
Recommendations of the Steering Committee on Tobacco control in Malaysia
Smoking of tobacco and tobacco products (cigarette, electronic cigarette/ vape,
shisha, pipe, cigar etc.) can lead to various complications of chronic non communicable diseases (NCD) such as coronary heart disease, cancers and chronic lung
disease. It is the main cause of death worldwide whereby 6 million people die every
year as a consequence of this habit (WHO Tobacco Fact Sheet, 2016).
Smoking has been classified as a chronic disease under Tobacco/Nicotine Dependence in International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnostic code since 2015
and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV Criteria).
In Malaysia, smoking kills around 20,000 people a year (Tobacco Atlas, 2015) while
the cost of treating three out of six chronic diseases related to tobacco was estimated around MYR 2.92 billion (Global Adults Tobacco Survey, 2011).
The National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2019 estimated that the prevalence
of current tobacco smoker in Malaysia age 15 years and above was 21.3%, with
approximately 4.8 million people with males being higher than females (male:
40.5%, female: 1.2%). There was a small decline from the 2015 NHMS where the
prevalence of active tobacco smoker was 22.8%, male was 43% and female was
1.4%.
The Tobacco and E-cigarette Survey Among Adolescents (TECMA) 2016 has stated
the prevalence of smoker among adolescent age between 13 to 15 years was 14.8%
as compared to 13.2% which was reported in the National Health and Morbidity
Survey (NHMS): Adolescent Health 2017. The prevalence of smoker among boys
dropped from 26.1% in 2016 (TECMA) to 20.6% in 2017 (NHMS). However, the
prevalence of smoker among girls increased from 2.4% in 2016 (TECMA) to 5.7% in
2017 (NHMS).
Hence, the decision for treatment of smoking to be integrated with other chronic non
communicable diseases was made during the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) Steering Committee Meeting in
December 2019 chaired by the honorable Health Minister of Malaysia.
The treatment for smoking is based on Clinical Practice Guideline: Treatment for
Tobacco Use Disorder 2016-(Tables A-D)

NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(NSTE-ACS)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
3RD EDITION

107
Table A: Assessment And Treatment Tobacco Use Disorder
ASSESSMENT & TREATMENT
Ask and document smoking status for all patients.
Provide brief advice on quit smoking at every visit to all smokers.
Assess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerström Test for Cigarette
Dependence Questionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using
carbon monoxide (CO) breath analyser (IF AVAILABLE).
Offer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless
contraindicated.
If selected, use NRT for at least eight to twelve weeks, whereas varenicline
should be used for at least twelve weeks.
Combination therapy (e.g., two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g. bupropion with a NRT) is
better than monotherapy in smoking cessation treatment and may be most useful
for those smokers at highest risk of relapse.
Use smoking cessation medications with caution in special populations (e.g.,
children and adolescents, pregnant, breastfeeding women, psychiatric and
substance abuse disorder patients).
Arrange a minimum of six to eight face to face follow-up sessions for smoking
cessation interventions in six months through counselling support team (Health
education officer, pharmacists or any officer trained for quit smoking services).
