STATEMENT OF INTENT
These guidelines update and supplant the previous guidelines developed in 2005 and are based on
the best available contemporary evidence. They are intended as a guide for the best clinical practice
in the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molar teeth presently. However, it must be
noted that adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in
individual patient care, as every health care provider is responsible for the management of his/her
unique patient based on the clinical presentation and management options available locally.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES
These guidelines were issued in November 2021 and will be reviewed in 2026 or earlier if important
new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, the head of the related specialty will
be informed about it. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will be done on the need
for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. The systematic review methodology used by
the Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed in reviewing the
guidelines.
Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of publication.
However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this
document, which is the definitive version at all times.

Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) were developed by a multidisciplinary expert
committee consisting of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, a Paediatric Dental Specialist, a
Periodontist, an Orthodontist and a Dental Officer mainly from the Ministry of Health and the
Ministry of Higher Education.
The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar
Teeth (December 2005) was used as the basis for the development of these guidelines. The
recommendations were formulated taking into consideration the best available evidence and
local practices. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. The scope has
been expanded to include new and updated information. In addition, clinical audit indicators
have also been identified for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.
Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases: Medline,
Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and Embase while full text
journal articles were retrieved from these databases. The literature search was limited to
human study, English language and published articles from 2006 to September 2021. In
addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further
identify relevant studies. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cutoff date. An example of the search strategy used can be found in Appendix 1. Details of the
search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.
There were five (5) clinical questions which were assigned to members of the development
group. The group members met a total of 22 times throughout the development of these
guidelines. All retrieved articles were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme
(CASP) checklist by at least two members, presented in the form of evidence tables and
discussed during group meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were
agreed upon by both the development group and reviewers. This CPG is based on the
findings of systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, observational studies and case
reports, with local practices taken into consideration. However, when there was lack of
evidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group members. Although ideally
patients’ views and preferences need to be considered in the development of CPGs, in this
instance, it was not feasible.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US / Canadian Preventive
Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the formulation of recommendation was
done using the principles of GRADE. The writing of the CPG strictly follows the requirements
of Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE II).
The draft was reviewed by a panel of internal and external reviewers. Recommendations
were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, and finally to the HTA and
CPG Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for approval.
GENERAL OBJECTIVE
To provide evidence-based recommendations for the best management practices of
unerupted and/or impacted third molar teeth.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

INTRODUCTION
Third molars, also known as wisdom teeth, are generally the last teeth to erupt after the age
of seventeen. The position of the teeth is posterior to the second molars, where space can be
limited for the eruption to take place. Impaction of third molars can be due to several factors,
including lack of space, obstruction by adjacent structures or tooth and abnormal position
during tooth development. 1 Impacted third molars can be entirely or partially covered by
bone and/or soft tissue. Wisdom teeth that are partially erupted in dental arches are usually
visible clinically, but have not achieved the normal functional position.
The average rate of third molar impaction worldwide was 24.4% in adults 17 years and above.
The prevalence of mandibular impaction (25.4%) was significantly higher than maxillary
impaction (14.2%). Adults with impacted wisdom teeth would commonly have one or two
impacted wisdom teeth rather than three or four impacted teeth. There was no significant
predilection between genders on the occurrence of impacted third molars. In terms of angle
of impaction, clinicians would more likely encounter mesio-angular impaction (41.2%),
followed by vertical (25.6%), disto-angular (12.2%) and horizontal impaction (11.1%). 2
The introduction of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has led clinicians to consider
its usage for three-dimensional assessment of third molars and its relationship with adjacent
structures, particularly inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). However, there is a need to address its
clinical usefulness in these cases.
Surgical removal of third molar is associated with the risk of IAN injury. In the last two
decades, a new surgical technique, coronectomy, has been introduced to reduce the risk
of IAN injury. There has been much debate among clinicians with regards to this technique.
In view of new developments in the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molar,
this CPG is updated to include the aforementioned issues. Thus, evidence-based decision
making in managing unerupted and impacted third molars is necessary to allow clinicians
to identify and assess updated multifactorial aspects relevant to the management of this
specific dental condition.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
2.
DIAGNOSIS
2.1
History Taking & Clinical Examination
Unerupted and/or impacted third molar is diagnosed clinically by detailed history taking and
good clinical examination. Common signs and symptoms for this condition include:
•
pain
•
swelling
•
trismus
•
fever
Imaging may be required to confirm the diagnosis and to observe the morphology of the tooth
and surrounding structures and associated pathological conditions (e.g. caries, periodontal
disease and cyst).
2.2
Imaging
2.2.1 Plain Radiography
The most commonly used plain radiographs in the management of unerupted and/or impacted
third molar are orthopantomogram (OPG) and intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Three
meta-analyses studied the predictors of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) exposure in OPG among
patients with impacted mandibular third molars. The number of primary studies ranged from
five to nine and of moderate quality. The sensitivities and specificities of the predictors are
shown in the following table. 3-5, level III
Table 1. Sensitivities and Specificities of Predictors in IAN Exposure
Predictor
Range of Sensitivity (CI)
Range of Specificity (CI)
Darkening of root
0.49 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.60) to
0.56 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.61)
0.81 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.83) to
0.89 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.90)
Interruption of radiopaque
border of mandibular canal
0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.48) to
0.54 (95% CI 0.44 to 0. 64)
0.80 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.82) to
0.84 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.85)
Diversion of mandibular canal
0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.97) to
0.294 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.38)
0.95 (95% CI 0.936 to 0.957) to
0.96 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.97)
Narrowing of canal
0.15 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.26)
0.95 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.96)
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
Darkening of root and interruption of radiopaque border of mandibular canal were better
in predicting inferior alveolar nerve injury compared with other predictors. However, it was
concluded that more high quality evidence is required before OPG can be recommended in
IAN assessment. 3-5, level III
Key Message 1
•
OPG is used when IOPA is unable to show the relationship between IAN and the
third molar.
2.2.2
Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)
CBCT is a recent advancement in dental imaging that provides a three-dimensional view of
the relationships between orofacial structures. It is widely used in diagnosis and treatment
planning of unerupted and/or impacted third molar.
A systematic review studied the diagnostic accuracy of CBCT compared with OPG in
predicting exposure of IAN in impacted third molar. Two diagnostic studies showed conflicting
results in the comparison. Due to limited evidence in the systematic review, a firm conclusion
cannot be made. 6, level I
Key Message 2
•
In view of limited evidence, CBCT imaging is indicated in cases where conventional
(panoramic and/or intraoral) imaging cannot provide satisfactory diagnostic
information.
3.
INDICATIONS
The decision to remove the impacted third molars must be made with due consideration to
the patient’s overall health status and the potential risks of complications. The indications of
removing the impacted third molars are discussed below.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
3.1
Caries
In a meta-analysis of moderate quality cross-sectional studies, the presence of third molars
led to increased risk of caries in adjacent molars: 7, level III
•
Third molars in A versus C positions (OR=3.45, 95% CI 2.28 to 5.22) based on Pell &
Gregory classification (Figure 1).
•
Third molars in horizontal versus vertical (OR=8.12, 95% CI 3.75 to 17.58) and
distoangular (OR=9.75, 95% CI 3.49 to 27.25) positions based on Winter’s classification
(Figure 2).
•
Third molars in mesioangular vs vertical (OR=7.25, 95% CI 3.48 to 15.10) and
distoangular (OR=9.54, 95% CI 3.47 to 26.21) positions based on Winter’s classification.

molar.
Class B impaction. Occlusal
plane of impacted tooth is
between occlusal plane
and cervical line of second
molar.
Class C impaction.
Impacted tooth is below
cervical line of second
molar.
Figure 2. Winter’s Classification 9
However, in another Cochrane systematic review with moderate risk of bias, a cohort study
showed no difference in the prevalence of distal caries associated with the adjacent second
molar in the absence compared with the presence of bony impacted wisdom teeth (RR=0.69,
95% CI 0.27 to 1.82). 10, level I
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
In local setting, removal of third molar should be considered when caries is present in third molar
and unlikely to be restored. Removal may also be considered when there is distal caries on the
second molar.
Key Message 3
•
The clinical status of second molar is important to determine the need or indication
for the removal of third molar.
Recommendation 1
•
Removal of third molars may be considered to reduce the risk of dental caries in the
adjacent second molars.
3.2
Periodontal Problems
In a Cochrane systematic review, presence of third molar can secondarily lead to greater
probing depth (RR=0.63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.04) and alveolar bone loss on the distal surface
of second molar (RR=0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.54). 10, level I
In the same review, the absence of third molar compared to when it is present showed: 10, level I
•
reduced risk of probing depth >4 mm associated with distal of adjacent second molar
in the presence of soft tissue impaction (RR=0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34) but not in bony
impaction (RR=0.63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.04).
•
reduced risk of alveolar bone loss at distal of adjacent second molar in presence of soft
tissue or bony impaction with RR of 0.11 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.22) and 0.32 (95% CI 0.19 to
0.54) respectively.
Recommendation 2
•
Removal of third molars may be considered in reducing periodontal problem in
adjacent second molars.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
3.3
Crowding
In a Cochrane systematic review, a randomised clinical trial (RCT) comparing surgical
removal and retention of asymptomatic disease-free third molars showed no significant
effect on dimensional changes in the dental arch (crowding): 10, level I
•
Little’s irregularity index (mean difference, MD= -0.3 mm, 95% CI -1.3 to 0.7)
•
Intercanine width (MD= -0.01 mm, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.35)
Although there were differences in arch length (MD= -1.03 mm, 95% CI -0.56 to -1.50), it was
unlikely to be clinically significant. 10, level I However, this RCT had high risk of bias. Thus, the
systematic review did not provide strong evidence to support or refute the prophylactic removal
of disease-free impacted third molars to prevent crowding.
3.4
Cyst / Pathology
Impacted third molars should be removed when it is associated with cyst / tumour. 11, level III
3.5
In the line of Mandibular Fracture
Angle of the mandible is a common site for mandibular fracture. Impacted lower third molar
can be in the line of the fracture and poses possible complications such as infection if not
removed. Generally, removal of an impacted third molar may be considered based on clinical
judgment.
3.6
Orthognathic Surgery
One of the complications during bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) in orthognathic surgery
is bad split, which is an unwanted pattern of fracture. A meta-analysis showed no significant
difference in the incidence of bad split between lower third molars removed concomitantly
during surgery and at least six months preoperatively (OR=1.16, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.85). 12, level II-2
However, lower third molars are usually removed prior to surgery in clinical practice.
3.7
Asymptomatic Third Molar
The prophylactic removal of asymptomatic third molars is defined as removal of third molars
in the absence of local diseases. Based on a Cochrane systematic review, there was
insufficient evidence to determine removal of asymptomatic impacted third molars. 10, level I
However, consideration needs to be given to the risk to the adjacent second molar or there
may be other possible risks to retention of third molar due to patient’s medical or surgical
condition. The clinician needs to balance the risks and benefits with patient’s involvement.

TREATMENT
4.1
Conservative
A Cochrane systematic review could not provide sufficient evidence to support the removal
or retention of asymptomatic third molars in preventing further problems e.g: crowding and
cyst formation. 10, level I
4.2
Surgical
4.2.1
Surgical Procedure
The surgical procedure in removal of impacted third molar generally involves:
•
raising of soft tissue flaps (triangular or envelope) for exposure with or without lingual
flap retraction
•
removing bone using either chisel or bur with irrigation
•
delivering the whole tooth with or without prior division
•
performing wound toilet and suturing
A Cochrane systematic review consisting of low to moderate quality primary studies evaluated
the relative beneﬁts and risks of different techniques for undertaking various aspects or
stages of the surgical removal of mandibular wisdom teeth. The review concluded that: 13, level I
•
Triangular ﬂaps were associated with reduction in pain at 24 hours (MD= -0.21, 95% CI
-0.32 to -0.10) and a 71% reduction in alveolar osteitis at one week (RR=0.29, 95% CI
0.11 to 0.78) compared with envelope ﬂaps. There was no difference in overall infection
rates, maximum mouth opening or permanent loss of sensation. However, there was
slight increase in residual swelling after one week in the triangular ﬂap (MD=0.66 mm,
95% CI 0.26 to 1.07).
•
Lingual flap retraction caused more temporary altered sensation up to one month
(Peto OR=5.19, 95% CI 1.38 to 19.49).
•
No conclusion could be made on bone removal using bur or chisel in view of small
number of studies and heterogeneity in the outcomes.
There is insufficient evidence on the use of lingual flap retraction and bone removal in
impacted third molar surgery. However, in local practice, lingual flap retraction is generally
not performed because of the possible injury to lingual nerve, while bur is usually used for
bone removal.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
Recommendation 3
•
Triangular or envelope flap may be used in the surgical removal of impacted
mandibular third molars.
4.2.2
Coronectomy
Coronectomy is an alternative procedure for surgical removal of impacted mandibular third
molars that present with a high risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury. The main aim of coronectomy
technique is to prevent inferior alveolar nerve injury by removing the wisdom tooth crown and
leaving behind the roots that show signs of proximity with IAN undisturbed. 14, level I
Key criteria for coronectomy include: 15, level III
•
high risk of IAN injury
•
vital mandibular third molar
•
healthy non-immunocompromised patient
•
access to care for (and understanding of) related coronectomy risks
4.2.2.1 Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) Injury
In a meta-analysis of moderate quality RCTs and CCTs, coronectomy has lower risk of IAN
injury probability (OR=0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.36) than total removal of the mandibular third
molar. 14, level I
4.2.2.2 Post-Operative Pain
Similar meta-analysis reported that there was no significant difference between total removal
of third molars and coronectomy in post-operative pain (OR=0.8, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.66). 14, level I
4.2.2.3 Post-Operative Infection
There was no significant difference in the risk of post-operative infection between total
removal of third molars and coronectomy (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.84). 14, level I
4.2.2.4 Dry Socket / Alveolar Osteitis
The risk of dry socket occurrence in coronectomy was lower in comparison with total removal
of mandibular third molar (OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.96). 14, level I
4.2.2.5 Root Migration
There is possibility of root migration in post-coronectomy cases. However, the occurrence of
root migration could not be pooled due to lack of homogenous data. 14, level I
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
4.2.2.6 Reoperation
From a systematic review of moderate quality RCTs and CCTs, the incidence of reoperation
for removal of retained root after initial successful coronectomy is infrequent, ranging
between 0.6% to 6.9%. 16, level I
Recommendation 4
•
Coronectomy may be considered in the management of unerupted and/or impacted
mandibular third molar which has close proximity with the IAN to reduce the risk of
IAN injury.
4.3
Perioperative Treatment
4.3.1
Analgesics
Analgesic is an important component in the management of impacted third molar. In a
Cochrane systematic review, ibuprofen 400 mg was reported to be more effective than
paracetamol 1000 mg in postoperative pain management following the surgical removal of
lower wisdom teeth. 17, level I
•
The risk ratio of patient with >50% maximum total pain relief (TOTPAR) over two hours
was 1.30 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.55)
•
The risk ratio of patient with >50% TOTPAR over six hours was 1.47 (95% CI 1.28 to
1.69)
In another comparison, combined analgesics (ibuprofen and paracetamol) was more
effective than single drugs in achieving >50% TOTPAR over six hours (RR=1.77, 95% CI
1.32 to 2.39). 17, level I All drugs studied in this review were generally considered safe with
minimal side effects noted when used for short-term pain relief. The quality of primary papers
was generally moderate.
In another meta-analysis, three out of five RCTs reported better analgesic efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared with tramadol in surgical removal of
third molars. The other two RCTs showed similar efficacy. In terms of safety, 21.8% (95% CI
13.81 to 29.86) of patients experienced adverse effects from tramadol with number needed
to harm (NNH) of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3 to 7.2). 18, level I However, there was no mention of the quality
assessment of the primary papers.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
In local setting, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium, celecoxib and etoricoxib are
commonly prescribed for removal of third molars. Tramadol is usually used for patients when
NSAIDs are contraindicated. Paracetamol is used in combination with NSAIDs or Tramadol
for breakthrough pain control.
Recommendation 5
•
Analgesics should be prescribed for removal of third molars.
o Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the preferred option.
4.3.2
Antibiotics
Infection is one of the complications in post-operative unerupted impacted third molar. Two
meta-analyses addressed the use of antibiotics as prophylaxis for this condition.
In a Cochrane systematic review of 18 RCTs, any regimen of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis
administered before or after third molar removal compared with placebo in healthy patients
resulted in reduction of: 19, level I
•
infection (RR=0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.50)
•
pain (MD= -8.17, 95% CI -11.90 to -4.45)
•
dry socket (RR=0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.95)
A recent good quality meta-analysis of five RCTs showed that prophylactic amoxycillin
reduced the risk of infection compared with no treatment / placebo in healthy patients before
and after removal of third molar but not significant (OR=0.26, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.17). 20, level I
The antibiotics were associated with an increase in mild and transient adverse effects
compared with placebo (RR=1.98, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.59). 19, level I However, there was no
increased risk of adverse effects in the amoxicillin group compared with no treatment /
placebo (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.60). 20, level I
In an evidence-based local guidelines on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in oral surgery for
prevention of surgical site infection, antibiotic prophylaxis may be indicated for minor surgery
with a high degree of difficulty in which the duration of the surgery is predicted to be long.
21, level III In local setting, prophylactic amoxicillin has been given in lower third molar surgery
when there is significant bone removal and/or prolonged operation time.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
Recommendation 6
•
Antibiotics may be considered in third molar surgery when there is significant
bone removal and/or prolonged operation time.
o Amoxicillin is the preferred option.
4.3.3
Corticosteroids
A meta-analysis on 12 clinical trials showed that various types of perioperative corticosteroids
significantly reduced early and late oedema and trismus but not pain. 22, level I The primary
papers used were of moderate quality. The time of administration and dosage of the
corticosteroids varied among studies.
In another meta-analysis of 11 moderate quality RCTs, submucosal injection of
dexamethasone compared with control (inactive treatment) showed: 23, level I
•
reduced oedema in early (standard mean difference, SMD=3.28, 95% CI 2.21 to 4.36)
and late (SMD=0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.86) period post-surgery
•
reduced trismus in early (SMD=5.34, 95% CI 2.44 to 8.24) and late (SMD=1.84, 95%
CI 0.38 to 3.29) period post-surgery
The outcome on pain could not be pooled because of heterogeneity.
In the papers that were reviewed, the side effects of corticosteroids used in third molar
surgeries were not well addressed.
Recommendation 7
•
Corticosteroids should be used in third molar surgery to reduce post-surgery
oedema and trismus when there is no contraindication.
4.3.4
Mouthwash
In a Cochrane systematic review, rinsing perioperatively with chlorhexidine (0.12% and 0.2%)
was effective in preventing dry socket after the extraction of third molar teeth (RR=0.58, 95%
CI 0.43 to 0.78). There were no serious side effects or reactions reported unless there was
allergic reaction to chlorhexidine. 24, level I
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
Recommendation 8
•
Chlorhexidine mouthwash should be used in third molar surgery to prevent dry
socket.
4.4
Treatment of Complications
The complications rate of third molar surgery ranges from 9.1% to 12.6%. The most common
complications are: 25, level III
•
dry socket / alveolar osteitis (0.3% - 35%)
•
wound infection / post-operative infection (1% - 16%)
•
post-operative bleeding (1.5%)
•
lingual and inferior alveolar nerve injuries
o transient disturbances of the inferior alveolar nerve (0.4 - 0.6%)
o transient disturbances of the lingual nerve (0.06 - 11.5%)
o permanent nerve disturbances (0.2 - 1%)
4.4.1
Dry Socket / Alveolar Osteitis
A Cochrane systematic review was unable to provide sufficient evidence to recommend any
treatment for dry socket. 24, level I
4.4.2
Wound Infection / Post-Operative Infection
Based on clinical judgement, it is suggested that antibiotics should be given to treat
established post-operative infection.
4.4.3
Post-Operative Bleeding
Post-operative bleeding from surgical removal of unerupted and/or impacted third molars
can originate from local or systemic causes. Due to limited evidence, it is suggested that
post-operative bleeding should be treated accordingly.
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
4.4.4
Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) Injury
The improvement of neurosensory deficit with surgical and non-surgical treatment varies.
This was not evaluated in any RCT and thus no firm conclusion can be drawn on it at present.
4.4.5
Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF)
Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is platelet concentrates that act as a reservoir and release of
important growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming
growth factor (TGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). In a meta-analysis of low
to moderate quality RCTs with moderate risk of bias, the use of PRF in post-operative
mandibular third molar removal: 26, level I
•
reduced post-operative pain on day-3 (SMD= -0.53, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.05)
•
reduced swelling on day-1 (WMD= -0.55, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.01)
•
reduced risk of alveolar osteitis (RR=0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.75)
•
had no significant improvement on trismus, osteoblastic activity and soft tissue healing.
However, there is limited evidence on the use of PRF in reduction of pain, swelling and
alveolar osteitis. Therefore, there is no strong clinical benefit on the use of PRF in postoperative third molar surgeries.
4.5
Follow-Up
There was insufficient evidence to recommend a specific follow-up. The Faculty of Dentistry
England 2020 recommended that active surveillance or clinical review may be considered
for third molars which are not indicated for removal. 15, level III
The American Association of Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon (AAOMS) recommended that the
frequency of follow-up visits be approximately every 24 months and the examination be
completed by a specialist or general dentist. Active surveillance as a management strategy
is based on expert opinion. 15, level III
In local setting, monitoring of unerupted and/or impacted third molars and post-coronectomy
should be done as part of routine dental check-up annually in view of future diseases that
may be associated with retained third molars.
Recommendation 9
•
Third molars and post-coronectomy cases should be monitored periodically. Patients
should be made aware of the risks that can arise even when it is asymptomatic and
be involved in the decision making.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
It is important to standardise the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molars in
an appropriate manner at all healthcare levels in Malaysia using an evidence-based CPG
in order to manage it appropriately. Clinicians are required to keep abreast with knowledge
through continuing professional education as well as understanding of patients’ expectations.
Therefore, it is important for these guidelines to be disseminated to all healthcare
professionals in primary and secondary healthcare facilities. This can be facilitated through
the development of appropriate training modules and quick references. Several factors may
affect the implementation of the recommendations of the CPG.
5.1
Facilitating and Limiting Factors
Existing facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG include:
a) wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare professionals and teaching institutions via
printed and electronic copies
b) continuing professional education on the management of unerupted and/or impacted
third molar teeth for healthcare professionals
c) adequate facilities at primary and secondary care level for diagnosing and treating
unerupted and/or impacted third molar teeth
Existing barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG include:
a) lack of understanding or limited knowledge on the management of unerupted and/or
impacted third molar teeth
b) variation in skills and treatment practices
c) constraints in equipment and facilities
5.2
Potential Resource Implications
To implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:
a) ensure widespread distribution of the CPG in hard and soft copy to healthcare
professionals in primary and secondary healthcare facilities
b) strengthen training of healthcare professionals to ensure knowledge and information is
up to date
Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth
5.3
