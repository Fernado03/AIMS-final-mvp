STATEMENT OF INTENT
‘These guidelines update and supplant the original guidelines developed
In 2005 and are based on the Best available contemporary evidence,
They are intended as a guide for the best clinical practice in the
management of chronic periodontis presently, However, it must be
noted that adherence to these guidelines do not necessaiy lead to the
best clinical outcome in individual patent care, as every health care
provider is responsibie for the management of his/her unique patient
based on the einieal presentation and management options available
locally.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES
These guidelines were issued in 2012 and wil be reviewed in 2016 or
eater if important new evidence becomes available,

(GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
‘The Development Group for these Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG)
‘consisted of Periodontists, Dental Public Health Specialists and general
nts. The Review Committee was actively involvedin the development
process of these guidelines.
“The previous elton ofthe CPG on Management of Chronic Periodontitis
(2005) was used asthe bass forthe development ofthese guidelines.
‘The recommendations were adapted taking into consideration local
practices.
‘Several improvements have been introduced inthis edition. In adtion to
the genera text and photographic updates, new and updated information|
has been included in the management such as basic periodontal
‘examination, periodontal risk assessment, use of antimicrobials, key
‘messages and recommendations. Besides this, nical aust indicators
have also been identied fr the purpose of monitoring and evaluating
‘outcomes.
Evidences were retrieved from publications from year January 2004
to January 2011. Literature search was caried out using the folowing
electronic. databases: PUBMEDIMEDLINE; Cochrane Database of
‘Systemic Reviews (COSA); IS! Web of Knowledge; Heath Technology
“Assessment (HTA) and fll text journal ates va OVID search engin.
In adattion, the reference lists of all relevant articles retieved were
‘searched to Identity futher studies. The folowing tee text terms oF
MeSH terms were used ether singly or in combination to retrieve the
articles: “Periodontal Screening”, “Periodontal screening index”, “Basic
Periodontal Examination’, "Periodontal soreening and recording”, “OF
Hygiene", “Prevention, "Smoking", "Diabetes Melitus", “Nutrition
“Periodontal Risk Assessment”, “Periodontal Risk Management
“Periodontal sugery", “Periodontal Scaling Root Pianing’,
“Debridement Chronic Periodontitis",
“Laser Chronic Periodontitis Treatment”,
Chronic Periodontitis", "Ultrasonic Scaler, Photodynamic Therapy”,
“Extraction”, “Dental implants, *Rehabiitaion of periodontal patents
‘and "Supportive Periodontal Therapy”. Only literatures in English were
retrieved
‘There were ten clinical questions which were assigned to members
ff the development group. The group members met @ total of 10
times throughout the development of this guideline. Al iteratures
retrieved were appraised by at least two members and presented in
the form of evidence tables and discussed curing group meetings.
All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon
by both the development group and review committee. These CPGs
‘are based largely on the findings of randomized controlled tials
‘and adapted according to local practices. However, where there
‘was lack of evidence, recommendations were based on consensus
‘of group memibers. Although, ideally patients view and preferences:
need to be considered in the development of CPGs, in this instance,
it was not feasible. Nevertheless, patient information leafets would
bbe developed to facilitate the dissemination of important information
to the publ.
‘The levels of evidence ofthe Iterature were graded using the modified
‘version ftom the United States (U.S) /Canaclan Preventive Services Task
Force, while the gracing of recommendations was based onthe modified
version of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)
“The drat guidelines were reviewed by a team of extemal reviewers and
‘were also posted on the Ministry of Health, Malaysia and Academy
fof Medicine, Malaysia websites for comments and feedbacks. These
‘uidelines were presented to the Technical Advisory Commitee for
(CPGs, and finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministy of Health,
Malaysia for approval
‘OBJECTIVES
“To provide evidence-based guidance in the management of chronic
periodontitis.
‘SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
1. To disseminate and reinforce knowledge on the management of
‘chronic periodontitis among healthcare professionals.
1 To provide timely and appropriate management of chronic
periodontitis by healthcare professionals.
CLINICAL QUESTIONS
‘The clinical questions addressed by these guidelines are:
|. How can chronic periodontitis be prevented?
|, How is screening of chronic periodontitis carried out?
Wi, How is chronic periodontitis diagnosed?
|v. Why is Periodontal Risk Assessment necessary?
. How can patients with chronic periodontiis be managed nonsurgically?
‘i, When s periodontal surgery indicated?
vil. When wil antimicrobials agents be needed in periodontal therapy?
vilWhen is extraction indicated?
|x. Can dental implants. be placed in periodontaly compromised
patients?
x. What is Supportive Periodontal Therapy?
‘TARGET POPULATION
‘These guidelines are applicable to patients diagnosed with chronic
periodontitis.
‘TARGET GROUP/USER
‘This guideline is meant forall oral healthcare provers who provide
Clinical management of chronic periodontitis.
HEALTHCARE SETTINGS
Primary and Specialist Oral Healthcare settings.
‘ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS AND COST IMPLICATIONS
Recognition of periodontal heath and disease by a person, the
knowledge of whet to do winen a problem occurs, and the appropriate
response trom the health professional are major factors in prevention
‘and control of chronic periodonttis. This professional awareness is
Influenced by factors such as maintaining an up-to-date understanding
(ofthe nature of periodontal diseases, the routine use of appropriate
‘Screening and examination techniques, factors influencing assessment
‘of treatment needs, patient records, continuing professional education
‘and an understancing of patient expectation.
‘A national oral health survey on 2000 (10,691 Malaysian adults
(15-654year) by the Ministry of Health Malaysia using the
‘Community Periadontal Index of Treatment Needs. (CPITN) found
‘that 00.296 of dentate Malaysian subjects presented with periodontal
‘conditions. Of these subjects, 5.5% had deep pockets of 6 mm
As the outcomes of periodontal therapy is. mostly dependent on
‘the timely and appropriate management of the condition, it is
Important to disseminate the knowledge among healthcare providers,
‘8 well as to lay people, in order to bridge the gap. This can be
faciltated through the development of appropiate traning modules
and quick references.
CCostimplcations on management of chronic periodontitis vary depending
‘on several factors, such as patient's age, patient's expectation, patients
‘compliance and severity of the disease. Successful treatment would
require meticulous periodontal therapy and long tem supporive
therapy; thus affecting the cost involved, Severe periodontal diseases
‘also often result in loss of teeth requiring complex rehabilitation often
Involving dental implants. Early detection of the disease and appropxiate
risk assessment during treatment would enable long term maintenance

1. INTRODUCTION
Chronic periodontitis has been described as inflammation of the
Peviodontium with slow to maderate progressive loss of the tooth

‘commensal flora and the defence mechanisms of the host. When
‘these microorganisms accumulate in the dental biofilms it resuits in

cision making and treatment planning for Supportive Periodontal
Therapy." Various mut-factorial risk assessment models and
tools have been proposed to ideniy low, moderate and high risk for
isease progression of a patient "=" The Lang and Tonetti model
has been assessed for ther effectiveness in predicting future loss of
attachment and tooth loss during Supportive Periodontal therapy.
‘Se inch is based on the folowing parameters: leeding on probing,
umber of sites with probing pocket depth (PPO) > 5mm, bone loss,
tooth loss, systemic factor and environmental factors (s6e appendix 4
for coding system),
62 Non-Surgical Therapy
Non-surgical therapy remains an essential component of a successful
Periodontal treatment." The goal of therapy is to establish and
‘maintain healthy periodontal tissues by removing itants trom the
surface and root ofthe tooth that promote plaque retention, through
‘mechanical means (scaling and root planingiroot debridement). The
reduction of pockets and improving level of attachment are better
‘achieved in moderate to deep periodontal pockets after scaling and root

by clinicians in order to avoid intra-oral transmission of periodontal
pathogens fom periodontal pockets to recently instrumented and
