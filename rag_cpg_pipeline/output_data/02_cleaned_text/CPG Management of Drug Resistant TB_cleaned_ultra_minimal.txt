STATEMENT OF INTENT
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are meant to be guides for clinical practice, based on
the best available evidence at the time of development. Adherence to these guidelines may not
necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider use his/her
own clinical judgment of unique patient based on the clinical picture presented by the patient
and the management options available locally.
UPDATE
These guidelines were issued in 2016 and will be reviewed in 2020 or sooner if new evidence
becomes available. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of
the related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for a
revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the
latest systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.
Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of
publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections will be published in the
web version of this document, which is the definitive version at all times. This version can be

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The members of the Development Group (DG) for this Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) were
from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Education. There was active involvement of a
multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.
A total of 14 clinical questions of the CPG were developed under different sections. Members of
the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer to Appendix 1 for Clinical
Questions). The CPG was adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines only as it
is mostly well-accepted guidelines, namely:
Guidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, emergency
update 2008
Guidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2011
update
Definitions and reporting framework for tuberculosis, - 2013 revision
Companion handbook to the WHO guidelines for the programmatic management of
drug-resistant tuberculosis (2014)
WHO treatment guidelines for drug-resistant tuberculosis- 2016 update
The adaptation process followed the Manual on Adaptation of Evidence Based Clinical Practice
Guidelines of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (which was adapted from ADAPTE Resource
Toolkit for Guideline Adaptation). Assessment of the WHO Guidelines showed that the quality
[using Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool], currency, content,
consistency and applicability of the documents justified them to be adapted for local use.
The CPG DG had decided that no literature search was required in the adaptation process
because the evidence use is sufficient enough for management of DR-TB cases in the country.
All statements and recommendations were modified and formulated (when necessary) with local
practices taken into consideration. They were agreed upon by both the DG and RC.
On completion, the draft CPG was sent for review by WHO (author of the CPGs that being
adapted) and external reviewers. It was also posted on the MOH Malaysia official website for
feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory
Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MOH Malaysia for final review and
approval.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the mid of the twentieth century, tuberculosis (TB) was thought to have been beaten.
However, this disease is now back with a vengeance and drug resistant forms are
increasing to almost an epidemic proportion in certain parts of the world. The burden of
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing both globally and locally. WHO
estimated about 480,000 people develop MDR-TB worldwide in 20131. The number of
people diagnosed with MDR-TB tripled between 2009 and 2013, and reached 136,000
worldwide. In Malaysia, there were 101 cases of MDR-TB reported in 2015 (refer to Fig.
1)2. The globalisation of the recent century has made the spread of diseases more rapid
with massive migrations.
Fig. 1: Cases of MDR-TB, Malaysia (2004-2015)
Though MDR-TB has multifactorial causes, the main reason for the emergence of this scourge
is improper treatment. This may be caused by non-compliance, poor treatment regimes, poor
quality of drugs or concomitant medical diseases. Besides the toll on the health of individuals
suffering from MDR-TB, the cost is also devastating economically. Estimated direct cost of the
drug to treat one MDR-TB patient is RM 15,000.00 compared to RM250.00 for treatment of one
drug susceptible TB patient. Currently, it is not just MDR-TB but extensively drug-resistant TB
(XDR-TB) has emerged to further complicate the management of drug-resistant TB.
We are currently in urgent need to have guidelines locally to help guide and standardise
management of DR-TB which include diagnosis, treatment, prevention and surveillance among
healthcare providers in Malaysia. It was decided to adapt the World Health Organization (WHO)
guidelines on the Programmatic Management of DR-TB which involves documents published in
2008, 2011, 2013, 2014 and the latest 2016 update in the development of the guidelines. The
2016 update introduces the concept of shorter MDR-TB treatment regime between 9-12 months
for newly diagnosed patients. Besides improving compliance, it would also significantly reduce
the cost of treating MDR-TB (refer appendix 2). These guidelines, the first in the country for the
management of DR-TB, definitely are helpful to the healthcare providers in managing the
medical condition more effectively and successfully.

2. PREVENTION OF DRUG-RESISTANT TB
The best way to treat MDR-TB is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Doctors need to
be familiar with causes of DR-TB and the two different pathways leading to formation of DR-TB,
only then we can come up with interventions to interrupt this causation.
2.1 Causes of drug-resistant TB
2.1.1 Two pathways leading to drug-resistant TB
Drug-resistant TB has two developmental pathways that are interconnected with multiple factors
(refer to Fig. 2).
Note: Pathways to development of drug-resistant TB. Arrows represent progression along the two
pathways. Numbers represent factors that can contribute to the prevention of progression.
Fig. 2: Two pathways leading to drug-resistant TB
a. Acquired Drug Resistance
This pathway can be caused by inadequacies from all three components, the healthcare
providers giving inappropriate treatment, inadequate or poor quality of drugs and the
commonest cause, inadequate drug intake by patients (refer to Table 1).

3. FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF DR-TB
The Tuberculosis Control Programme consists of five essential components of a framework that
embodied the whole management aspect of TB. It is tailored according to local situation and
integrated into Direct Observe Treatment Short-course (DOTS) based National Tuberculosis
Programme (NTP).
3.1 DOTS framework as applied to the management of DR-TB
The DOTS strategy is applicable to the whole TB control including DR-TB, as the principles are
the same.
3.1.1 Sustained political commitment
Political commitment is important in fostering national and international partnerships which
should be linked to long-term strategic action plans prepared by NTPs. Long term investment
and leadership run parallel in order to ensure an appropriate integration of DR-TB management
into NTP. Appropriate integration refers to:
• securing adequate infrastructure,
• development and retention of human resources,
• interagency cooperation,
• enactment of necessary legislation,
• TB control policies enabling implementation of the programme
•
facilitation of the procurement of quality-assured second-line drugs and equipment for
diagnostic purposes
Effective TB control strategy and implementation can only takes place with a clear and
sustained political commitment.
3.1.2 Rational case-finding strategy; accentuating on the importance of timely diagnosis
through quality-assured culture, molecular testings and Drug Susceptibility Test
(DST)
TB control largely depends on timely and correct diagnosis. Quality assurance and proficiency
testing with a recognised reference laboratory such as one of the WHO-recognized National
Reference Laboratory must be in place. Ideally, one culture/ DST centre is in place for every five
million populations (1: 5,000,000). Unreliable laboratory results due to non-viable cultures,
contamination, clerical or administrative error will give impact to NTP.
Recommendation 1
•
All tuberculosis patients should have universal access to diagnostic test specifically
Culture and Drug Susceptibility Test.
3.1.3 Case management (case holding) by appropriate treatment strategies with secondline drugs
An excellent DR-TB treatment centre delivers an optimal treatment regimen, in a patientcentered approach concept which includes DOT and monitoring of drug adverse reactions. To
have this in place requires dedicated and committed expertise to consider several factors:
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
5
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
5
•
Implementation of an appropriate substantial infection control
•
A well-defined drug resistance surveillance (DRS) data
•
Proper patient’s documentation including TB drug history
•
Structured procurement of second-line drug and flow of drug monitoring to end user
•
Availability of DST to first- and selected second-line drugs
•
Reliable options for delivering DOT consistently
•
Addressing patients co-infected with HIV and diabetes
Standardized regimen for specific group of patients should be decided by DR-TB experts. MDRTB patients may be given options between hospitalization and ambulatory treatment. However,
health personnel need to look into several factors best suiting the severity of the disease, social
aspect of the patients needs and preferred options of care. Ambulatory would be best if there is
existing social support network available to facilitate adherence at the same time trained
personnel to supervise DOT and identify adverse drug reactions.
3.1.4 Uninterrupted supply of quality-assured anti-TB drugs
In management of MDR/XDR-TB, treatment regimens are frequently changed due to drug
adverse reaction, delayed DST result with poor response to treatment. This creates more
complexity in second-line drugs management on top of its existing short shelf-life, limited global
production and its high price. In order to ensure uninterrupted supply of second-line drug, the
process of procurement must begin at least 6 months or more prior to anticipated need and it
must be estimated accordingly to avoid wastage. It is important to ensure quality assured drug
is used, recognized by WHO or that meet WHO GMP standards.
3.1.5 Standardised recording and reporting system
A complete recording system need to be specifically structured under the DR-TB control
program. This is because it differs by categories and in cooperate a wide array of laboratory
results consisting of culture and DST for first-line and second-line drugs. Its case monitoring is
lengthy; with treatment delivery and response that can reach 24 months. Its cohort analysis
includes interim indicators and the treatment outcome is only reached after two years or more.
The registry and recording must follow the latest case definition by the WHO entitled Definitions
and Reporting Framework for tuberculosis – 2013 revision with National adaptation is required.
A good, specific recording; design for MDR/XDR-TB is essential for evaluating program
performance and treatment effectiveness.
3.2 A plan for tailored integration of management of DR-TB into national programme
It is challenging to implement an integrated DR-TB management into the NTP. The integration
needs full commitment from top down and bottom up in order to secure a sound, apprehensible
and holistic approach covering advocacy, detection, treatment and patient’s welfare. It should
never be underestimated. It is undeniably that the process of integration is complex however
there are many ways to ensure its implementation. It can be facilitated including through public
private mix (PPM) approaches.
Assessment is an essential component of the integration process whereby it will facilitate the
design and implementation plan to meet the gaps identified, in terms of both infrastructure and
functioning of the health-care system. Quality-assured laboratories for diagnosis and monitoring
of treatment response, delivery of DOT and use of quality-assured second-line drug should be
met under all conditions to ensure proper case management and prevent the emergence of
resistance to second-line drugs.

4. DEFINITIONS OF CASE REGISTRATION AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES
Case definitions, patient registration categories and treatment outcome definitions are important
in management of patients infected with drug-resistant TB strains who require second-line antiTB medication.
4.1 Definitions of drug-resistance cases
Different patterns of drug resistance carry different implications for treatment and management.
For the purposes of monitoring, drug-resistant cases are classified in categories based on DST
in clinical isolates confirmed to be M. Tuberculosis (note, the categories are NOT mutually
exclusive):
•
Mono-resistance: resistance to one first-line anti-TB drug only.
•
Poly-resistance: resistance to more than one first-line anti-TB drug, other than both
isoniazid and rifampicin.
•
Multidrug resistance (MDR): resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampicin.
•
Extensive drug resistance (XDR): resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and at least one of
three second-line injectable drugs (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin), in addition to
multidrug resistance.
•
Rifampicin resistance (RR): resistance to rifampicin detected using phenotypic or
genotypic methods, with or without resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It includes any
resistance to rifampicin, in the form of mono-resistance, poly-resistance, MDR or XDR.
Patients placed on second-line anti-TB medications usually belong to one of the following
groups:
•
Confirmed RR-TB or MDR-TB.
•
Presumptive RR-TB or MDR-TB. Patients may be registered and started on second-line
anti-TB treatment on the basis of significant risk for drug resistance and before laboratory
confirmation of resistance, or on the basis of a rapid molecular result.
•
Poly-/mono-resistant TB without rifampicin resistance. Some of these cases may have
second-line anti-TB drugs added to their treatment.
•
XDR-TB (confirmed or presumptive). Patients may be started on XDR-TB treatment on
the basis of a laboratory diagnosis or, in its absence, because of significant risk.
4.2 Patient registration categories
Patients are assigned to a registration group based on the most recent treatment history at the
time of collecting the biological specimen that was used to confirm MDR-TB or RR-TB.spacing
•
New. A patient who has received no or less than one month of anti-TB treatment. For the
purposes of registration on second-line treatment for MDR-TB, patients are considered New
if DST was performed within one month of the start of treatment, even if they had received
more than one month of first-line drug treatment for TB by the time that the DST results
returned and they were registered for second-line TB treatment
•
Relapse. A patient who was previously treated for TB and whose most recent treatment
outcome was Cured or Treatment completed, and who is subsequently diagnosed with a
recurrent episode of TB (either a true relapse or a new episode of TB caused by reinfection).
•
Treatment after loss to follow-up. A patient who had previously been treated for TB and
was declared Lost to follow-up at the end of the most recent course of treatment.
•
After failure of first treatment with first-line drugs. A patient who has received first-line
drug treatment for TB and in whom treatment has failed.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
8
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
8
•
After failure of retreatment regimen with first-line drugs. A previously treated TB patient
who has received a retreatment regimen with first-line drugs and in whom the retreatment
has failed.
•
After failure of treatment with second-line drugs. A previously treated DR-TB patient
who has received full MDRTB treatment regimen.
•
Other previously treated patients. A previously treated TB patient whose outcome after
the most recent course of treatment is unknown or undocumented.
•
Patients with unknown previous TB treatment history do not fit into any of the groups
listed above.
4.3 Treatment outcomes
Definitions of treatment outcomes for drug-resistant patients are shown in the following table 3.
Table 3: Treatment outcome definition
a For Treatment failed, lack of conversion by the end of the intensive phase implies that the patient does not convert
within the maximum duration of the intensive phase applied by the programme. If no maximum duration is defined, an
8-month cut-off is proposed. For regimens without a clear distinction between intensive and continuation phases, a
cut-off eight months after the start of treatment is suggested to determine when the criteria for Cured, Treatment
completed and Treatment failed start to apply.
b The terms “conversion” and “reversion” of culture as used here are defined as follows:
Conversion (to negative): culture is considered to have converted to negative when two consecutive cultures, taken
at least 30 days apart, are found to be negative. In such a case, the specimen collection date of the first negative
culture is used as the date of conversion.
Reversion (to positive): culture is considered to have reverted to positive when, after an initial conversion, two
consecutive cultures, taken at least 30 days apart, are found to be positive. For the purpose of defining Treatment
failure, reversion is considered only when it occurs in the continuation phase
Cured
Treatment completed as recommended by the national policy without
evidence of failure AND three or more consecutive cultures taken at least
30 days apart are negative after the intensive phasea
Treatment
completed
Treatment completed as recommended by the national policy without
evidence of failure BUT no record that three or more consecutive cultures
taken at least 30 days apart are negative after the intensive phasea
Treatment
failed
Treatment terminated or need for permanent regimen change of at least
two anti-TB drugs because of:
•
Lack of conversionb by the end of the intensive phasea; or
•
Bacteriological reversionb in the continuation phase after conversionb to
negative; or
•
Evidence of additional acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones or
second-line injectable drugs; or
•
Adverse drug reactions.
Died
A patient who dies for any reason during the course of treatment.
Lost to
follow-up
A patient whose treatment was interrupted for two consecutive months or
more.
Not
evaluated
A patient for whom no treatment outcome is assigned. (This includes cases
“transferred out” to another treatment unit and whose treatment outcome is
unknown).
Treatment
success
The sum of Cured and Treatment completed.

5. CASE FINDING STRATEGIES
The choice of approaches for case finding and enrolment in drug-resistant TB control
programmes strive to identify patients and initiate adequate treatment for drug resistant cases in
a timely manner. This prevents the patients from spreading the disease and acquiring further
resistance and progressing to permanent lung damage. Case finding for drug-resistant TB
refers to the process of:
•
identifying individuals who may have drug-resistant TB;
•
evaluating them appropriately;
•
diagnosing drug-resistant TB;
•
recording and reporting any drug-resistant TB diagnosed according to standardized criteria
5.1 Risk factors for DR-TB
Risk factors for DR-TB are shown in Table 4.
Table 4: Risk factor for DR-TB
Risk factors for DR-TB
Risk group
Failure of retreatment regimens
with first line anti-TB drugs
(SHREZ), (previously known as
chronic TB cases)
Patients who are still sputum smear-positive at the
end of a retreatment regimen have perhaps the
highest
MDR-TB
rates
in
any
group,
often
approaching 90%.
Failure of new TB regimens
(HREZ)
Patients who, while on treatment, are sputum smearpositive at month five or later during the course of
treatment. Not all patients in whom a regimen fails
have drug-resistant TB, and the percentage may
depend on a number of factors, including whether
rifampicin was used in the continuation phase and
whether
directly
observed
therapy
was
used
throughout treatment.
Exposure to a known drug
resistant TB case
Most studies have shown that close contacts of MDRTB patients have very high rates of MDR-TB.
Failure of anti-TB treatment in
the private sector
Anti-TB regimens from the private sector can vary
greatly. A detailed history of drugs used is essential. If
both isoniazid and rifampicin were used, the chances
of MDR-TB may be high. Sometimes second-line antiTB drugs may have been used, and this is important
information for designing the retreatment regimen.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
10
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
10
Patients who remain sputum
smear-positive at the end of two
months of a first-line anti-TB drug
regimen
Many programmes may choose to perform culture
and DST on patients who remain sputum smearpositive at month two. This group of patients are at
risk for DR-TB.
Relapse and return after loss to
follow-up, without recent treatment
failure
Evidence suggests that most relapse cases and those
that return after loss to follow-up (without recent
treatment failure) do not have drug-resistant TB.
However, certain patient histories may point more
strongly to possible drug-resistant TB; for example,
erratic drug use or early relapses.
Exposure in institutions that have
drug-resistant TB outbreaks or a
high drug-resistant TB prevalence
Patients who frequent homeless shelters, prisoners
and health-care workers in clinics, laboratories and
hospitals can have high rates of drug-resistant TB
Residence in areas with high
drug-resistant TB prevalence
Drug-resistant TB rates in many areas of the world
can be high enough to justify routine DST in all new
cases.
History of using anti-TB drugs
of poor or unknown quality
The percentage of drug-resistant TB caused by use of
poor quality drugs is unknown but considered
significant. All drugs should comply with acceptable
international quality assurance standards.
Comorbid conditions associated
with malabsorption or rapid-transit
diarrhoea
Malabsorption may result in selective low serum drug
levels and may occur in either HIV-negative or HIVpositive patients.
HIV
An association between HIV and MDR-TB has been
recorded in some parts of the world, and numerous
drug-resistant TB outbreaks have been documented
in HIV positive patients. It is strongly recommended
that all individuals with HIV-associated TB have DST
to rule out drug-resistant TB and to avoid high rates of
mortality due to unrecognized drug-resistant TB in
these patients.
S=streptomycin; H=isoniazid; R=rifampicin; E=ethambutol; Z=pyrazinamide.
5.2 Diagnosing XDR-TB
The two strongest risk factors for XDR-TB are:
i.
failure of an MDR-TB treatment regimen, which contains second-line drugs including an
injectable agent and a fluoroquinolone; and
ii.
close contact with an individual with documented XDR-TB or with an individual for whom
treatment with a regimen including second-line drugs is failing or has failed.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
11
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
11
All patients diagnosed with MDR-TB should preferably be tested for XDR-TB.
5.3 DR-TB case finding in paediatric patients
The best strategy for detection of drug-resistant TB, and the WHO recommended strategy, is to
use rapid DST. The WHO 2011 update of Guidelines for the programmatic management of
drug-resistant tuberculosis, specifically states: Rapid DST of isoniazid and rifampicin or of
rifampicin alone is recommended over conventional testing at the time of diagnosis of TB,
subject to available resources. However, this is based on very low quality evidence.
Paediatric cases require adjustments in diagnostic criteria. Most young children will not be able
to produce adequate sputum specimens upon request. Sputum induction with nebulised
hypertonic saline may facilitate collection of tracheobronchial secretions, especially in children
who have a dry cough or no cough. Gastric lavage on an empty stomach is the other option for
collecting specimens for Xpert MTB/RIF and culture and DST.

6. LABORATORY ASPECTS
Definitive diagnosis of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) requires that Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(MTB) bacteria to be detected and determined its resistance to anti-TB drugs. This chapter
describes standards for laboratory services needed to diagnose and treat drug-resistant TB in
the context of existing laboratory capacity.
Laboratory detection of DR-TB consist of;
• identification of the isolate as belonging to the MTB complex.
• drug susceptibility testing (DST)
• WHO-endorsed molecular test to detect TB DNA and mutations associated with
resistance
6.1 Essential laboratory services and infrastructure
Culture isolation method is essential for monitoring DR-TB patients’ response to therapy.
Minimum requirement in DR-TB programme also includes the capacity to reliably identify M.
tuberculosis and detect resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid.
The roles of laboratory in DR-TB are;
• diagnostic and clinical services
• surveillance of drug resistance patterns; for providing information on the degree and
trends in drug resistance, for developing appropriate treatment modalities, and for
evaluating the impact of control program interventions.
Quality Management System (QMS) is necessary for the laboratory to be implemented to
ensure that all aspects of laboratory diagnostic services are performed properly and allow for
the detection of any laboratory errors. QMS is necessary to ensure accurate detection of drug
resistance and also to avoid false diagnoses. In addition, documented first-line DST proficiency,
preferably by the reference laboratory, is strongly recommended for drug-resistant TB control
programmes.
Quality Management System should include;
• standard operating procedures (SOPs)
• internal quality control
• external quality assessment
Establishing and maintaining laboratory networks is challenging, difficult and costly. Adequate
human and financial resource allocation is therefore crucial to ensure the availability of qualified
and trained laboratory staff and for the functioning of the laboratory infrastructure with
appropriate level of biosafety, well-maintained equipment and sufficient consumables.
6.2 Organisation of the TB laboratory network
TB laboratory networks have a pyramidal structure with peripheral laboratories (health clinics/
smear microscopy centre) accessible to all presumptive/known TB patients, intermediate
laboratories (culture centres/ID and DST centres) and a single/central laboratory (National TB
Reference Laboratory). Different levels of biosafety precautions are needed depending on the
type of test being performed and the risk of generation of infectious aerosol, with the most
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)

hazardous procedure are involving the manipulation of positive cultures for identification and
performing DST. Supranational laboratory is recognised to strengthen and support the national
reference laboratory. To strengthen and support the national reference laboratory, Queensland
Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory has been recognised as the SRL for Malaysia.
6.3 Specimen collection and transport of infectious substances
Good quality specimens especially sputum are essential for proper TB laboratory diagnosis.
Therefore, specific measures must be taken to minimise exposure during sputum collection as
coughing produces potentially infectious aerosols.
Patient must also be given effective instructions from a trained staff on collecting samples.
Adequate material such as using wide-mouthed containers that are sterile, clear and leak-proof
(with screw caps) and procedures must also be available. The specimen containers should be
promptly transported to the laboratory using appropriate packaging for safe transport of
infectious materials.
Specimen containers should be promptly transported to the laboratory using appropriate
packaging for safe transport of infectious materials, surrounded by absorbent material,
protected by a secondary packaging and then placed in a shock-resistant outer packaging
labelled according to national and international regulations for the transport of infectious
materials.
Recommendation 2
•
Specimens should be collected in open air, well-ventilated areas, where infectious
droplets are rapidly diluted and ultra violet rays can inactivate tuberculosis bacilli to
reduce risk of transmission.
•
Specimens should be submitted to the laboratory and processed for culture within 24
hours from collection. Delayed specimens should be kept refrigerated at 4°C and
transported to the laboratory in cold chain.
•
Specimen containers should be transported to the laboratory using appropriate
packaging for safe transport of infectious materials.
6.4 Mycobacteriology laboratory services for drug-resistant TB programmes
6.4.1 Microscopy
Smear microscopy is the front-line tool for TB (but not for DR-TB) diagnosis. The main purposes
of microscopy for drug-resistant TB are:
•
to assess initial bacterial load, specimen triage to different diagnostic algorithms,
•
monitor response to therapy,
•
in the TB culture centres: to confirm the presence of AFB rather than contaminants in the
culture media, before proceeding to rapid identification tests.
Light emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy is recommended to increase the test
sensitivity and to reduce the turnaround time required allowing the screening of a larger number
of slides at the peripheral level
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
14
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
14
6.4.2 Xpert MTB/RIF
Xpert MTB/RIF assay, is a cartridge-based fully automated molecular diagnostic assay that can
identify MTB complex DNA and the mutations associated with rifampicin resistance directly from
sputum specimens, in less than two hours. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay has similar sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy as culture on solid media and has been recommended by WHO as the
initial diagnostic test among people at risk of MDR-TB. Therefore, Xpert MTB/RIF should be
implemented to increase and expand access to accurate TB diagnosis (5). Figure 3 shows
using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay as the initial diagnostic test for TB followed by culture and DST.
Indication of using Xpert MTB/RIF as initial diagnostic test is listed in Appendix 3.
Recommendation 3
•
Xpert MTB/RIF should be used in addition to conventional microscopy, culture and DST
as the initial diagnostic test in adults and children suspected of having MDR-TB or HIVassociated TB. It may be used as a follow-on test to microscopy in adults and children
clinically suspicious of TB where MDR-TB and HIV is of lesser concern, especially in
further testing of smear-negative specimens where resources are available.
Xpert MTB/RIF assay cannot be used as a replacement for smear and culture isolation for
monitoring the response of DR-TB patients to therapy
6.4.3 Line probe assay
Line probe assay (LPA) allows rapid detection of resistance to rifampicin (alone or in
combination with isoniazid). LPAs are suitable for use at the central or national reference
laboratory level, with potential for decentralization to regional level if the appropriate
infrastructure can be ensured.
For patients with confirmed rifampicin-resistant TB or MDR-TB, SL-LPA may be used as the
initial test to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs. This
recommendation applies to the use of SL-LPA for testing sputum specimens (direct testing) and
cultured isolates of M. tuberculosis complex (indirect testing) from both pulmonary and
extrapulmonary sites.
6.4.4 Culture of MTB
Culture in liquid media is the current reference method for bacteriological confirmation of TB.
However, good quality specimens, prompt transport to the laboratory and quality of laboratory
processing (appropriate digestion and decontamination, as well as good quality culture media
and incubation conditions) are critical to optimize the yield of culture. Laboratory errors, may
lead to false-negative or false-positive results. Therefore, laboratory findings should always be
correlated with the patient’s clinical condition and any diagnostic test should be repeated if
necessary.
The recovery of tubercle bacilli is higher and the time to detection is shorter with liquid
culture compared to solid culture methods. However, as it is more sensitive, it has higher
contamination rates than solid media.

6.4.5 Identification of MTB
All mycobacterial isolates from solid or liquid cultures must be identified to allow differentiation
of the M. tuberculosis complex from NTM prior to DST. Several ways can be used such as
phenotypic tests, immunochromatographic assay (ICA) or genotypic assay. At a minimum,
laboratories supporting DR-TB control programmes should be able to conduct identification
tests for M. tuberculosis complex that follow international guidelines.
6.4.6 Drug susceptibility testing (DST)
DST plays an important role in most strategies to identify and treat patients with, or at high risk
of DR-TB.
•
Phenotypic DST (Conventional DST)
Phenotypic DST involves culturing of M. tuberculosis bacteria in the presence of anti-TB drugs
to detect inhibition of growth. It allows the detection of drug resistance regardless of the
mechanism or molecular basis and can be performed as direct or indirect tests on solid media
or in liquid media. The most commonly used methods for solid media are the proportion,
absolute concentration, and resistance ratio methods; and for liquid culture systems is the
proportion method.
For second-line DST, broth or liquid methods and the proportion method on solid medium give
similar results5. The absolute concentration and resistance ratio methods for second-line DST
have not been validated, and neither have any of the non-commercial methods. The current
status of DST methods, consensus on reliability and reproducibility, and critical concentrations
for different methods for second-line DST is given in Table 5.

•
Genotypic DST
Molecular LPA and the Xpert MTB/RIF are currently the only two molecular technologies
endorsed by WHO for the genotypic detection of rifampicin resistance.
For patients with confirmed rifampicin-resistant TB or MDR-TB, SL-LPA may be used as the
initial test, instead of phenotypic culture-based DST, to detect resistance to injectable drugs
and floroquinolone if resources are available. Direct testing for smear positive sputum
specimen (1+ and above) and indirect testing of MTB culture for those with low bacteria load
The advantages of rapid rifampicin testing include prompt screening of patients at risk of MDRTB, earlier identification of patients on inappropriate first-line regimens, and allows for early
interruption of MDR-TB transmission.
However, the use of molecular tests for rapid detection of MDR-TB still does not eliminate the
need for conventional culture and DST capability. The recommended algorithm for interpretation
of Genotypic DST results is depicted in figure 4.
•
Limitations of DST
Limitations of DST are;
i.
first-line DST
•
most reliable for rifampicin and isoniazid.
•
less reliable and reproducible for streptomycin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide
(pyrazinamide testing can only be performed on liquid media after appropriate pH
adjustment).
ii. second-line DST
•
has good reliability and reproducibility for second-line injectable drugs (amikacin,
kanamycin, capreomycin) and fluoroquinolones.
•
data on the reproducibility and reliability of DST for the other second-line drugs are
limited, and for several of them methods have not been established or standardized;
in addition, data correlating DST results to the clinical outcome are still insufficient.
6.5 Rational use of DST in DR-TB programmes
Maintaining proficiency in DST requires good laboratory technique and infrastructure, as well as
an adequate workload (numbers of specimens) to be tested. In many settings, this implies
centralization of laboratory services for DST.
WHO policy guidance on DST 2014 (5) is as follows:
•
Laboratory capacity to reliably detect rifampicin resistance and/or MDR-TB through
molecular tests and/or quality-assured DST of isoniazid and rifampicin resistance is a
minimum requirement for drug-resistant-TB programmes.
•
Formal links with one of the laboratories of the SRL network is needed to ensure appropriate
infrastructure for the procedures being performed and proper diagnostic algorithms and
quality assurance mechanisms in place.
•
Strategies for laboratory services in support of drug-resistant TB programmes should follow
a systems approach (refer to figure 5) and take into account the DST limitations outlined
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
19
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
19
above. DST should be focused on those drugs for which reliable and reproducible methods
are available.
•
DST methods for the second-line injectable drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin) and
fluoroquinolones are accurate and reproducible. However, routine DST for second-line
drugs should not be performed unless the required laboratory quality and biosafety
standards are met, infrastructure and capacity have been established, rigorous quality
assurance is in place, and sustainable high proficiency has been demonstrated for isoniazid
and rifampicin testing. In order to retain proficiency and expertise, it is recommended that
second-line DST only be performed if at least 200 specimens are tested per year. As the
National TB Reference Laboratory, only National Public Health Laboratory can perform the
test.
•
At present, routine DST for other core second-line agents and add-on agents (not part of the
core MDR-TB regimen) is not recommended as accuracy and reproducibility of laboratory
testing cannot be guaranteed.
•
Strains should be tested for resistance to the fluoroquinolone(s) used in a programme’s
treatment strategy. Cross-resistance is not complete between older- and newer-generation
fluoroquinolones.

High proficiency in DST to H and R
should be a priority for the correct

done at a central laboratory while fast

6.6 Testing and reporting: turnaround time
To ensure rapid diagnosis of M. tuberculosis and DR-TB, laboratories should define standard
turnaround times, which should be strictly followed. A summary of TB diagnostic methods and

7. TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR MDR-TB AND XDR-TB
It is critical for a country to know the prevalence of drug resistance in new patients and
retreatment cases. As for Malaysia, estimated RR/MDR-TB cases among notified TB pulmonary
cases in Malaysia for new cases was 1.5% and previously treated cases was 3.1% for year
2015. Therefore, access to quality assured DST is valuable and important. Mechanism for
collection of the data and statistic, notification, registration and updating the patient monitoring
and response in the TB information system is very important.
Drug resistance surveillance(DRS) data can also be used as a tool to monitor the frequency of
usage of each second-line anti-TB as some second-line anti-TB drugs may have been used
more frequently than the others. Some will likely be effective in drug-resistant TB treatment
regimens, while others may have been used extensively, and therefore, have a high probability
of ineffectiveness in a large proportion of drug-resistant TB patients.
7.1 Definitions of terms used to describe treatment strategies
The following are definitions of terms often used to describe treatment strategies (refer to table
7);
Table 7: Definition of treatment strategies
Treatment Strategies
Definition
Standardized
treatment
DRS data from representative patient populations are used to
base regimen design in the absence of individual DST. All
patients in a defined group or category receive the same regimen.
Suspected MDR-TB should be confirmed by DST whenever
possible.
Individualized
treatment
Each regimen is designed based on the patient’s past history of
TB treatment and individual DST results.
7.2 Classes of anti-TB drugs
WHO has reclassified the second-line anti-TB drugs based on the available evidence and the
associated level of certainty. It considers the balance between anticipated desirable and
undesirable effects and feasibility of implementation (refer Table 8).

3 Carbapenems and clavulanate are meant to be used together; clavulanate is only available in
formulations combined with amoxicillin
4HIV-status must be tested and confirmed to be negative before thioacetazone is started
Clarithromycin and other macrolides are no longer included among the medicines to be used for
the treatment of MDR-TB. For weight based dosing anti-TB drugs refer to Appendix 4.
7.3 Standard code for TB treatment regimens
There is a standard code for writing TB treatment regimens. Each anti-TB drug has an
abbreviation (refer to Table8).
A drug-resistant TB regimen consists of two phases:
a) First/intensive phase is the period in which the injectable agent is used
b) Second/maintenance phase is after the injectable agent has been stopped.
How to write the regime:
•
The two phases are generally separated by a backslash (/).
•
The number before each phase stands for phase duration in months, and this number is the
minimum amount of time that the stage should last.
•
The number in subscript (e.g. 3) after a letter is the number of drug doses per week. If there
is no number in subscript, treatment is daily (injectables are generally given for 5–6 days per
week).
•
The drugs in the higher groups are written first followed by others in descending group
order.
Eg: 8 Km-Lfx-Eto-Cs-Z / 12 Lfx-Eto-Cs-Z
8 Km5-Lfx-Eto-Cs-Z / 12 Lfx-Eto-Cs-Z
4-6 Km5-Mfx-Pto-Cfz-Z-Hhigh-dose -E / 5 Mfx-Cfz-Z-E.

7.4 Role of DST
DST for some first-line and most second-line anti-TB drugs does not detect with 100% certainty
the sensitivity of a drug. DST for ethambutol, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, Group A, C and D
drugs presents problems with accuracy and reproducibility in most settings. DST to
pyrazinamide is not reliable and for this reason it is considered an acceptable practice to use
pyrazinamide in a regimen even when a laboratory result demonstrates resistance. More
studies need to be done to evaluate pyrazinamide DST in the future. Ethambutol is not routinely
added to conventional MDR regimen, however, it can be used if the criteria of it being a likely
effective drug are met.
The Xpert MTB/RIF assay can be used as initial diagnostic tool for MDR-TB if available.
Malaysia advocate that Xpert MTB/RIF to be used for diagnosis of rifampicin resistance in
adults and children:
a. Xpert MTB/RIF should be used rather than conventional microscopy, culture and DST as
the initial diagnostic test in adults suspected of having MDR-TB or HIV-associated TB
(strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
b. Xpert MTB/RIF should be used rather than conventional microscopy, culture and DST as
the initial diagnostic test in children suspected of having MDR-TB or HIV-associated TB
(strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
7.5 Designing and administrating an MDR regimen
This section describes the methods for designing and administrating an MDR regimen. It applies
to standardised and individualised regimens.
7.5.1 General principles
The following are the basic principles involved in the treatment of MDR-TB;
a. usage of “likely effective” drugs.
Anti-TB drug is considered “likely to be effective” when;
•
the drug has not been used in a regimen that failed to cure the individual patient;
•
DST performed on the patient’s strain indicates that it is susceptible to the drug
•
No known resistance to drugs with high cross-resistance
•
No known close contacts with resistance to the drug
•
Drug resistance surveys demonstrate that resistance is rare to the drug in patients with
similar TB history.
•
In the treatment of patients with MDR-TB, ethionamide (or prothionamide) should be
used provided no contraindication such as a severe adverse effects.
•
More than five drugs can be used depending on the effectiveness of the drugs for
example in XDR-TB.
b. dosage and frequency of the drugs
•
The drug dosage is usually determined by age and weight.
•
All anti-TB drugs can be started at full dose. However, if tolerance is an issue,
cycloserine, ethionamide and PAS dosing can be increased gradually over a two-week
period.
•
Pyrazinamide, ethambutol and fluoroquinolones should be given once a day.
•
Ethionamide/prothionamide, cycloserine and PAS have traditionally been given in split
doses during the day to reduce adverse effects.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
26
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
26
•
Injectable drugs can be given once daily, five to seven days a week. If adverse effects
occur, injectable agent may be given three times a week, preferably only after culture
conversion.
•
Oral drugs are to be given seven days a week under DOT.
•
Pyrazinamide can be used for the entire treatment since many drug-resistant TB
patients have chronically inflammed lungs as Pyrazinamide is more effective in the
acidic environment. In Rifampicin Resistant patients, high-dose isoniazid may be
included in the MDR regimen until DST to isoniazid is available.
c. addressing the Adverse effect
•
To avoid the drugs that is known to have a strong contraindication of usage due to
drug–drug interactions, overlying toxicities, co-morbidities, history of severe allergy or
other adverse reactions and pregnancy.
•
Any adverse effects of drugs that occurs should be managed immediately and
adequately to relief suffering, minimize the risk of treatment interruptions, and prevent
morbidity and mortality due to serious adverse effects.
d. TB-HIV co-morbidity
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients with HIV and drug-resistant TB,
irrespective of CD4 cell-count, as early as possible following initiation of the anti-TB
treatment.

formulations combined with amoxicillin
Conventional Treatment
In patients with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB, a regimen with at least five
effective TB medicines during the intensive phase is recommended, including pyrazinamide
and four core second-line TB medicines - one chosen from group A, one from group B, and
at least two from group C (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence).
If the minimum of effective TB medicines cannot be composed as above, an agent from
group D2 and other agents from D3 may be added to bring the total to five.
In patients with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB, it is recommended that the
regimen be further strengthened with high-dose isoniazid and/or ethambutol
However, WHO suggested for a new shorter MDRTB regimen:
Standardized shorter MDR-TB regimen with seven drugs and treatment duration of 9 months.
The Shorter MDRTB regimen may be extended to 6 months of intensive phase, in case of lack
of sputum conversion, with total duration of treatment of 12 months.

29
Monitoring for effectiveness, harms and relapse will be needed. Patient-centred care and social
support will be essential to enable patient adherence. Programmatic use is feasible in most
settings.
Patients on Shorter MDRTB regimen are advice to convert to conventional TB treatment when:
•
Lack of response to treatment (e.g. no sputum smear conversion by 6 months or
deterioration of clinical condition despite treatment);
•
Patient is treated for more than one month, interrupts treatment and returns after an
interval >2 months (i.e. fulfils another exclusion criterion);
•
Emergence of another exclusion criterion (e.g. EP-TB disease, pregnancy, intolerance to
a medicine in the regimen) etc.
Recommendation 4
•
In patients with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB, a regimen with at least five
effective TB medicines during the intensive phase is recommended, including
pyrazinamide and four core second-line TB medicines - one chosen from group A, one
from group B, and at least two from group C. If the minimum of effective TB medicines
cannot be composed as above, an agent from group D2 and other agents from D3 may
be added to bring the total to five.
•
In patients with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB, it is recommended that the
regimen be further strengthened with high-dose isoniazid and/or ethambutol.
•
In patients with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB who have not been
previously treated with second-line drugs and in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones
and second-line injectable agents has been excluded or is considered highly unlikely, a
shorter MDR-TB regimen of 9months may be used instead of a conventional regimen
7.6 Duration of second-line anti-TB regimens
The intensive phase is defined as the time MDR-TB patient is on injectable anti-TB drugs.
Recommendation 5
•
In the conventional treatment of patients with MDR-TB, an INTENSIVE PHASE of eight
months is suggested for most patients, and the duration may be modified according to
the patient’s response to therapy.
•
In the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with MDR-TB, TOTAL TREATMENT
duration of 20 months is suggested for most patients, and the duration may be modified
according to the patient’s response to therapy.
•
Shorter MDR-TB regimen duration is 9-12months.
7.7 Extrapulmonary and central nervous system drug-resistant TB
The same strategy and duration to pulmonary drug resistant tuberculosis are applied to
extrapulmonary drug resistant tuberculosis. However, in central nervous system involvement,
the regimen should include drugs with adequate penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (refer
Table 10).

Ethionamide (or prothionamide), cycloserine (or terizidone) and linezolid have good CNS
penetration. CSF penetration is good but variable for levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.
Pyrazinamide has good CNS penetration, although caution should be exercised as a large
percentage of MDR-TB strains may be resistant. Isoniazid penetrates the CNS very well, with
higher doses reaching adequate MICs in the cerebrospinal fluid. Due to its good CNS
penetration, high-dose isoniazid is recommended to be used as part of the treatment regimen
unless high-level resistance is known to exist.
No recommendation is possible at this stage to use the shorter regimen in patients with
extrapulmonary MDR-TB in view of the findings from studies of shorter MDR-TB regimen
were limited to patients with pulmonary disease.
7.8 Surgery in treatment of DR-TB
Surgery in DR-TB is an adjunct to the medical treatment. Resection is done to those patients
with disease localized to a lobe or lung. Large case series analysis has proven resection
surgery to be effective and safe under appropriate surgical conditions. It is considered an
adjunct to chemotherapy and appears to be beneficial for patients when skilled thoracic
surgeons and excellent postoperative care are available.
General indications for resection surgery include
•
Patients that remain smear-positive, with resistance to a large number of drugs
•
Localized pulmonary disease
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
31
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
31
Contraindications for resection surgery are:
•
Very sick patients with co-morbidities
•
Older patients
•
Those with extensive disease
Recommendation preoperative investigations:
•
Computerized tomography
•
Pulmonary function testing
•
Quantitative lung perfusion/ventilation
Timing for surgery is important in such that the patient has the best possible chance of cure with
the least morbidity. It can be done earlier in the course of disease usually after at least 2 months
of medical therapy. This is to decrease the bacterial infection in the surrounding tissue.
Nevertheless, even with successful resection, the intensive phase and total treatment duration
should be guided by the recommendations in Sections 7.8.
Environmental control in specialized surgical facilities should include stringent infection control
measures, given that infectious substance and aerosols are generated in large quantities during
surgery, mechanical ventilation and post-operative pulmonary hygiene manoeuvres.
Recommendation 6
• In patients with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB, elective partial lung
resection (lobectomy or wedge resection) may be used alongside a recommended MDRTB regimen (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence).
7.9 Corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy in drug-resistant TB treatment
The role of adjuvant therapies has not been well established except in specific indications. It
should be given in tapering dose over several weeks.
Corticosteroids can be beneficial in conditions like severe central nervous system or
pericardial involvement.
7.10 Nutritional support
Nutritional support is one of the important factors in the management of DR-TB as TB itself
causes malnutrition and DR-TB exacerbates by poor nutritional status. Furthermore, the
second-line anti-TB can also cause GI disturbance and decrease the appetite making adequate
nutrition a challenge. Therefore, nutritional assessment counselling should be integrated in the
multidisciplinary team throughout the duration of illness. Peripheral neuropathy is a known
neurological side effect of some of second-line anti-TB drugs.
Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) should be given to all MDR-TB patients receiving cycloserine or
terizidone, and a high dosage of isoniazid or linezolid to prevent neurological side effects

7.11 Treatment strategies of XDR-TB
There is very limited data on XDR-TB management. However, there are recent studies and
meta-analysis suggested:
Success in XDR-TB patients was highest if at least six drugs were used in the intensive
phase and four in the continuation phase.
The use of later-generation fluoroquinolone significantly improved treatment outcomes in
patients with XDR-TB, even though DST demonstrated resistance to a representative
fluoroquinolone.
Treatment management for patients with documented or almost certain XDR-TB are as below
(refer Table 11);
Table 11: Treatment management for patients with documented or almost certain XDR-TB
Step 1
Use a higher-generation fluoroquinolone Group A such as moxifloxacin or
gatifloxacin.
Step 2
Use an injectable agent Group B to which the strain is susceptible and consider
an extended duration of use (12 months or possibly the whole treatment). If
resistant to all injectable agents it is recommended to use one the patient has
never used before or consider designing the regimen without an injectable
agent.
Step 3
Use all Group C agents that have not been used extensively in a previous
regimen or any that are likely to be effective
Step 4
Use pyrazinamide and any other Group D1 agent that may be effective.
Step 5
Use Group D2 and D3 agents that have not been used extensively in a
previous regimen or any that are likely to be effective
Generally, XDR-TB patients generally receive at least 24 months of therapy in most. The
duration maybe modified according to patient’s response to treatment

8. MONO-RESISTANT AND POLY- RESISTANT STRAINS
Mono- and poly-resistant TB strains are picked up during case-finding for MDR-TB. DST should
be done in all patients before treatment using a rapid test that detects resistance to isoniazid
and rifampicin.
It is important to address this situation as treating patients who have mono- or poly-resistant
strains using the standardised first-line anti-TB drug regimens has been shown to increase the
risk of treatment failure and further acquired resistance. This may eventually lead to MDR-TB if
it is not properly managed.
8.1 Treatment of patients with mono- and poly-resistant strains
Table 12 shows the various regimens for mono- and poly-resistant strains. There is a lack of
randomized clinical trials to determine the best treatment for these strains. The regimens have
been based on observational cohort studies and the recommendations of expert panels, taking
into account the evolving DST globally. The regimes have been suggested with the underlying
assumption that the pattern of drug resistance has not changed between the initial sputum
collections and initiating the re-design of the anti-TB drug regimen.
In patients with rifampicin-resistant TB, a regimen with at least five effective TB medicines
during the intensive phase is recommended, including pyrazinamide and four core second-line
TB medicines - one chosen from group A, one from group B, and at least two from group C
(conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). If the minimum of effective TB
medicines cannot be composed as above, an agent from group D2 and other agents from D3
may be added to bring the total to five (refer to Table 8, Chapter 7). It is recommended that the
regimen be further strengthened with high-dose isoniazid and/or ethambutol (conditional
recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence).

9. TREATMENT OF DRUG-RESISTANT TB IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND SITUATIONS
Management of DR-TB in certain groups of patient such as pregnancy, renal failure, liver
disease and etc. may require different approach and modification due to the risks of treatment
complications. The benefit and risk of treatment to the patients should be considered before it is
initiated and frequent monitoring may be necessary.
9.1 Pregnancy
DR-TB is seen frequently in young people as well as women of childbearing age. Toxicity of the
drugs used in DR-TB treatment during pregnancy creates anxiety not only for patients but also
for clinicians.
DR-TB and its treatment during pregnancy pose great risk to the mother and fetus however
pregnancy is not a contraindication for treatment of active drug-resistant TB. A decision to
start treatment especially in the first trimester or to postpone should be agreed upon by the
patient and the doctor.
Recommendation 7
• All female patients of child bearing age who are diagnosed DR-TB should be tested for
pregnancy.
• Pregnant patients should be started on treatment as soon as the diagnosis is made.
However, treatment may be delayed until the second trimester if the patient is stable with
minimum disease.
• The treatment regimen should contain three or four second-line anti-TB drugs which are
likely to be effective plus pyrazinamide and reinforced with an injectable agent and other
drugs as needed immediately postpartum.
• Fluoroquinolones, cycloserine, paraaminosalicylic acid (PAS) and amoxicillin/clavulanate)
should be considered as the drug of choice when selecting drugs for MDR-TB treatment.
• Injectable agents should be avoided. However, capreomycin may be considered in life
threatening situation due to MDR/XDR TB.
• Capreomycin thrice weekly from the start may be considered to decrease drug exposure
to the foetus if an injectable agent need to be given.
• Injectable agent may be given for three to six months postpartum even in the middle of
treatment but it is not necessary if the patient remain well and past eight months period
for injectable agent.
• Ethionamide should be avoided due to risk of nausea and vomiting associated with
pregnancy, and potential teratogenic effects.
• Termination of pregnancy should be considered if the mother’s life is compromised.4
• Treatment should be given for duration the same as for standard MDR-TB treatment.
9.2 Breastfeeding
Transmission of DR-TB during breast feeding may occur from the mother to the baby especially
in smear positive cases. Small concentration of all second-line drugs is found in breast milk,
however any effect to breast fed infant has not been established.

• Breastfeeding woman who has active drug-resistant TB should receive a full course of
anti-TB treatment.
• The infant formula is preferred to reduce transmission and avoid side effects of drugs in
smear positive mother;
i. the care of infant should be left to family members until smear become negative
ii. the mother should wear surgical mask whenever the mother and infant are together
and they should be in well-ventilated areas or outdoors until sputum negative.
9.3 Contraception
There are potential drug-drug interactions between anti-TB and contraceptive pills which may
reduce drug’s efficacy or increase toxicity.
There is no contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives with non-rifamycin containing
regimens for MDR-TB, however some patient may develop nausea and vomiting which may
affect absorption and reduce efficacy of oral contraceptive drugs. Rifampicin used for patients
with mono- and poly-resistant TB but who are susceptible to rifampicin interacts with the
contraceptive drugs resulting in decreased efficacy of protection against pregnancy
Recommendation 9
• All sexually active women receiving therapy for drug-resistant TB must use effective
contraception.
• Patients who vomits after taking anti-TB drugs should be advised to take their
contraceptive at different time, use barrier methods or contraceptive implants.
A woman on oral contraception while receiving rifampicin treatment may choose between
two options:
•
use an oral contraceptive pill containing a higher dose of estrogen (50ug) or
•
use another form of contraception
Condoms are a reasonable solution for patients who do not want to take additional pills and/or
when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is also needed.
Medroxyprogesterone intramuscular injections and other methods of contraception can also be
considered (refer to medical eligibility criteria for contraception WHO 2004 document).
9.4 Renal insufficiency
Renal insufficiency can be due to longstanding TB infection, previous use of aminoglycoside
and other causes. In administration of second-line drugs in patients with renal insufficiency, the
dose and/or the interval between dosing should be adjusted accordingly (refer table 13) and
renal function monitoring should be done closely.

For creatinine clearance 20–40 ml/min dose 500 mg every 8
hours; for creatinine clearance <20 ml/min dose 500 mg every
9.5 Liver disorders
All first-line drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide are associated with
hepatotoxicity. Rifampicin is least likely to cause hepatocellular damage, although it is
associated with cholestatic jaundice. Pyrazinamide is the most hepatotoxic of the three first-line
drugs. Among the second-line drugs, ethionamide, prothionamide and PAS can also be
hepatotoxic, although less so than any of the first-line drugs. Fluoroquinolones can rarely cause
hepatitis.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
38
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
38
Patients with history of liver disease can receive the usual anti-TB drug regimens provided
there is no clinical evidence of severe chronic liver disease, hepatitis virus carriage and
recent history of acute hepatitis or excessive alcohol consumption.
Hepatotoxic reactions to anti-TB drugs may be more common in DR- TB patients and should be
anticipated.
Recommendation 10
• Patients with chronic liver diseases should not receive pyrazinamide but all other drugs
can be used with close monitoring of liver enzymes.
In acute hepatitis, it is possible to defer anti-TB treatment until it has been resolved but in other
cases when it is necessary to treat drug-resistant TB during acute hepatitis, the combination of
four non hepatotoxic drugs is the safest option.
Viral hepatitis should be treated if medically indicated and treatment can occur during drugresistant TB treatment.
9.6 Seizure disorders
The initial step in evaluating patients with current or previous seizure disorder is to assess
whether the seizure is under control and whether the patient is taking antiepileptic drugs.
Initiation or adjustment of antiepileptic drugs is needed if the seizure is not under control as well
as correcting underlying conditions or causes of seizures.
Cycloserine should be avoided if possible in patients with active seizure disorders that are
not well controlled
Recommendation 11
• The risks and benefits of using cycloserine should be discussed with the patient and the
decision on whether to use cycloserine should be made together with the patient.
• High dose isoniazid should be avoided in patients with active seizure disorders because it
carries higher risk of seizure.
• Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) can be used prophylactically in patients with seizure disorders to
protect against the neurological adverse effects of isoniazid or cycloserine.
Prophylactic dose of pyridoxine for at-risk patients on isoniazid is 10 to 25 mg/day and for
patients on cycloserine is 25 mg of pyridoxine for every 250 mg of cycloserine daily.
Isoniazid and rifampicin use in mono and poly-resistant cases may interfere and interact with
many of the antiepileptic medications.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
39
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
39
9.7 Psychiatric disorders
Treatment of MDR TB patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness often complicated. Incidence
of depression and anxiety in patients with drug-resistant TB is high and often due to chronicity
and socioeconomic stress factors related to the disease.
Recommendation 12
• Careful evaluation of any psychiatric illness should be done before initiation of DR-TB
treatment.
• Psychiatric patients should be evaluated by a health care worker with psychiatric training
before the start of treatment for drug-resistant TB.
Treatment with psychiatric medication, individual counselling and/or group therapy may be
necessary.
Cycloserine can be used in patients with psychiatric disorders because its benefits may
outweigh the risk, however close monitoring of psychiatric symptom is recommended. All health
care workers treating drug-resistant TB should work closely with a mental health specialist and
easy access to emergency and other psychiatric treatment should be made available easily.
9.8 DR-TB in children
Children with DR-TB generally acquire the disease transmitted from adult with drug-resistant
TB. Young children living with DR-TB patients, have high risk of being infected and developing
active DR-TB. The clinical presentation of drug-resistant TB in children is similar to drugsensitive TB disease.
Criteria for suspecting DR-TB in children include:
• Close contact with a person with confirmed or suspected DR-TB.
• History of previously treated TB present with recurrence of the disease.
• Failure to respond to first line TB treatment despite good adherence.
The diagnostic workup of DR-TB in a child should include the following:
•
clinical evaluation by a paediatrician (including history and physical examination)
•
a chest radiograph and other diagnostic tests (as indicated)
•
tuberculin skin testing
•
sputum / gastric lavage investigations: smear microscopy, culture and rapid DST (Xpert
MTB/RIF assay)
•
HIV testing
In cases of extrapulmonary TB, fine needle aspiration or biopsy should be considered.
Specimens obtained must be sent for diagnostic TB testings, also microbiological culture and
histopathological examination to rule out other infective or non-infective diseases.
Recommendation 13
• Children with DR-TB should be referred to paediatrician with experience in TB
management.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
40
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
40
Information on paediatric DR-TB and reported experience on the use of second-line drugs
(injectable anti-TB) for extended periods in children is very limited. Thus far, the second-line
anti-TB drugs were reported to be well tolerated in children who have received the therapy.
However, in children with mild forms of disease, second-line anti-TB drugs may be avoided. If
the use of the drugs is inevitable the risks and benefits of each drug should be discussed with
family members at the outset of therapy.
DST should be used to guide therapy when available and treatment may be guided by the
anti-TB history and DST results of the adult contact. Refer to figure 7.

10. DR-TB AND HIV INFECTION
HIV is a significant risk factor for all forms of TB, both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant. The
presence of HIV coinfection makes the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB more
challenging, especially in MDR- and XDR-TB.
HIV infected patients are more likely to have smear-negative TB or extrapulmonary TB
(including MDR-TB and XDR-TB).
DR-TB is associated with higher mortality rates in the HIV-infected patients
Early diagnosis of the DR-TB and HIV infection, prompt treatment with appropriate 2nd line antiTB drugs, timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, strong infection control measures and good
social support are all crucial components in management of DR-TB in people living with HIV.
For patients with advanced HIV disease, mycobacterial culture of sputum and other fluids
(e.g. blood, pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid and bone-marrow aspirates) and
histopathology (e.g. lymph node biopsies) are helpful in diagnosis.
ART is recommended for all patients with HIV and DR TB requiring second-line anti-TB
drugs, irrespective of CD4 cell-count, as early as possible (within the first 8 weeks) following
initiation of anti-TB treatment
A common first line ART regime used in HIV infected patients with MDR-TB is AZT + 3TC +
EFV. TDF is generally avoided due to the overlapping renal toxicity with the injectables, but AZT
(anaemia) and d4T (peripheral neuropathy) have even more common side effects that may
make them unsuitable for some MDR- and XDR-TB patients. If TDF is used, additional
monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is indicated.
Immune reconstitute inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an augmented inflammatory response
that occurs in patients commenced on HAART and anti-TB drugs.
IRIS generally presents within three months of the initiation of ART and is more common
with a low CD4 cell count (<50 cells/mm3).
This syndrome can present as a paradoxical worsening of the patient’s clinical status
The treatment of DR-TB in patients with HIV is very similar to that in patients without HIV, with
the following exceptions: the need of ART and possibility of IRIS, the potential drug-drug
interaction between ART and anti-TB drugs and more frequent adverse effects requiring more
intense monitoring.
People living with HIV need to be given the same consideration for treatment with the shorter
MDR-TB treatment regimen as people who are HIV seronegative.
The composition of the treatment regimen for MDR-TB does not differ for people living with HIV.
However, thioacetazone should not be given to patients who are HIV positive; if it is being
considered as part of a treatment regimen HIV infection needs to be reliably excluded in the
patient.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
44
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
44
Recommendation 15
• Provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling should be performed in all TB suspects
• Mycobacterial cultures should be sent. DST should be done at the start of anti-TB to avoid
mortality due to unrecognized DR-TB in HIV-infected patients
• Xpert MTB/RIF should be used as the initial diagnostic test in HIV- associated TB (WHO
2014)
• The extent (or prevalence) of anti-TB drug resistance in HIV-infected patients should be
determined
• Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated promptly in DR-TB/HIV patients, irrespective of
CD4 cell-count, within the first 8 weeks of starting anti-TB drugs (WHO 2011, 2014)
• Co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) should be provided to all HIV- infected patients
with active TB
• Additional nutritional and socioeconomic support may be implemented
• Effective infection control measures should be ensured
• Overlapping toxicities with ART and DR-TB therapy should be closely monitored
For drug- drug interaction summary and potential overlapping and additive toxicities of ART and
anti-TB treatment refer to Appendix 5.

11. INITIATING TREATMENT AND MONITORING OF TREATMENT
Proper treatment initiation is crucial in ensuring the success of DR-TB treatment. It requires
collaboration of medical doctors, patient,family members and public health personel. One
should anticipate multiple medical and social issues in patient with DR-TB. Proper treatment
initiation includes:
i.
Medical evaluation.
ii.
Counseling of patient.
11.1 Initial medical evaluation
Pretreatment assessment should be systematically conducted on all patients to identify those at
risk of adverse effects and poor outcomes, and to establish a baseline information.
The required initial pretreatment clinical investigation includes a thorough medical history and
physical examination. The conditions to be screened for at initial medical evaluation are
presented in Table 16.
Table 16: Conditions to be screened for at initial medical evaluation
• HIV infection
• Acute or chronic liver
• Pregnancy
• Diabetes mellitus
disease
• Breast feeding
• Hypertension
• Mental illness
• Seizures
• Renal insufficiency
• Drug or alcohol
• Malnutrition
• Thyroid diseases
dependency
All patients starting MDR-TB treatment should have the following examinations done:
i.
Weight and height
ii.
Chest radiograph
iii.
Acid-fast smear, mycobacterial cultures and DST to both first- and second-line drugs
•
The initial evaluation may require a repeat or confirmation DST, or further DST for
other anti-TB drugs.
•
For a patient to be considered bacteriologically positive, a culture, or molecular test
or sputum smear must be positive at the start of DR-TB treatment.
•
The collection date of the sample should be less than 30 days before, or maximum
seven days after the initiation of - DR-TB treatment. Specimens collected prior to
start of treatment are preferred
iv.
Full blood count, renal, electrolytes (potassium, magnesium and calcium) and liver
function test, thyroid function test and HIV testing
v.
Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age
•
Methods of preventing pregnancy during treatment for women of childbearing age
should be discussed and agreed upon with the patient during the initial visit
vi.
Audiometry
vii.
Electrocardiogram
viii.
Baseline psychosocial assessment by trained personnel in the skills of psychosocial
management during MDR-TB treatment

11.2 Counseling of the patient for treatment and education
Preparing the patient for treatment involves educating the patient and family, including the
understanding of disease, drugs used, length of treatment, possible side effects and support
that will be available for the patient. It also includes information on how the patient can protect
his/her family and household members from getting TB. Educating the patient should ultimately
help the patient obtain better adherence.
Patient education takes place over several visits with different health care providers. There
should be a well-formulated plan on how to educate both the patient and their family/care givers
so that they have complete information.Table 17 provides a short checklist for the health care
provider to help best prepare the patient for treatment.
Table 17: Clinician checklist to go over with the patient before treatment starts
•
Discuss where treatment will start. If at a hospital, estimate the approximate length of
stay. If at home ask about the home living situation and whether or not the patient feels
home treatment will be possible.
•
Inform the patient the about the length of treatment; that it will be for at least 20 months
but may be longer.
•
Educate the patient about the drugs and possible side effects: there are at least five antiTB drugs, of which one is an injectable agent. Inform patients that they must report any
side effects of the medications immediately.
•
Educate the patient about monitoring requirements for smear, culture and laboratory
tests.
•
Make a follow-up plan for seeing the doctor and inform the patient if he/she has
problems they should be seen sooner. Make sure they know how to make an
appointment if they need to be seen before the next routine visit.
•
Instruct patients what to do in case of an emergency (like severe shortness of breath).
•
Educate patients how DR-TB can be transmitted and some basics about household
infection control. The patient is most infectious during the first few days or weeks of
treatment when he/she is still smear positive.
•
Windows and doors should be left open in the home to increase ventilation.
•
A smear positive patient should wear a surgical or cloth mask at all possible times.
•
it is safer to visit with family and friends if the patient is outdoors in the open air.
11.3 Monitoring treatment response
Monitoring response to treatment is done through regular history taking, physical examination,
chest radiograph and laboratory monitoring. The classic symptoms of TB – cough, sputum
production, fever and weight loss – generally improve within the first few weeks. Persistence of
these classical symptoms may suggest treatment failure, but at times can persist in patients with
extensive lung damage despite culture conversion.
The chest radiograph may appear unchanged in the first few months of treatment or show only
slight improvement, especially in patients with chronic pulmonary lesions. Chest radiographs
should be taken at least every six months or when indicated:
•
to document progress
•
to use for comparison if the patient’s clinical condition changes
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
47
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
47
Monthly monitoring of sputum smears and cultures throughout treatment enables the
programme to timely identify conversion or failure to convert. The most important evidence of
improvement is conversion of the sputum culture to negative. Sputum smear is still useful due to
its shorter turnaround time. Delayed detection of failure can increase transmission and increase
the probability of acquisition resistance to the patient’s strain, making it harder to cure the
patient after failure.
Recommendation 16
• The use of sputum smear microscopy and culture rather than sputum smear microscopy
alone is recommended for the monitoring of patients with multidrug- resistant TB (MDRTB) during treatment.
Culture conversion should not be taken as equivalent to cure. Monthly sputum smear and TB
culture should continue to be performed during maintanence phase. This is because Initial
culture conversion is not always maintained. Some patients can have culture reversion in a later
date.
Molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF and line probe assays should not be used to monitor
response to treatment.
DST can be repeated for patients who remain smear and culture positive or who are suspects
for treatment failure. In such cases, it is usually not necessary to repeat DST within less than
two to three months of the previous DST.
A key component of monitoring the progress of treatment is patient-centred DOT. All treatment
should be given under daily DOT and DOT providers should be trained on the symptoms of
adverse effects and treatment failure.
Table 18 summarizes the activities for monitoring treatment response.

Chest radiograph
At baseline, and then every six months unless otherwise
indicated.
Follow-up schedule for clinical and laboratory follow-up for uncomplicated MDR-TB patients is
shown in Table 19.
More frequent screening may be advisable for certain types of patients as below:
i.
Creatinine and potassium may be done more frequently in the elderly, DM, HIV
coinfected, and those with pre-existing renal disease.
ii.
Liver function tests may be done every 1-3 weeks in patients with active liver disease.
iii.
TSH shoud be done every three months if receiving ethionamide/prothionamide and p-
aminosalicylic acid (PAS), otherwise every six months if receiving ethionamide/
prothionamide or PAS, but not both together. Monthly monitoring for clinical
signs/symptoms of hypothyroidism is also necessary.
iv.
Regular HIV serology testing in high HIV prevalence settings.
v.
Monitoring of adverse effects of other specific drugs should be carried out as required.
MDR-TB treatment chart can be used during follow up (refer appendix 6).
11.4 Follow-up after successful completion of MDR-TB treatment
Review patient for history and physical examination. Checks sputum culture six monthly for two
years after completion date to evaluate for possible recurrence.

12. MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EFFECTS
Up to 70% of patients developed some forms of adverse effects from the MDRTB treatment.
Some patients may need treatment interrupted or modified due to adverse effect. Managing
adverse reaction is vital to ensure success to treatment. Ignoring patient’s compliant on adverse
drug effect will only leads to non-compliant and failure of treatment.
12.1 Monitoring for adverse effects during treatment
Close monitoring of patients is necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of second-line antiTB drugs are recognized quickly. All patients on second-line anti-TB drugs should be put under
DOT. The major advantage of DOT is the ability to monitor adverse effect early, besides
ensuring compliance.
All DOT providers should be trained to screen patients regularly for symptoms of common
adverse effects. During each patient visit, a systematic method for screening of drugs adverse
reaction should be done by DOT provider. Some common adverse drug events are listed in
table 20.
Table 20: Common or relevant adverse effects of drug-resistant TB therapy

Abdominal pain
Visual disturbances
Diarrhoea
Anorexia
Seizures

Psychosis
Hearing disturbances
Depression
Suicidal ideation
Headache
Tinnitus
Hepatitis (hepatotoxicity)
Sleep disturbances
Allergic reaction
Renal failure (nephrotoxicity)
Electrolyte disturbances
Rash
QT prolongation
There are a number of relatively common toxicities that are complicated to monitor, and can be
life threatening or very disabling to the patient; they necessitate extra attention in monitoring
(refer to table 21).
Table 21: Common toxicities that is complicated to monitor and need extra attention in
monitoring
Side effect
Comments
Nephrotoxicity
Cause by injectable agents (aminoglycosides and capreomycin)
Risk factors: patient with low baseline Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR),
HIV, diabetes, concomitant administration of nephrotoxic agents and
advanced age. Generally renal function should be done at least monthly.
However, for those patients with higher risk, more frequent renal function
should be done.
Electrolyte
wasting
Late complication of injectable drugs, both aminoglycosides and
capreomycin. Serum electrolyte should be monitor at least monthly.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
51
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
51
Hypothyroidism
Cause by PAS and/or ethionamide/ prothionamide. Symptoms are subtle
in the early stage. Patients should be routinely screened for
hypothyroidism with a serum TSH at baseline and every three months for
the first six months, then every six months thereafter
Ototoxicity
Due to injectable agents. Manifested by hearing loss, tinnitus and/or other
vestibular symptoms, such as nystagmus, ataxia. Hearing loss begins at
higher frequencies and progresses to low frequencies; speech freguency
(lower frequency) is affected late. It is generally non-reversible.
Audiometry for baseline and/or follow-up testing is required to pick up
early hearing loss. It is recommended to do audiometry every month while
on the injectable agent
Psychiatric
disturbances
Psychosis and depression can result in thoughts of suicide and even
suicide. Assessment of the patient’s psychosocial condition should be
performed monthly.
12.2 Management of adverse effects
Proper management of adverse effects begins with education of all stakeholders involved in
treatment and care. Prompt evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of adverse effects are
important, even if the adverse effect is not particularly dangerous. Patients may have significant
fear and anxiety about an adverse effect if they do not understand why it is happening. These
emotions can result in non-compliance to treatment.
If the adverse effect is mild and not dangerous, continuing the treatment regimen with the help
of ancillary drugs if needed is often the best option. The adverse effects of a number of secondline drugs are highly dose dependent. Reducing the dosage of the offending drug is another
method of managing adverse effects but only in cases where the reduced dose is still expected
to produce adequate serum levels and not compromise the regimen. Lowering the dose by
more than one weight class should be avoided.
Temporarily suspending the offending drug can be tried initially to alleviate adverse effects. The
offending drug can be re-introduced later if needed, in smaller dose initially and slowly titrate up
to optimal dose to improve tolerability.
Suspending permanently the offending drug may be the last option in dealing with serious
adverse effect. Usually required replacement with another effective agent. However, a
satisfactory replacement may not be available, and this can resulting in lots of regimen efficacy,
thus potentially treatment failure.
Some adverse effects may disappear or diminish with time, and patients may be able to
continue receiving the drug if sufficiently motivated.
Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) should be given to all patients receiving cycloserine or terizidone to help
prevent neurological adverse effects. The recommended dose is 50 mg for every 250 mg of
cycloserine (or terizidone) prescribed. Appendix 7 summaries the common adverse effects, the
likely responsible anti-TB drugs and the suggested management strategies for adverse effects.

13. TREATMENT DELIVERY AND COMMUNITY BASED DRUG-RESISTANT TB SUPPORT
Treatment adherence is one of the important factors to achieve successful DR-TB treatment.
Although treatment has been provided at hospital and clinic settings, the delivery of such care
and support at community-based setting or ambulatory care is now being emphasised.
The multidisciplinary team involves community health workers (CHWs).
Adherence to therapy requires adequate support measures which include enablers and
incentives:
• TB health education should include topic on adherence to therapy and continuously given
throughout the course of treatment. The education can be provided by HCWs and the
materials used are culturally-sensitive.
• DOT is a must in all DR-TB which can be provided by any trained and reliable supervisor
in all settings. It should be patient and family friendly. Strict confidentiality should be
maintained.
• Socioeconomic problems should be addressed to enable patients and families to adhere
which include enablers and incentives
• Psychosocial and emotional support by multidisciplinary team should be offered to
overcome stigma and adverse effects of long term treatment
• A workable system for monitoring and tracing for lost to follow up patient must be in place.
The approach should be in a sympathetic and non-judgemental.
Patients with DR-TB are more likely to have history of non-adherence. Adherence is difficult
because of prolonged treatment regimens, multiple drugs and adverse effects. The choice for
treatment delivery setting should emphasise on steady drugs supply, free of charges and
reliable network of educated providers.
13.1 Community based care
Community based care should be provided by the community or organizations where patient are
given ambulatory treatment. CHWs need appropriate training, support, continuous supervision
by health personnel, visit patient at home or workplace and ideally should not be a family
member to prevent patient manipulation.
Recommendation 17
 State and District TB Organiser should use various strategies to improve treatment
adherence such as
•
TB health education
•
DOT supervision
•
socioeconomic and emotional support
•
monitoring of adverse effects
 Ministry of Health and State Health Department should incorporate community-based
care and support into their National/ State Strategic Plan for TB.
Community care supporter can be local health personnel, former or current patient, affected
families, associations, cooperatives, grass root organisation, local NGOs, community volunteers
and many more.

Function of Community Care Supporters
• Assist on treatment delivery, early detection and simple care for adverse reactions,
prompt referral, and psychological support
• Ensure highly effective adherence through DOT by former patient or local community
member.
• Assist contact tracing to improve new case detection and infection control.
• Promote health education on simple infection control practices at home
• Assist in recording and reporting of data within family and community assist in training
using materials written in lay languages and peer educators.
• Involvement in giving support to reduce stigma. Identify socioeconomic and
psychological needs and help to channel effective and timely support.
CHWs and community based support advocacy can facilitate patient access to hospital, during
hospitalisation and when returning to ambulatory treatment. Ownership by the community
supporters is more sustainable. Monitoring of CHWs should be done by health staff. A
communications network should be clear and in place between community volunteers and
health staff.

14. PALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CARE
Patients who their second-line anti-TB have been stopped because of treatment failure still need
to be alleviated of their suffering and prevent further transmission.
14.1 Approach to suspending therapy
Medical therapy suspension is recommended when there are no more options of drugs to be
prescribed and surgery is also not an option.
Three considerations that then need to be considered are:
•
the patient’s quality of life: Adverse effects from drugs of a failing regime may cause
unnecessary suffering.
•
the public health interest: Continuing a failing regime will create highly resistant strains
that will infect others.
•
the model of care available: The available resources to provide palliative care and
infection control.
A multi-disciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurses, DOT providers, patients and their
carers must come up with a plan that covers all the above.
14.2 Palliative and end-of-life care for patients in whom all the possibilities of treatment
have failed
Palliative care delivery can be delivered either in a hospital, palliative care units and patient’s
home. The benefits for MDR-TB patients to receive palliative care are that it:
• provides relief from respiratory distress, pain and other symptoms;
• affirms life and regards dying as a normal process;
• intends neither to hasten nor to postpone death;
• integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care;
• offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death;
• offers a support system to help the family cope during the patient’s illness and in their own
bereavement;
• uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including
bereavement counselling, if indicated;
• enhances quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness; and
• is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with second-line anti-TB
medications, with the main therapy intended to prolong life through cure.
Supportive care measures are summarized in Table 22.
14.3 Infection control measures and domicile considerations for the end-of-life MDR-TB
patient
Patients whom treatment has been stopped remain infectious. Environmental and Personal
Protection measures must be in place. Particulate respirators (N95) masks must be used by
care givers and health care providers.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
55
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
55
Table 22: End of life supportive measures
• Relief from dyspnoea. Oxygen may be used to alleviate shortness of breath in some
cases but there is no significant evidence to generalize its practice. Morphine provides
significant relief from respiratory insufficiency and should be offered according to
established clinical protocols available in the medical literature.
• Relief from pain and other symptoms. Paracetamol, or codeine with paracetamol,
gives relief from moderate pain. If possible, stronger analgesics, including morphine,
should be used when appropriate to keep the patient adequately comfortable. The WHO
has developed analgesic guides, pain scales and a three step “ladder” for pain relief.
• Infection control measures. The patient who is taken off anti-TB treatment because of
failure often remains infectious. Infection control measures should be continued with
reinforcement of environmental and personal measures, including N-95 mask use for
caregivers.
• Nutritional support. Small and frequent meals are often best for a person at the end of
life. It should be accepted that the intake will reduce as the patient’s condition deteriorates
and during end-of-life care. Nausea and vomiting or any other conditions that interfere
with nutritional support should be treated.
• Regular medical visits. When MDR-TB treatment stops, regular visits by health-care
providers and the support team should be continued to address medical needs and
ensure that infection control practices are being followed.
• Continuation of ancillary medicines. All necessary ancillary medications should be
continued as needed. Codeine helps control cough, as well as pain. Other cough
suppressants can be added. Bronchospasms can be controlled with a metre-dosed
inhaler with a spacer or mask. Depression and anxiety, if present, should be addressed.
Antiemetic’s may still be needed and fever treated if the patient is uncomfortable.
• Hospitalization, hospice care or nursing home care. Having a patient die at home can
be difficult for the family and the other way around. Home-based care should be offered to
patients and families who want to keep the patient at home, whenever appropriate
infection control practices can be followed. Institutionally based end of- life care should be
available to those for whom home care is not feasible or desirable. Availability of
respiratory isolation facilities is essential when a patient is transferred to institutionally
based palliative care for medical reasons and the patient remains infectious.
• Preventive measures. Oral care, prevention of bedsores, bathing and prevention of
muscle contractures are indicated in all patients. Regular scheduled movement of the
bedridden patient is very important. Encourage patients to move their bodies in bed if
able. Keeping beds dry and clean are also important.
• Provide psychosocial support. Psychological counselling to the patient and family
caregivers is critical at this stage, especially to assist patients in the planning of decisions
related with the end of life, and provide emotional support, especially in settings in which
strong stigma is attached to the disease.
• Respect for patient’s beliefs and values at the end of life. It is common for the patient
and family caregivers to develop or increase their interest in spiritual and religious matters
once they perceive that the end of life is approaching. The healthcare providers should
respect those beliefs and should not impose personal values and practices that prevent
the patient to seek and find comfort in the services delivered by faith-based organizations.

15. MANAGEMENT OF CONTACTS OF MDR/ XDR-TB PATIENTS
Contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patient are defined as people living in the same household,
workplace or spending many hours a day together with the index case in the same indoor living
space. However there is no universal definition on duration of exposure for close contacts or
casual contact. Therefore, the operational definition for MDR/XDR-TB varies between regions,
countries and states.
Close contacts are likely to be infected because they have a long and frequent exposure with
infectious patient. They are also more likely to develop active TB because of their exposure.
The investigation for the contacts of MDR/XDR-TB is to prevent the transmission of the resistant
strain either inside or outside the home or at workplace so that they can be treated immediately.
It also can provide the opportunity to educate the contacts about issues related to TB and
MDR/XDR-TB
Management of MDR/XDR-TB contacts should be integrated into the Programmatic
Management of MDR/XDR-TB. General considerations should be given to MDR/XDR-TB
contacts:
•
Screening for MDR-TB contact should be given high priority
•
Screening for XDR-TB contact should be considered as an emergency situation
•
All contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patient should have a proper follow-up
All MDR/XDR-TB cases need urgent attention and therefore a structured programme for
management of case and their contacts should be in place to contain the disease
(containment phase).
Close contacts of MDR/XDR-TB are at high risk of being infected by the index case and
developing active TB.
15.1 Management of contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patients
All contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patients must be identified promptly for evaluation of active TB
disease. Close contacts of MDR/XDR-TB should be screened more aggressive than among
those contacts of the drugs susceptible cases. Routine symptomatic and physical examination
for all MDR/XDR-TB contacts including asking about productive cough, haemoptysis, fever, loss
of appetite, loss of weight, night sweat and other sign and symptom of TB. Rapid test for
rifampicin resistant (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF) has a big role in contact management. It should be
considered if there is an access to the service because active case can be treated and
managed promptly. All close contacts must be followed up at least at intervals of 0, 3, 6, 12
months for two years (refer Figure 8).
Recommendation 18
• All MDR/XDR-TB contacts should be put under surveillance for at least two years and
evaluated for active TB regularly (0, 3, 6, 12 months interval).
Recommendation 19
• Rapid test such as Xpert MTB/RIF is recommended for symptomatic MDR/XDR-TB
contact as an initial diagnostic test because it provides diagnosis of TB and Rifampicin
Resistant rapidly.

15.2 Empirical treatment of MDR/XDR-TB contacts
Contacts who develop active TB should undergo rapid test such as Xpert MTB/RIF. They should
be started on empirical regime that similar to index case or the most common regime in the
community while waiting for the culture and DST result.
Recommendation 20
• MDR/XDR-TB contacts with active disease should be treated empirically with same antiTB regimen as the index case.
15.2.1 Contacts with bacteriologically confirmed TB, without confirmation of MDR/XDRTB
•
MDR/XDR-TB contact may be infected with similar or different strain. However, most of the
close contact is infected with the same MDR/XDR strain.
•
Rapid molecular test should be performed to all bacteriologically confirmed contacts.
•
In the absence of rapid molecular test, confirmation of drug resistance with conventional
method may take weeks or months.
•
These contacts should be treated empirically with same anti-TB regimen as the index case
while pending DST.
•
MDR/XDR-TB empirical treatment may include Isoniazide and Rifampicin base on clinical
judgement by physician because it is easier to switch to first line anti-TB regimen if DST
result showed pan-susceptible.
•
However, ineffective regimen at long period may result in amplification of resistance or
death.
15.2.2 Extrapulmonary TB contacts
•
Certain Extrapulmonary TB is often culture negative. Therefore, contacts with
extrapulmonary TB should be started empirically with MDR/XDR-TB regimen as the index
case after collecting samples from suspected organs for histopathology examination, culture
and DST.
•
MDR/XDR-TB empirical treatment may include Isoniazide and Rifampicin base on clinical
judgement by physician because it is easier to switch to first line antiTB regimen if DST
result showed pan-susceptible.
•
This is particularly important for HIV patients where most of the times are smear and culture
negative. They are also at risk of developing severe forms of extrapulmonary TB that are
highly fatal.
15.2.3 Culture negative TB contacts
•
For MDR/XDR-TB contacts under 5 years, most are likely to be infected by same resistant
mycobacterium strain of the index case.
•
This is particularly important for contacts among children who often, had poor quality sputum
samples.
•
If the children fulfil the criteria for active TB, they should be considered for second-line
treatment of MDR/XDR-TB based on the clinical judgement.
15.3 Chemoprophylaxis of contacts of MDR-TB index case
WHO does not recommend the universal use of second-line anti-TB drugs for chemoprophylaxis
of MDR/XDR-TB contacts.

16. DRUG RESISTANCE AND INFECTION CONTROL
TB disease is transmissible, especially among highly vulnerable populations and congregate
settings such as shelter home, dormitories, barracks, prison, drug rehabilitation centre, old folks
home and immigration depot. MDR/XDR-TB patients may respond slower to treatment and
remain sputum positive longer than other drug susceptible TB patients and because of that they
may infect more contacts. All services attempting to treat MDR/XDR-TB should be in line with
the current policies and strategies. This is to ensure infection control activities are in place to
prevent transmission among patients, staff and community.
Infection control that consist of administrative, environment or engineering control and
personal respiratory protection is a high priority in managing MDR/XDR-TB cases.
16.1 The infection control methods
16.1.1 Administrative control
The administrative control is the most effective and least expensive and therefore have highest
priority in resource-constrained settings. These include policies and procedures.
•
Development of steering committee for MDR/XDR-TB infection control at national and state
level.
•
Development of infection control committee representing key departments/ units at health
care facilities or congregate settings.
•
Ensure adequate budget and personnel is allocated for infection control activities.
•
Formulation of a comprehensive infection control plan.
•
Prompt identification of infectious cases, separation from other people at well ventilated
waiting area, control the spread of microorganism, fast tracked for sputum examination and
minimize time contact with health facility. All coughing patients should receive face masks
and receive basic education about cough etiquette and hygiene.
•
Identify high risk area for MDR/XDR-TB transmission and do the environmental risk
assessment.
•
Provide a full package of prevention and control intervention for health care providers
including chemoprophylaxis for TB and HIV prevention.
•
Development of medical surveillance program/ policy for MDR/XDR-TB to ensure
environment is safe for health care provider to practice.
•
Create a database of TB among Health Care Workers and follow through all cases
especially MDR/XDR-TB.
•
Training for all staff on infection control policies and procedures. Educating all health care
providers and the community on MDR/XDR-TB infection control.
•
Provide and encourage structured MDR/XDR-TB infection control advocacy, social
mobilization and communication.
•
Patients should be encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors.
•
Encourage operational research.
DR-TB patients should be separated from immunosuppressive patient such as HIV, cancer,
SLE, elderly, babies etc. They should be placed in isolation until non-infectious. In resource
limited setting where isolation almost impossible, separation of these patients may help to
reduce transmission.

17. MANAGEMENT OF SECOND- LINE ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS
Drug management of second-line anti-TB provides information on the procedures for
procurement and management of the second-line drugs used in the treatment of DR-TB.
DR-TB must be managed appropriately in order to ensure that the correct medicines are
selected, procured in the right quantities, distributed to treatment centres in a timely manner,
handled and stored to maintain quality and availability of sufficient stocks, and used rationally by
the health worker and patient alike. Figure 9 shows pharmaceutical management cycle of
second-line anti-TB drugs.
Fig. 9: Pharmaceutical Management Cycle
Description of key functions of the drug management cycle
Quantification: sometimes called forecasting quantification is a process used to estimate the
amount of medicines and commodities needed by the national TB control programme for a
period of time. Quantification is a key planning step to prepare and justify budgets for
procurement. Procurement is timely acquisition of quality-assured anti-TB medicines and
commodities at the best possible cost.
Distribution is the process by which medicines are receives at the port of entry, cleared
through customs, transported from the central warehouse to storage and health facilities,
store and maintained at warehouses and treatment centres.
Rational use refers to proper use of medicines to improve patient safety by providing
comprehensive information on the use, dosage, adverse effects, contraindications, warnings
and guidance on selecting the right medicines for TB patients.
17.1 Selection of anti-TB drugs for programmatic management of drug-resistant TB
The selection process for MDR-TB medicines differs considerably from the selection of first-line
treatment because:
•
A number of different regimens and medicines may be prescribed at the start of and within
the treatment period due to the drug resistance patterns, availability affordability and long
treatment periods (up to 20 months or more);
Selection
Procurement
Distribution
Use
Management
Support
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
63
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
63
•
The medicines are more toxic to patients, which frequently results in changes made to the
original regimen prescribed;
•
Only a limited supply of quality assured MDR-TB medicines (according to international
Standards or WHO prequalification programme) is available; and medicines are much
more expensive (up to 100 times more than drug-susceptible TB).
Factors to be considered when selecting second- line drugs include the efficacy of the
drugs, the treatment strategy, possible adverse effects and the cost of the treatment.
17.2 Quantification and procurement
17.2.1 Quantification.
In order to procure appropriate quantities of these medicines, TB managers need to know how
many patients are currently under different treatment regimens and how many patients are
expected to be enrolled for each treatment regimen during the next planned procurement
period.
The following formula is used for quantification for total drug requirement:
Total drug requirement = (consumption of new patients) + (consumption of ongoing
patients) – (stock on hand)
Steps in forecasting of second-line anti-TB drug:
1. Obtain the following information and use the formula below to get the drug requirement for
new patient enrolment:
•
Number of new patients enrolled
•
Treatment regimen being used and duration of treatment for both intensive and
continuation phases (calculated in days per month x months of treatment)
•
Average daily dose per drug
•
Percentage (%) of utilization per drug
17.2.2 Procurement
Effective management of procurement ensures the availability of selected drugs of assured
standards of quality, in the right quantities, at the right time and at affordable prices. In instances
where an unregistered drug may need to be used, an application will need to be submitted to
the Pharmaceutical Services Division for the issuance of an Import Permit before the drug can
be imported into the country.
Elements to consider when planning procurement of second-line antituberculosis
drugs
•
Drug forecast based on treatment regimen, cohort size and pace of patient enrolment
•
Drug registration status of products selected
•
Drug labeling
•
Shelf-life of the products
•
Lead-time for delivery of the drug request
•
Estimated size of buffer stock (2–3 times the delivery delay)

17.3 Drug distribution, storage and ordering
Distribution is the process by which medicines are received at the port of entry, cleared
through customs, transported to the central warehouse and distributed to health centres. During
this process, second-line anti-TB drugs can be stored at different warehouses and treatment
centres.
Ordering medicines can occur in two ways – push and pull depending on whether the order is
placed by the treatment centre (pull) or whether the order quantities are decided by the TB
coordinator (push) at the district or national level. When placing orders, a standardized form
should be used so that medicines, strengths and dosage forms are correct for the treatment
regimens established by the TB programme.
17.4 Rational medicine use and adherence
In the specific case of DR-TB treatment, the best way to implement a rational use of drugs is to
follow the treatment recommendations. This will ensure the maximum benefit to the patients and
to the health programme at the same time. This has to be complemented with full adherence to
a properly prescribed treatment. From a drug management perspective, the health worker
should check that the patient knows at least the following about their treatment:
•
Name of their TB medicines
•
Number of tablets in one dose
•
Number of doses to take per day
•
When to return to the TB centre for more medicines
•
Need to report to the health care provider any adverse reactions that are encountered while
taking second-line anti-TB drugs.
A structured pharmacovigilance system in the programme is encouraged to ensure patients’
safety and proper management of any side effects. If adverse reactions are encountered, these
should be recorded in the patient’s case note and reported using the Adverse Drug Reaction
(ADR) form.

18. DR-TB RECORDING AND REPORTING SYSTEM
The organization of information on drug-resistant patients facilitates the:
•
standardization of patient data for registration;
•
assignment of appropriate treatment regimens;
•
monitoring of detection, patient enrolment and treatment and
•
surveillance of drug resistance.
The DR-TB information system allows NTP managers to follow trends in the number of DR-TB
cases notified and monitor overall programme performance.
Recommendation 21
• A standardised method of recording and reporting should be implemented in DR-TB
control programmes.
• DR-TB treatment cards should have an expanded section for information on patients with
HIV.
18.1 Registration of information on drug-resistant TB cases
Comprehensive DRTB information system consists of four main forms/registers as follow;
i.
Second-line TB treatment card
ii.
Second-line TB treatment register
iii.
Request for examination of biological specimen for TB
iv.
Laboratory register for culture, Xpert MTB/RIF and DST
The details of each forms/ registers which were adapted with slight modification from WHO
template (PMDT 2008) and explained in a separate guideline.
18.2 Indicators for monitoring drug-resistant TB programmes
Four sets of indicators on detection, enrolment, interim results and final outcomes are used for
programme management.
i. Detection indicators
•
TB patients with result for isoniazid and rifampicin DST
•
Confirmed MDR-TB cases detected among TB patients tested for susceptibility to
isoniazid and rifampicin
•
Confirmed MDR-TB cases tested for susceptibility to any fluoroquinolone and any
second-line injectable drug
•
Confirmed XDR-TB cases detected among MDR-TB patients tested for susceptibility to
any fluoroquinolone and any second-line injectable drug
•
Interval between presumption of RR-/MDR-TB and DST results
ii. Enrolment indicators
•
RR-/MDR-TB cases (presumptive or confirmed) enrolled on MDR-TB treatment
•
Confirmed RR-/MDR-TB cases enrolled on MDR-TB treatment regimen
•
Confirmed XDR-TB cases enrolled on XDR-TB treatment regimen
•
Interval between RR-/MDR-TB diagnosis and start of MDR-TB treatment
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)
66
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)

iii. Interim results indicators
•
RR-/MDR-TB cases on MDR-TB treatment regimen with negative culture by six months.
•
RR-/MDR-TB cases on MDR-TB treatment regimen who died by six months.
•
RR-/MDR-TB cases on MDR-TB treatment regimen who were lost to follow-up by six

19. MANAGING DR-TB THROUGH PATIENT-CENTRED CARE
MDR-TB often inflicts the poorest and most marginalized members of a society. Their quality of
life and financial situation are further aggravated by the disease, due to the adverse drug
reactions produced by its treatment, the catastrophic costs they incur while seeking care and
adhering to treatment and the stigma attached to the disease and subsequent discrimination.
The delivery of social support services is important and runs parallel with the efforts to prevent
and treat MDR-TB.
Social support may also contribute to improving the quality of life of patients. In many cases it
also makes a difference to enable the patient and family to access health care.
In this chapter the patient-centred care approach to directly observation of therapy and the
social support framework for programmatic management of drug-resistant TB are discussed.
19.1 Patient-centred care and its role in DOT
Adherence to DR- TB treatment is essential for cure. It is particularly difficult because of the
current lengthy recommended treatment regimens, the daily high pill burden, the frequent and
serious drug adverse reactions, and the indirect social and economic costs to patients
associated with access to care. Thus, MDR-TB patients are at increased risk of poor adherence
to treatment.
The patient-centred approach of the WHO TB strategy consists of enabling patients to exercise
their rights and fulfil their responsibilities with transparency, respect and dignity, by giving due
consideration to their values and needs. This may increase the chances of successful treatment
outcomes, and improve wellbeing and financial risk protection by improving adherence to
treatment, benefiting patients and society as a whole.
Given that MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treatment are often the last
therapeutic option for many patients and that there are serious public health consequences if
treatment fails, it is advisable that all patients receive medicines under DOT as a way to ensure
full adherence to treatment.
Recommendation 22
•
Patient-centred approach to treatment should be developed for all patients in order to
promote adherence and improve quality of life. This approach should be based on the
patient’s needs and mutual respect between the patient and the provider.
19.2 Social support in MDR-TB management
Social support refers to the person’s perception and confirmation that he/she is part of a social
network that cares for him/her. A large body of evidence has confirmed that social support is a
predictor of health status and mortality. Social support is determined by access to four
resources:
i.
Informational support refers to any useful information that helps a person to solve
problems.
ii.
Emotional support refers to all expressions of care that contribute to strengthen selfesteem through empathy, trust, encouragement and care, and helps with the
psychological challenges in life.
iii.
Companionship support refers to the help that makes a person feel that he or she
belongs to the social network, and that he or she can rely on it for certain needs.
iv.
Financial support as assistance to deal with daily hurdles.

19.2.1 Information support on the disease
All patients and their primary caretaker(s) should receive education about DR-TB and its
treatment and the need for adherence to therapy. Information and education interventions
should commence as soon as diagnosis is made and continue throughout the course of
treatment. Education can be provided by: physicians, nurses, community health workers and
other health-care providers. Materials should be appropriate to the literacy levels of the patient
and should be gender, age and culturally sensitive.
Tips for delivering key information to the MDR-TB patient
•
Always use a venue that guarantees confidentiality in communication.
•
Use language that reassures mutual respect and esteem between the patient,
caregivers and health-care providers.
•
Do not make promises that the health-care service cannot keep.
•
Avoid arguments and any discriminatory remarks for whatever conditions the patient
has.
•
Respect the patient’s right to choose.
•
Teach the patient how DR-TB can be transmitted (long exposure to contaminated air in
crowded conditions), how it cannot be transmitted (sexual relations, kisses, sharing
cutlery and clothes, etc.), and teach the essentials about household infection control
measures
•
While respecting patient’s religious beliefs explore proactively and clarify wrong notions
the patient may have about the disease and its treatment, especially those that may
become barriers to adhere to treatment.
•
Enable the patient to counteract stigma and discrimination by reassuring that his/ her
disease is not the result of any socially or morally inappropriate behaviour that he/she
has made in the past; and that many other patients have passed successfully through a
similar experience
19.2.2 Information support on MDR-TB treatment
There should be a well-formulated plan for preparing the patient for treatment. This includes
educating the patient and caretaker on the use of drugs, length of treatment, possible side
effects, and mechanisms to access support that will be available to the patient. Patient
information and education takes place over several visits with different health-care providers
(from the DOT provider to the physician). Information and educational pamphlets with reminders
of the main points, in the local language, are helpful.

Checklist of information and education issues to provide to patient and family
caregivers before starting MDR-TB treatment
• Inform the patient about the length of treatment according to the regimen selected –
often at least 20 months, but it may be shorter or longer.
• Discuss where treatment will start. If at a hospital, estimate the approximate length of
time. If at home, ask about the home living situation and whether or not the patient feels
home treatment will be possible.
• Teach the patient about the drugs in general terms: i.e. there are at least five different
anti-TB drugs, which the patient will take, of which one is an injectable agent. Try to
teach the names of the drugs and show what the pills look like.
• Teach the patient about possible side effects and the actions to take once detected,
including reporting to the DOT provider, especially those with serious consequences
like any hearing loss, ringing in the ears or suicidal ideation.
• Teach the patient about monitoring requirements for smear, culture and laboratory tests
for early detection of side effects.
• Make sure that patients and caregivers know how to make an appointment if they need
to be seen before the next routine visit.
• Make sure they know that the DOT provider can contact a doctor urgently at any time of
the day.
• Instruct them what to do in case of an emergency (like severe shortness of breath,
seizure, etc.)
• Always provide a copy of the TB Patient Charter, informing the patients about their
rights and responsibilities related with the treatment and prevention and control of TB;
• Inform patient and family caregivers on social support and social protection options the
patient is eligible for according to the existing law in the country, including palliative and
end-of-life care as needed.
19.2.3 Emotional support
Having MDR-TB can be an emotionally devastating experience for patients and their social
networks. Considerable stigma is attached to the disease, and this may interfere with adherence
to therapy, and may badly affect the quality of life of patients in view of the discrimination that
follows stigma.
The provision of emotional support services to patients may increase the likelihood of therapy
adherence, and the acquisition of skills to deal with stigma and discrimination. This support may
be organized in the form of support groups or in one-to one counselling by trained providers.
Informal support can also be provided by physicians, nurses, DOT providers, drug-resistant TB
supporters and family members. The establishment of support groups may allow patients with
drug-resistant TB to meet and socialize with other patients and provide emotional support to
each other.
Psychological support to MDR-TB patients through peer-to-peer and group support
• A counsellor, social worker or someone trained in facilitating support groups should
facilitate the meeting. A trained drug-resistant TB community nurse or health worker
may co-facilitate the group
• Clear eligibility criteria should be created for participation in each support group:
• Participation should be generally reserved for patients who are sputum negative and are
no longer infectious, especially if the meeting cannot take place in an open space.

19.4 Adherence monitoring and the follow-up of the non-adherent patient
When a patient fails to attend a DOT appointment or refuses to take their medicines, a system
should be in place that allows prompt patient follow-up. Most commonly, this system will involve
the drug-resistant TB clinic or community nurse, doctor or supervisor assisting the drug-resistant
TB DOT supporter by visiting the patient’s home the same day to find out why the patient has
defaulted and ensure that treatment is resumed promptly and effectively. The situation should
be addressed in a sympathetic, friendly and non-judgmental manner. Every effort should be
made to listen to the patient’s reasons for missing a dose(s) and to work with the patient and the
family to ensure continuation of treatment.
The following steps should be taken for patients showing any signs of possible poor adherence:
•
Home visit by the health-care provider involved in the drug-resistant TB programme: The
drug-resistant TB clinic or community nurse, doctor or supervisor should visit the home of
the patient together with, or in addition to, the drug-resistant TB DOT supporter, as during
the home visit it may be possible to identify more clinical problems than during the monthly
clinic evaluation.
•
Manage side effects: This is one of the most common reasons for the MDR-TB patient to be
lost to follow-up.
•
Counselling: The patient may no longer want to continue treatment because he/she feels
better, and therefore, feels treatment is no longer necessary. Additionally, the patient’s
perspective about his/her care should be assessed. The patient may have greater
confidence in alternative or folk medicine. If this is the case, the drug-resistant TB DOT
supporter, along with a nurse, doctor or community supervisor, should explore ways in
which to meet the patient’s needs, all the while putting them back on treatment.
•
Address economic problems: Many patients are unable to work when they are ill, and may
be the primary wage earners for their family. An assessment related to basic housing, food
and clothing needs should be explored and ways to assist with these issues addressed.
•
Address addiction or other social problems: Alcohol consumption and drug abuse are known
issues, which affect treatment adherence. Patients should be encouraged to stop or
decrease consumption.
•
Involve the family: Family is the most important source of psychosocial support for the
patient. When a patient has no family, have the patient identify a person who can act as a
caregiver.
•
Involve community leaders: Community and religious leaders can be helpful if there are
community-wide issues, such as stigma towards drug-resistant TB patients. This option is
not always available if the patient desires to keep his or her health status confidential.

20. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
Implementation of CPG is important as it helps in providing quality healthcare services based on
best available evidence applied to local scenario and expertise. Various factors and resource
implications should be considered for the success of the uptake in the CPG recommendations.
20.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors
The facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:
• availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and softcopies)
• regular conferences and updates on management of DR-TB
Limiting factors in the CPG implementation include:
• limited awareness in management and referral of DR-TB among healthcare providers
• inadequate DR-TB training at all levels of healthcare providers
• variation in DR-TB treatment at different levels of care due to administrative and financial
constraints
20.2 Potential Resource Implications
To implement the CPG, there must be strong commitments to:
• ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers via printed copies and online
accessibility
• reinforce training of healthcare providers via regular seminars and workshops
• involve multidisciplinary team at all levels
• improve the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities, and trained experts
• strengthen the DR-TBIS registry
To assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following is indicator for monitoring of DR-TB
control programme:
‘Treatment success rate, laboratory confirmed MDR-TB cases whom started 2nd line TB
treatment: 80%’. The formula is as below;
Implementation strategies will be developed following the approval of the CPG by MOH, which
include Quick Reference and Training Module.

Agent
Anti-TB Agent
Comments
Peripheral
neuropathy
d4T, ddI
Lzd, Cs, H,
aminoglycosides
Eto/Pto, E
Avoid use of d4T or ddI in
combination
with
Cs
or
Lzd
because of an increased risk of
peripheral neuropathy; If these
agents
must
be
used
in
combination
and
peripheral
neuropathy does develop, replace
antiretrovirals
with
a
less
neurotoxic agent. Patients taking H,
Cs
or
Lzd
should
receive
prophylactic pyridoxine.
Central
nervous
system (CNS)
toxicity
EFV
Cs, H, Eto/Pto, FQ
EFV has a high rate of CNS side
effects
(dizziness,
impaired
concentration,
depersonalization,
abnormal dreams, insomnia and
confusion) in the first 2–3 weeks of
use, but typically resolve on their
own. If these effects do not resolve,
consider substitution of the agent.
At present, there are limited data
on the use of EFV with Cs;
concurrent use is the accepted
practice as long as there is
frequent
monitoring
for
central
nervous system toxicity. Frank
psychosis can occur with Cs but is
rare with EFV alone; other causes
should always be ruled out.
Depression
EFV
Cs, FQ, H, Eto/ Pto
Severe depression can be seen in
2.4% of patients receiving EFV.
Consider substitution of EFV if
severe depression develops.
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)

Headache
AZT, EFV
Cs, Bdq
Rule out more serious causes of
headache,
such
as
bacterial
meningitis,
cryptococcal
meningitis, central nervous system
toxoplasmosis,
etc.
Use
of
analgesics
(ibuprofen,
paracetamol) and good hydration
may help.
Headaches secondary to AZT, EFV
and Cs are usually self-limited.
Nausea and
vomiting
RTV, d4T, NVP,
and most others
Eto/Pto, PAS, H,
Bdq, E, Z and
others
Persistent vomiting and abdominal
pain may be a result of developing
lactic acidosis (especially common
with long-term d4T use) and/or
hepatitis secondary to medications.
Abdominal
pain
All antiretrovirals
have been
associated with
abdominal pain
Eto/Pto, PAS
Abdominal pain is a common
adverse effect and often benign;
however, abdominal pain may be
an early symptom of severe side
effects,
such
as
pancreatitis,
hepatitis
or
lactic
acidosis
(especially common with long-term
d4T use.
Pancreatitis
d4T, ddI
Lzd
Avoid use of these agents together.
If an agent causes pancreatitis,
suspend it permanently and do
not use any of the potentially
pancreatitis-producing
antiretrovirals (d4T or ddI) in the
future.
Also
consider
gallstones
or
excessive alcohol use as potential
causes of pancreatitis.
Diarrhoea
All protease
inhibitors, ddI
(buffered
formulation)
Eto/Pto, PAS,
FQ
Diarrhoea is a common adverse
effect. Also consider opportunistic
infections as a cause of diarrhoea,
or
Clostridium
difficile
(pseudomembranous colitis).
Hepatotoxicity
NVP, EFV,
all protease
inhibitors (RTV
> others),
all NRTIs
H, R, E, Z, Bdq,
PAS, Eto/ Pto, FQ
Also see Section on hepatotoxicity
treatment related to second-line
anti-TB drugs. When severe, stop
both the ART and TB medications,
and restart the TB medications first.
(Also see Chapter 9 on managing
drug-induced hepatotoxicity).
Also consider co-trimoxazole as a
cause
of
hepatotoxicity
if
the
patient is receiving this medication.
Also rule out viral aetiologies as
cause of hepatitis (hepatitis A, B,
C, and CMV).

Lactic
acidosis
d4T, ddI, AZT,
3TC
Lzd
If
an
agent
has
caused
hyperlactataemia (i.e. high lactate)
or lactic acidosis, replace it with an
agent less likely to cause lactic
acidosis.
Note: the goal should always be
early detection and management of
hyperlactataemia
to
prevent
development of lactic acidosis.
Renal toxicity
TDF (rare)
Aminoglycosides,
Cm
TDF may cause renal injury with
the
characteristic
features
of
Fanconi
syndrome,
hypophosphataemia,
hypouricaemia,
proteinuria,
normoglycaemic glycosuria and, in
some cases, acute renal failure.
Avoid TDF in patients receiving
aminoglycosides or Cm. If TDF
is absolutely necessary, serum
creatinine
and
electrolytes
should be monitored frequently
(at least every two weeks).
Even without the concurrent use of
TDF, HIV-infected patients have an
increased risk of renal toxicity
secondary to aminoglycosides and
Cm.
Frequent
creatinine
and
electrolyte
monitoring
is
recommended.
In
the
presence
of
renal
insufficiency,
antiretrovirals
and
anti-TB medications need to have
their doses adjusted.
Electrolyte
disturbances
TDF (rare)
Cm,
aminoglycosides
Diarrhoea
and/or
vomiting
can
contribute
to
electrolyte
disturbances.
Even without the concurrent use
of TDF, HIV-infected patients have
an increased risk of both renal
toxicity and electrolyte disturbances
secondary to aminoglycosides
and Cm.
Bone marrow
suppression
AZT
Lzd, R, Rfb, H
Monitor blood counts regularly.
Replace AZT if bone marrow
suppression develops. Consider
suspension of Lzd.
Also consider co-trimoxazole as a
cause if the patient is receiving this
medication.
Consider
adding

Protease
inhibitors
Gfx, Eto/Pto
Protease inhibitors tend to cause

and
hyperglycaemia. Eto/Pto tends to
make insulin control in diabetics
more difficult, and can result in
hypoglycaemia and poor glucose
regulation.
Hypothyroidism

There is potential for overlying
toxicity, but evidence is mixed.
Several studies show subclinical
hypothyroidism
associated

Common adverse effects, the likely responsible anti-TB drugs and the suggested management strategies
Adverse effect
Suspected
agent(s)b
Suggested management strategies
Comments
Rash, allergic
reaction and
anaphylaxis
Any drug
1. For serious allergic reactions, stop all therapy
pending resolution of reaction.
2. Eliminate other potential causes of allergic
skin reactions.
3. For minor dermatologic reactions, various
agents may be helpful and allow continuation
of the medication. They include;
•
Antihistamines
•
Hydrocortisone cream for localized rash
Prednisone in a low dose of 10 to 20 mg
per day for several weeks can be tried if
other measures are not helpful.
•
Phototoxicity may respond to sunscreens,
but these can also cause rash.
•
Dry skin may cause itching, liberal use of
moisturizing lotion is recommended. Dry
skin is a common and significant problem
with clofazimine.
4. Once the rash resolves, reintroduce remaining
drugs, one at a time with the one most likely to
cause
the
reaction
last.
Consider
not
reintroducing even as a challenge any drug
that is highly likely to be the cause.
5. Suspend permanently any drug identified to be
the cause of a serious reaction.
1. History of previous drug allergies
should be carefully reviewed. Any
known drug allergies should be
noted on the treatment card.
2. Flushing reaction to rifampicin or
pyrazinamide is usually mild and
resolves with time. Antihistamines
can be used. Hot flushes, itching,
palpitations can be caused with
isoniazid and tyramine containing
foods (cheese, red wine). If this
occurs advise patients to avoid
foods that precipitate the reaction.
3. Any
drug
that
resulted
in
anaphylaxis or Stevens– Johnson
syndrome
should
never
be
reintroduced,
not
even
as
a
challenge.
Nausea and

2. Initiate a stepwise approach to manage
nausea and vomiting.
Phase 1: Adjust medications and
conditions without lowering the overall
dose:
-­‐
Give Eto/Pto at night
-­‐
Give Eto or PAS twice or thrice daily
-­‐
Give a light snack (biscuits, bread, rice,
tea) before the medications
-­‐
Give PAS two hours after other anti-TB
drugs.
Phase 2: Start antiemetic(s):
-­‐
Metoclopramide 10 mg, 30 minutes before
anti-TB medications.
-­‐
Ondansetron 8 mg, 30 minutes before the
anti-TB drugs and again eight hours after.
Ondansetron can either be used on its
own or with metoclopramide.
Phase 3: Decrease dose of the suspected
drug by one weight class if this can be done
without compromising the regimen.
may need to be tolerated at least in
the initial period.
2. Creatinine and electrolytes should
be checked if vomiting is severe.
Give intravenous fluids and replace
electrolytes as needed.
3. Another strategy is to stop the
responsible medicine for two or
three days and then add it back
gradually
increasing
the
dose
(advise
the
patient
that
the
medicine will be increased back to
a therapeutic dose in a manner that
will be better tolerated).

Gastritis and
abdominal
pain
PAS, Eto, Pto, Cfz,
FQs, H, E, and Z
1. Abdominal pain can also be associated with
serious adverse effects, such as pancreatitis,
lactic acidosis and hepatitis. If any of these
are suspected, obtain appropriate laboratory
tests to confirm and suspend the suspected
agent.
2. If symptoms are associated consistent with
gastritis (epigastric burning or discomfort, a
sour taste in mouth associated with reflux)
initiate medical therapy with the use of H2blockers or proton-pump inhibitors. Avoid the
use of antacids as they decrease absorption
of fluoroquinolones.
3. For severe abdominal pain stop suspected
agent(s) for short periods of time (one to
seven days).
4. Lower the dose of the suspected agent, if this
can be done without compromising the
regimen.
5. Discontinue the suspected agent if this can be
done without compromising the regimen.
1. If antacids must be used, they
should be carefully timed so as to
not interfere with the absorption of
fluoroquinolones (take two hours
before or three hours after anti-TB
drugs).
2. Stop
any
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs that patient
may be taking.
3. Diagnose
and
treat
for
Helicobacter pylori infections.
Diarrhoea and/
or flatulence
PAS, Eto/Pto
1. Encourage patients to tolerate some degree of
loose stools and flatulence.
2. Encourage fluid intake.
3. Treat uncomplicated diarrhoea (no blood in
stool and no fever) with loperamide 4 mg by
mouth initially followed by 2 mg after each
loose stool to a maximum of 10 mg per
24hours.
4. Check
serum
electrolytes
(especially
potassium) and dehydration status if diarrhoea
is severe.
5. Fever and diarrhoea and/or blood in the stools
indicate that diarrhoea may be secondary to
something other than the simple adverse
effect of anti-TB drugs.
1. Consider
other
causes
of
diarrhoea:
•
pseudo-membranous colitis related
to broad-spectrum antibiotics (such
as
the
fluoroquinolones)
is
a
serious and even life threatening
condition. Fever, bloody diarrhoea,
intense
abdominal
pain
and
increased white blood cells are
warning
signs
of
possible
pseudomembranous colitis.

Hepatitis
Z, H, R, Pto /
Eto, and PAS
1. If enzymes are more than five times the upper
limit of normal, stop all hepatotoxic drugs and
continue with at least three non hepatotoxic
medications (for example, the injectable agent,
fluoroquinolone and cycloserine). If hepatitis
worsens or does not resolve with the threedrug regimen, then stop all drugs.
2. Eliminate other potential causes of hepatitis
(viral hepatitis and alcohol induced hepatitis
being the two most common causes) and treat
any that is identified.
3. Consider suspending the most likely agent
permanently. Reintroduce remaining drugs,
one at a time with the least hepatotoxic agents
first, while monitoring liver function by testing
the enzymes every three days, and if the most
likely agent is not essential consider not
reintroducing it.
1. History of previous drug hepatitis
should be carefully analysed to
determine the most likely causative
agent(s); these drugs should be
avoided in future regimens.
2. Viral serology should be done to
rule
out
other
aetiologies
of
hepatitis if available, especially to
hepatitis A, B and C.
3. Alcohol use should be investigated
and alcoholism addressed.
4. Generally,
hepatitis
due
to
medications
resolves
upon
discontinuation of the suspected
drug.
Hypothyroidism
Eto/Pto, PAS
1. Most adults will require 100–150 mcg of
levothyroxine daily. Start levothyroxine in the
following manner:
•
Young healthy adults can be started on
75–100 mcg daily
•
Older patients should begin treatment with
50 mcg daily
•
Patients with significant cardiovascular
disease should start at 25 mcg daily.
2. Monitor TSH every one to two months and
increase the dose by 12.5–25 mcg until TSH
normalizes. Adjust the dose more slowly in the
elderly and in patients with cardiac conditions.
1. Symptoms
of
hypothyroidism
include fatigue, somnolence, cold
intolerance, dry skin, coarse hair,
and
constipation,
as
well
as
occasional depression and inability
to concentrate.
2. Do not start treatment unless TSH
is above 1.5– 2.0 times of the
upper normal limit.
3. It is completely reversible upon
discontinuation
of
PAS
and/or
ethionamide/ protionamide.
4. The combination of ethionamide/
protionamide with PAS is more
frequently
associated
with
hypothyroidism than when each
individual drug is used.

Arthralgia
Z, Bdq,
Fluoroquinolones
1. Initiate
therapy
with
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (indomethacin 50 mg
twice daily or ibuprofen 400 to 800 mg three
times a day).
2. Lower the dose of the suspected agent (most
commonly pyrazinamide) if this can be done
without compromising the regimen.
3. Discontinue the suspected agent if this can
be done without compromising the regimen.
1. Symptoms of arthralgia generally
diminish over time, even without
intervention.
2. Uric acid levels may be elevated in
patients on pyrazinamide. There is
little
evidence
to
support
the
addition
of
allopurinol
for
arthralgias, although if gout is
present it should be used.
3. If acute swelling, redness and
warmth are present in a joint,
consider aspiration for diagnosis of
gout,
infections,
autoimmune
diseases, etc.
Tendonitis and
tendon rupture
Fluoroquinolones 1. If significant inflammation of tendons or
tendon sheaths occur:
•
Consider stopping fluoroquinolones
•
Give a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (ibuprofen 400 mg four times daily)
•
Rest the joint.
2. If treatment failure is likely without the
fluoroquinolone
•
Reduce dose if possible
•
Ensure joint is strictly rested
•
Inform patient of the possible risk of
tendon rupture and discuss the risks and
benefits
of
ongoing
use
of
the
fluoroquinolone.
1. Tendon
rupture
with
fluoroquinolone use is more likely in
patients
doing
new
physical
activities and more common among
older patients and diabetics.
2. Tendon rupture is relatively rare in
patients on MDR-TB regimens with
fluoroquinolones.
Electrolyte

potassium
is
low,
also
check
for

Nephrotoxicity
(renal toxicity)
S, Km, Am, Cm
1. Discontinue the suspected agent.
2. Consider
using
capreomycin
if
an
aminoglycoside had been the prior injectable
drug in the regimen.
3. Consider other contributing aetiologies and
address as indicated.
4. Follow creatinine (and electrolyte) levels
closely, every one to two weeks.
5. Consider dosing the injectable agent two to
three times a week if the drug is essential to
the regimen and the patient can tolerate. If the
creatinine continues to rise despite twice/thrice
a week dosing, suspend the injectable agent.
6. Adjust all TB medications according to the
creatinine clearance.
1. History of diabetes or renal disease
is not a contraindication to the use
of agents listed here, although
patients with these comorbidities
may be at increased risk for
developing renal failure.
2. Renal
impairment
may
be
permanent.
Vestibular
toxicity
(tinnitus and
dizziness)
S, Km, Am, Cm,
Cs, FQs, H Eto,
Lzd
1. If early symptoms of vestibular toxicity appear,
change the dosing of the injectable agent to
twice/thrice a week. Also, consider using
capreomycin if an aminoglycoside had been
the prior injectable in the regimen.
2. If tinnitus and unsteadiness worsen with the
above adjustment, stop the injectable agent.
This is one of the few adverse reactions that
cause permanent intolerable toxicity and can
necessitate discontinuation of a class of
agents.
1. Ask the patient about tinnitus and
unsteadiness every week.
2. Fullness in the ears and intermittent
ringing are early symptoms of
vestibular toxicity.
3. A degree of disequilibrium can be
caused by Cs, FQs, Eto/Pto, INH or
linezolid. Some clinicians will stop
all drugs for several days to see if
symptoms are attributed to these
drugs.
Symptoms
of
vestibular
toxicity generally do not improve on
withholding medications.
Hearing loss
(also see
vestibular
toxicity above)
S, Km, Am, Cm, Clr
1. Document hearing loss and compare with
baseline
audiogram
if
available.
(Some
degree of hearing loss occurs with most
patients starting with high frequency loss.)
2. If early symptoms of hearing loss are
documented, change the dosing of the
injectable agent to twice/thrice a week. Also,
consider
using
capreomycin
if
an

despite hearing loss almost always
results in irreversible deafness.
Peripheral
neuropathy
Cs, Lzd, H, S, Km,
Amk, Cm, H,
Fluoroquinolones,
rarely Pto/Eto, E
1. Correct any vitamin or nutritional deficiencies.
Increase pyridoxine to the maximum daily
dose (200 mg per day).
2. Consider whether the dose of cycloserine can
be
reduced
without
compromising
the
regimen. If isoniazid is being used (especially
high dose isoniazid), consider stopping it. If
possible, switching the aminoglycoside to
capreomycin may also be helpful.
3. Initiate
medical
therapy
for
example
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
or
acetaminophen,
tricyclic
antidepressants,
carbamazepine or gabapentin can be used.
4. Rarely, medication may be discontinued, but
only if an alternative drug is available and the
regimen is not compromised.
1. Patients with comorbid disease
(e.g.
diabetes,
HIV,
alcohol
dependence) may be more likely to
develop peripheral neuropathy.
2. Neuropathy may be irreversible but
many
patients
experience
improvement when the offending
agents are suspended.
3. The neuropathy associated with
linezolid is common after prolonged
use and often permanent. For this
reason, suspension of this drug
should
be
strongly
considered
when neuropathy develops due to
linezolid.
Headache
Cs, Bdq,
Rule out more serious causes of headache
including meningitis, and other infections of the
central nervous system. (HIV coinfected patients
should receive a head computed tomography
scan and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.)
Start analgesics like ibuprofen or paracetamol.
1. Headaches are common during the
initial months of MDR-TB therapy.
They can present as migraine or
cluster headaches.
2. To minimize headaches at the start
of therapy, cycloserine can be
started at lower doses of 250– 500
mg and gradually increased over
one to two weeks to achieve the
target dose.
3. Headaches due to cycloserine and
bedaquiline are usually self-limited.

underlying
socioeconomic issues
2. Assess patients for coexisting substance
abuse and refer to treatment if appropriate.
3. Initiate
individual
counselling
(or
group
counselling if the patient is sputum smear and
culture negative).
4. When depression is more significant, initiate
antidepressant therapy.
5. Lower the dose of the suspected agent if this
can be done without compromising the
regimen.
6. Discontinue the suspected agent if this can be
done without compromising the regimen.
1. Socioeconomic
conditions
and
chronic
illness
should
not
be
underestimated
as
contributing
factors to depression.
2. Depressive
symptoms
may
fluctuate during therapy and may
improve as illness is successfully
treated.
3. History of previous depression is
not a contraindication to the use of
agents listed but may increase the
likelihood of depression developing
during
treatment.
If
significant
depression is present at the start of
treatment, avoid a regimen with
cycloserine, if possible.
4. Question
the
patient
regarding
suicidal ideation any time the
depression is judged to be more
than mild.
Suicidal
ideation
CS, H, Eto/Pto
1. Hospitalize the patient and put under 24-hour
surveillance.
2. Discontinue cycloserine.
3. Request psychiatric consultation.
4. nitiate antidepressant therapy.
5. Lower the dose of Eto/Pto to 500 mg daily
until the patient is stable.
1. Keep the patient in the hospital
until risk of suicide has passed.
2. If no improvement occurs after
holding cycloserine, hold H and/or
Eto/Pto.
Psychotic
symptoms
Cs, H,
fluoroquinolones
1. Stop the suspected agent for a short period of
time (1–4 weeks) while psychotic symptoms
are brought under control. The most likely
drug is cycloserine followed by high dose
isonizaid.
2. If moderate to severe symptoms persist,
initiate antipsychotic therapy (haloperidol).
3. Hospitalize in a ward with psychiatric expertise
1. Some patients will need to continue
antipsychotic treatment throughout

treatment
(and
discontinued upon completion of
treatment).
2. Previous

5. Lower the dose of the suspected agent (most
commonly cycloserine to 500 mg a day) if this
can be done without compromising the
regimen.
6. Discontinue the suspected agent if this can be
done without compromising the regimen.
7. Once all symptoms resolve and patient is off
cycloserine, antipsychotic therapy can be
tapered off. If cycloserine iscontinued at a
lower dose, antipsychotic therapy may need to
be continued and any attempts of tapering off
should be done after referring to a psychiatrist
trained in the adverse effects of second-line
anti-TB drugs.
increase the likelihood of psychotic
symptoms
developing
during
treatment.
3. Some
patients
will
tolerate
cycloserine with an antipsychotic
drug but this should be done in
consultation with a psychiatrist, as
these patients will need to be under
special observation; this should
only be done when there is no
other alternative.
4. Psychotic symptoms are generally
reversible
upon
completion
of
MDR-TB treatment or cessation of
the offending agent.
5. Always check creatinine in patients
with
new
onset
psychosis.
A
decrease in renal function can
result in high blood levels of
cycloserine,
which
can
cause
psychosis.
Seizures
Cs, H,
fluoro-quinolones
1. Hold
cycloserine,
fluoroquinolones
and
isoniazid pending resolution of seizures.
2. Initiate
anticonvulsant
therapy
(carbamazepine, phenytoin or valproic acid
are most commonly used).
3. Increase pyridoxine to the maximum daily
dose (200 mg per day).
4. Check serum electrolytes including potassium,
sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium and
chloride.
5. When
seizures
have
resolved,
restart
medications one at a time. Cycloserine should
not be restarted unless itis absolutely essential
to the regimen. If cycloserine is reinitiated,
start a dose one weight band lower.
1. An

QT
prolongation
Bdq,
fluoroquinolones,
clarithromycin
clofazimine
Any patient found to have a QTc value greater
than 500 ms should be managed carefully.
•
Repeat ECG and confirm the prolongation.
•
Bedaquiline should be stopped for QTc value
greater than 500 ms. Consider stopping other
drugs that prolong the QT interval.
•
Check potassium, calcium and magnesium
levels.
Electrolyte levels should be maintained in the
normal range.
•
It is suggested to maintain potassium levels of
more than 4 mEq/l and magnesium levels of
more than 1.8 mg/dl.
•
Avoid other drugs that increase the QT
interval.
Monitor the patient’s renal and hepatic function
and adjust the dose of fluoroquinolones if
impairment is present.
Consider suspension of fluoroquinolone if risk of
torsades de pointes outweighs the benefits of the
drug.
1. The QT interval is measured from
the end of the QRS complex to the
beginning of the T wave on a
standard ECG. The QT is corrected
for heart rate, which is referred to
as the QTc and calculated by most
ECG machines. A normal QTc is
generally <440 ms.
2. Values above QTc 440 ms are
referred to as prolonged. Patients
with prolonged QTc are at risk for
developing cardiac arrhythmias like
torsades de pointes, which can be
life threatening. Patients with QTc
greater than 500 ms are at the
greatest risk for developing these
arrhythmias.

APPENDIX 8
Definition of DRTB indicators
1. DETECTION INDICATORS
Definition
1.1 TB patients with result for
isoniazid and rifampicin
DST
Numerator: Number of TB cases with DST result for
both isoniazid and rifampicin by each risk category
specified in the national policy during the period of
assessment.
Denominator: Number of TB cases identified in each
respective
risk
category
during
the
period
of
assessment.
1.2 Confirmed MDR-TB cases
detected among TB
patients tested for
susceptibility to isoniazid
and rifampicin
Numerator: Number of confirmed MDR-TB cases by
each risk category specified in the national policy during
the period of assessment.
Denominator: Number of TB cases in each risk
category with DST result for both isoniazid and
rifampicin during the period of assessment.
1.3 Confirmed MDR-TB cases
tested for susceptibility to
any fluoroquinolone and
any second-line injectable
drug
Numerator: Number of confirmed MDR-TB cases tested
for susceptibility to a fluoroquinolone and a second-line
injectable anti-TB medication during the period of
assessment.
Denominator: Number of confirmed MDR-TB cases
during the period of assessment
1.4 Confirmed XDR-TB cases
detected among MDR-TB
patients tested for
susceptibility to any
fluoroquinolone and any
second-line injectable drug
Numerator: Number of confirmed XDR-TB cases
detected during the period of assessment.
Denominator: Number of confirmed MDR-TB cases
tested for susceptibility to a fluoroquinolone and a
second-line injectable anti-TB medication during the
period of assessment.
1.5 Interval between
presumption of RR-/MDRTB and DST results
The duration in days between the date when the TB
patient was identified as being in a risk category as per
the national policy and the dates of the DST results for
isoniazid and rifampicin as recorded in the Laboratory
register. The first date is determined by type of risk
category. This date may correspond to when TB is
diagnosed if universal DST is practised, or when a
laboratory result indicates treatment failure or persistent
sputum smear positivity during the course of TB
treatment, or when HIV-associated TB is detected. In the
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)

case of a contact with TB, this would be when the
laboratory confirms MDR in the source case, which may
precede or occur after the diagnosis of TB in the contact
(information as in the Laboratory register). In sites
testing with Xpert MTB/RIF alone, the indicator can be
modified to include all cases with a rifampicin test result
and the date of the first result showing rifampicin
resistance is used, regardless of whether the same
patient
was
confirmed
to
be
MDR-TB
or
not
subsequently. The calculation is done on all cases with
DST results for isoniazid and rifampicin (sensitive or
resistant) entered in the Laboratory register during the
six-month period of assessment. The difference in days
between the two dates is summed up for all patients and
divided by the number of cases with test results. The
indicator is expressed as the arithmetic mean number of
days with the minimum and maximum ranges for the
episodes included in the calculation. The number of
episodes included in the calculation should be indicated.
2. ENROLMENT INDICATORS
2.1 RR-/MDR-TB cases
(presumptive or confirmed)
enrolled on MDR-TB
treatment
Number
of
RR-/MDR-TB
cases
(presumptive
or
confirmed) registered and started on a prescribed MDRTB treatment regimen during the period of assessment.
Comparator:
Number
of
RR-/MDR-TB
cases
(presumptive or confirmed) eligible for second-line drugs
treatment during the period of assessment.
2.2 Confirmed RR-/MDR-TB
cases enrolled on MDR-TB
treatment regimen
Number of confirmed MDR-TB cases registered and
started on a prescribed MDR-TB treatment regimen
during the period of assessment.
Comparator: Number of confirmed MDR-TB cases
detected during the period of assessment.
2.3 Confirmed XDR-TB cases
enrolled on XDR-TB
treatment regimen
Number of confirmed XDR-TB cases registered and
started on a prescribed XDR-TB treatment regimen
during the period of assessment.
Comparator: Number of confirmed XDR-TB cases
detected during the period of assessment.
2.4 Interval between RR-/MDRTB diagnosis and start of
MDR-TB treatment
The duration in days between the date of RR-/MDR-TB
confirmation (DST results showing resistance to both
isoniazid and rifampicin in the Laboratory register) and
the date when the patient started a prescribed secondline drug regimen as per the Second-line TB treatment
register; in sites testing with Xpert MTB/RIF alone, the
Management of DR-TB (First Edition)

indicator is modified to include all confirmed RR-TB
cases and the date of the first result showing rifampicin
resistance is used regardless of whether the same
patient was confirmed with MDR-TB or not subsequently
(i.e. the date when the patient was first found to be
eligible for a MDR-TB regimen). The calculation is done
on all confirmed RR-/MDR-TB cases recorded on the
Second-line TB treatment register during the six-month
period of assessment. The difference in days between
the date of confirmation and start of treatment is
summed up for all patients and divided by the number of
treatment episodes. The indicator is expressed as the
arithmetic mean number of days with the minimum and
maximum ranges for all episodes included in the
calculation.
If
treatment
was
started
before
the
confirmatory DST was reported then the interval is
marked as zero days. The number of episodes included
in the calculation should be indicated.
3. INTERIM RESULTS
INDICATORS
3.1 RR-/MDR-TB cases on
MDR-TB treatment regimen
with negative culture by six
months
Numerator: Number of confirmed pulmonary RR-/MDRTB cases registered and started on a prescribed MDRTB treatment with negative results for culture in month
six of their treatment.
