STATEMENT OF INTENT
This guideline was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice, based on the
best available evidence at the time of development. Specific attempts were made
to use local data and publications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this
guideline does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient
care. Every healthcare provider is responsible for the management of his/her unique
patient based on the clinical presentation and management options available locally.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE
This guideline is issued in 2019 and will be reviewed in 2024 or earlier if important
new evidence becomes available.

MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH
The 1st Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction
(STEMI) was published in 2001 with a 2nd and 3rd update in 2007 and 2014
respectively. Rapid developments have taken place, especially in the area of
pre-hospital care. This 4th edition was developed to provide a clear and concise
approach based on current evidence with the focus being on efforts to reduce
the time from first medical contact, improve pre-hospital care as well support the
application of guideline-directed therapies.
This CPG has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the National
Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The committee
members were multidisciplinary and comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine,
family medicine, rehabilitation and emergency physicians from the government,
private sector and universities. Relevant clinical trial data and published literature
have been summarized and adapted to local practices. This guideline also
implemented the work of our very own national STEMI network which links non-PCIcapable centres to PCI-capable centres so PCI services can be arranged in a timely
manner for all patients.
Ischaemic heart disease has been a significant burden to this country, and it
is projected that the burden will continue to increase with the rising number of
cardiovascular risk factors and an ageing population. I believe this CPG will be an
invaluable guiding document for healthcare providers involved in the management of
STEMI and subsequently be translated to an improved clinical outcome for patients
suffering from ischaemic heart disease.

RATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT
Rationale
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) continues to be a major cause of morbidity
and mortality in Malaysia. With timely intervention and early reperfusion, the
cardiovascular outcomes have improved. The biggest challenge has been to reduce
the total ischaemic time, which is the time from onset of chest pain till the time when
the infarct related artery is opened. A large portion of this delay has been the late
presentation of the patient with AMI to medical attention (onset of chest pain to First
Medical Contact – FMC).
The 1st Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction
(STEMI) was published in 2001 with a 2nd and 3rd update in 2007 and 2014
respectively. Rapid further developments have taken place especially in the area
of pre-hospital care. This 4th edition was developed to provide a clear and concise
approach based on current evidence with the focus being on efforts to reduce time
to FMC and improve pre-hospital care. We have summarised and adapted relevant
clinical trial data and published literature to the local practice.
This CPG has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the National
Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The committee
members were multidisciplinary and comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine,
family medicine, rehabilitation and emergency physicians from the government,
private sector and universities. The external reviewers were also multidisciplinary
and in addition to specialists, general practitioners were also included. Patient and
carer groups were however not included as external reviewers.
Objectives
These guidelines are intended to provide awareness and education in order to
reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with STEMI by:
• Reducing total ischaemic time
• Developing a network for early referral and treatment of STEMI patients
• Updating the management of STEMI with respect to:
 Diagnosis
 Management
 Secondary prevention

Process
A review of current medical literature on AMI/STEMI since the publication of the last
CPG on 30th Sept 2013 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the
following electronic databases – PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews. The search was conducted for the period 1st September 2013 till 31st
August 2018. The following MeSH terms or free text terms were used either singly
or in combination:
“Myocardial infarction (MI)”; “STEMI”; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction;” “definition
of MI”; “Myocardial injury”, “ECG criteria of STEMI”, “Pre-hospital Management
of STEMI”; “STEMI Networks”; “Pre-hospital thrombolysis”; “Fibrinolysis”;
“Primary PCI”; “Reperfusion strategies in STEMI”; “Pharmaco-invasive strategy”;
“Pharmacotherapy in STEMI”; “Oxygen therapy in MI”; “Complications post STEMI”,
“cardiogenic shock”; “Heart Failure post STEMI”; “Risk stratification scores in
STEMI”; “Cardiac rehabilitation”, “second prevention post STEMI”, “management of
STEMI in women, the elderly, persons with diabetes and in those with chronic renal
disease.”
The search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and published
in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge
list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to
identify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the field were also
contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines mainly that from the
American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main references.
All literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all
statements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The
grading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted
from the AHA/ACC and the ESC (pg 14).
After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical
Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health
personnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector for review and
feedback.

Clinical Questions Addressed:
There were several topics and subtopics that were formulated addressing the
diagnosis and management of STEMI.
For diagnosis: In a person presenting with chest pain:
• What features in the history would make one suspect this patient is having a
myocardial infarction (MI)?
• Which ECG features would make one suspect this patient is having a MI?
• Which cardiac biomarkers would help confirm a diagnosis of MI early and with
accepted sensitivity and specificity?
For therapy, the topics and subtopics were formulated using the PICO method as
follows:
P: Population- Persons with ST elevation MI and:
• Duration of chest pain:
 <1 hour
 <3 hours
 3 - <12 hours
 12-24 hours
h With ongoing symptoms and signs of ischaemia
h With haemodynamic instability
h Without ongoing ischaemia or haemodynamic instability
• Atrial Fibrillation
• Older persons
• Persons with diabetes
• Women
• Chronic Kidney disease
 Not on renal replacement therapy
 On renal replacement therapy
I: Intervention:
• Reperfusion strategy:
 Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)
 Fibrinolytic therapy
h Pre-hospital thrombolysis vs in-hospital thrombolysis
 Pharmaco-invasive PCI
• Concomitant drug therapy
 Anti-platelet therapy
 Direct oral anti-coagulant (DOAC)
 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I),
 Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL

 ß-blockers
 Mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRA)
 Statins
C: Comparison:
• Reperfusion vs no reperfusion
• Fibrinolytic therapy vs primary PCI vs pharmaco-invasive PCI
• Single anti-platelet therapy vs dual anti-platelet therapy
• Clopidogrel vs prasugrel vs ticagrelor as second anti-platelet agent
• ACE-I vs no ACE-I
O: Outcome:
• Reduction in major cardiovascular disease event rate (MI, heart failure, stroke,
cardiovascular (CV) death)
• Reduction in all-cause mortality
Type of Question- Involves:
• Therapy - Reperfusion strategy, concomitant drug therapy
• Harm –
 Increase in cardiovascular event rate (MI, heart failure, CV death)
 Increase in bleeding risk and stroke rate
 Adverse effects due pharmacotherapy
• Prognosis – Reduction in MI, heart failure, CV death and improvement in all-cause
mortality
Type of Study
• Systematic review and meta-analysis
• Randomised controlled studies
• Cohort studies
Thus, there were numerous clinical questions formulated.
Eg of some of these Clinical Questions:
• In a person with STEMI presenting within the first hour of chest pain, is a
reperfusion strategy with fibrinolytic therapy superior to Primary PCI leading to a
reduction in rate of MI, stroke, heart failure and CV death?
• In a person with STEMI presenting within < 3 hours of chest pain, is a reperfusion
strategy with fibrinolytic therapy superior to primary PCI leading to a reduction in
rate of MI, stroke, heart failure and CV death?
• In a person with STEMI having undergone a reperfusion strategy with fibrinolytic
therapy, is concomitant single anti-platelet therapy with aspirin alone superior to
DAPT leading to a reduction in rate of MI, stroke, heart failure and CV death?
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019

• In a person with STEMI having undergone a reperfusion strategy with primary PCI,
does ACE-I therapy provide additional value in the reduction of MI, stroke, heart
failure and CV death?
• In a person with STEMI having undergone a reperfusion strategy with fibrinolytic
therapy, would PCI provide additional value in the reduction of MI, stroke, heart
failure and CV death?
• In a person with STEMI presenting within 3 -12 hours of chest pain and with
chronic kidney disease and on renal replacement therapy, is a reperfusion strategy
with fibrinolytic therapy superior to primary PCI leading to a reduction in rate of MI,
stroke, heart failure and CV death?
Target Group:
These guidelines are developed for all healthcare providers involved in the
management of STEMI in adults.
Target Population:
These guidelines are developed to treat all adults with STEMI.
Period of Validity of the Guidelines:
These guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with
recent developments and knowledge that is being learnt.
Applicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:
This guideline was developed taking into account our local healthcare resources. At
present fibrinolytic therapy is available at most government hospitals while facilities
for both fibrinolysis and PCI are present in the cardiac centres. STEMI networks have
been established and are still being developed in the Klang Valley and other states/
regions of the country.
The drugs used for secondary prevention – aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, ACE-I,
ß-blockers, spironolactone – are all available in the government formulary in almost
all public hospitals as generics.
This guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimise
existing resources in the timely management of patients with STEMI.

Facilitators and Barriers:
The major barriers for the successful implementation of this CPG is the financial and
resource implications of:
• transporting these patients to PCI capable centres quickly using well-equipped
ambulances and accompanied by trained pre-hospital care personnel or medical
officers
• availability of PCI centres providing 24/7 service
• PCI - costs of catheters and stents
Implementation of the Guidelines:
The implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical
governance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:
• Increasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the
importance of seeking early medical attention when they have chest pains and
chest pain equivalents.
• Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the
importance of timely reperfusion and appropriate management of patients with
STEMI. This can be done by road shows, electronic media, and in-house training
sessions.
Clinical audit by individual hospitals and units to ensure compliance using the
suggested performance measures in Section 17, pg. 113.

WHAT’S NEW IN THE CURRENT GUIDELINES
Previous CPG STEMI (2014)
Current CPG STEMI (2019)
Distinguishing the
difference between
myocardial injury
and Myocardial
Infarction (MI) -
Recognition that all
myocardial injury is
not necessarily due
to MI.
No clear differentiation
between myocardial injury
and MI
Myocardial injury is reflected by
a troponin level above the 99th
percentile of upper reference limit
(URL). Myocardial injury may be
due to:
• Ischaemia
• Non-ischemic causes
MI is myocardial injury due to
ischaemia.
STEMI is MI with ST elevation
seen on the resting ECG.
Pre-hospital Care
(PHC)/personnel
Brief statement about Prehospital Care/personnel
• Providing a structured format of
response to an emergency call
for “chest pain.”
• To treat STEMI promptly
preferably by Primary PCI by
transporting the patient directly
to a PCI capable hospital.
• Outlining key care processes to
shorten door to balloon (device)
time (DBT) and improve quality
of care during transport.
• Encouraging pre-hospital
thrombolysis if transport time
to a PCI capable centre is
long and trained doctor/PHC
personnel are available. If this
is not available, for in-hospital
thrombolysis at the nearest
hospital.
• Identifying training of PHC
personnel as an important
priority.

 FMC at non-PCI (spoke)
hospital: DBT: < 120 minutes
h Door in Door Out (DIDO):
< 30 minutes.
h Transfer to PCI capable
centre: < 60 minutes.
• For fibrinolysis:
 FMC to thrombolysis < 30
minutes (this could be inhospital or pre-hospital in an
ambulance equipped with the
necessary facilities)
Diagnosing
reinfarctionTroponins can
also be used for
reinfarction
In a patient with recurrent
chest pain following
STEMI, a ≥ 20% increase
in the value of Creatine
Kinase-Myocardial
Band (CKMB) from the
last sample suggests
reinfarction.
If a patient is suspected of having
a reinfarction on clinical grounds,
a ≥20% increase in the value of
either troponins or CKMB between
2 samples 3-6 hours apart
supports the diagnosis
Fibrinolysis
If the time from STEMI diagnosis
to wire crossing is more than 120
minutes, then pre-hospital or
nearest in-hospital fibrinolysis is
an option. Then consider transfer
for a pharmaco-invasive strategy.

SUMMARY
Key Message #1: -Epidemiology of STEMI
• From the latest report of the National Cardiovascular Database - Acute Coronary
Syndrome (NCVD-ACS) Registry 2014-2015:
 The STEMI mortality in Malaysia remains high- the in-hospital, 30-day and
1-year mortality following STEMI being 10.6%, 12.3% and 17.9% respectively.
 Patients receiving reperfusion (Primary PCI or fibrinolytic) had better survival
compared to patients who did not receive any reperfusion.
 Patients who had PCI during the index hospitalisation (including those who
underwent Primary PCI and PCI both fibrinolysis) had better short-term and
long-term survival as compared to those who did not undergo in-hospital PCI.
This data is consistent with other published registries.
Key Message #2: - Diagnosis of STEMI
• Myocardial Infarction (MI) is defined pathologically as myocardial cell death due
to prolonged ischaemia.
 It is diagnosed by the rise and/or fall in cardiac troponins, with at least one value
above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limits (URL), and accompanied
with at least one of the following:
i. Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin.
ii. New ischaemic ECG changes or development of pathological Q waves.
iii. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall
motion abnormality.
iv. Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
• MI may be due to STEMI or Non ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTEACS).
• STEMI is diagnosed when there is:
 ST elevation of ≥1 mm in 2 contiguous leads or
 a new onset LBBB in the resting ECG
 in a patient with ischaemic type chest pains of > 30 minutes and
 accompanied by a rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers. (Table 6, pg 48 for ECG
diagnosis of STEMI)
• New onset Right Bundle Branch Block with ST elevation of ≥1 mm in 2 contiguous
leads does not interfere with the diagnosis of STEMI.
• Patients having prolonged ischaemic type chest pain of > 30 minutes and having:
 a normal ECG or ST segment depression may be having NSTE-ACS. This
encompasses both Unstable Angina (UA) and Non -ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI).
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
24
 a non-interpretable resting ECG (eg paced rhythm, RBBB etc) may be having
NSTE-ACS. If pain persists, these high-risk patients may be considered for early
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) if facilities are available. Fibrinolysis
is not advisable.
 There are separate guidelines for NSTE-ACS.
Key Message #3: - Clinical Presentation and Pitfalls in Diagnosis
• Atypical presentations can occur in the elderly, women and in diabetic persons.
• If the initial ECG is non-diagnostic, it may need to be repeated at frequent intervals
to detect evolving changes of STEMI. Additional chest leads (V 7-9) and right
ventricular leads may also be helpful.
• Too early a measurement of the cardiac biomarkers can sometimes result in
misleadingly low levels.
Key Message #4: - Pre-Hospital Management:
• The public and Pre-hospital Care (PHC) personnel should be educated on the
importance of early diagnosis and the benefits of early treatment.
• Patients with suspected STEMI should be given soluble or chewable 300 mg
aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel.
• These patients should be rapidly transported to the hospital for early initiation of
reperfusion strategies.
Key Message #5: - STEMI Network:
• The objective of a STEMI network is to link non-PCI-capable centres to PCIcapable centres with the aim of providing PCI services in a timely manner for
patients:
 With STEMI
 Who have been given fibrinolytic therapy and:
h have failed reperfusion, or;
h as part of a pharmaco-invasive strategy, or;
h have high-risk features requiring early intervention.
• The optimal treatment of these patients should be based on the implementation
of networks between hospitals (‘hub’ and ‘spoke’) and linked by an efficient
ambulance service.
Key Message #6: - Initial Management:
• Early management of STEMI is directed at:
 Pain relief.
 Establishing early reperfusion.
 Treatment of complications.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
25
Key Message #7: - Reperfusion Strategies:
“Time is muscle” - Every patient with STEMI should have the occluded artery
reopened (reperfusion therapy) as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms.
• Reperfusion therapy is indicated in all patients with symptoms of ischaemia of <12
hours duration and persistent ST-segment elevation.
• Primary PCI is superior to fibrinolysis for STEMI when performed in a timely
manner at experienced centres. (see Flow Charts 1 & 2, pg 33 & 34)
 If the patient presents at a PCI centre, then the time from FMC (First Medical
Contact) to wire crossing should be ≤ 90 minutes.
 If transferred from a centre with no PCI facilities, the time from FMC to wire
crossing should be ≤ 120 minutes (including transfer delay). This is made up of:
h door-in-door-out (DIDO) of non–PCI-capable hospital (spoke): ≤ 30 minutes.
h Transport time to PCI -capable centre (hub): ≤ 60 minutes.
h Door of PCI capable centre to wire crossing: ≤ 30 minutes.
h If the time delay to primary PCI is >120 minutes, the best option is to give
fibrinolytic therapy and make arrangements to transfer the patient to a PCI
capable centre for a pharmaco-invasive strategy.
• When fibrinolytic therapy is administered, the Door to Needle time (DNT) should
be ≤ 30 minutes.
• Whenever possible, patients given fibrinolytic therapy should be considered
for a pharmaco-invasive approach (elective angiogram within 3-24 hours post
fibrinolysis).
Key Message #8: - Adjunctive Therapies:
• All patients with STEMI receiving fibrinolytic therapy should receive:
 300 mg aspirin
+ (Plus) loading dose
h 75 mg of clopidogrel (> 75 years of age) or
h 300 mg clopidogrel (≤75 years of age)
 followed by a maintenance dose of 75-150 mg daily of aspirin long-term and
75 mg of clopidogrel daily. The duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
should be between 1 month to 1 year, the duration being a balance between
the ischaemic risks vs the bleeding risks.
• All patients with STEMI undergoing Primary PCI should receive loading doses of:
 300 mg aspirin
+ (Plus)
h 300-600 mg clopidogrel or
h 180 mg ticagrelor or
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
26
h 60 mg prasugrel (after the coronary angiogram)
 This is followed by a maintenance dose of 75-150 mg daily of aspirin longterm and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily or 90 mg twice daily ticagrelor or 10 mg
prasugrel daily.
 Patients who underwent PCI require DAPT for up to a year depending on the
thrombotic/ischaemic versus bleeding risks. In patients with high bleeding
risks, a shorter period of DAPT of 6 months may be considered.
• Medications that have been shown to improve survival if given early are:
 ACE-Is
 ARBs if ACE-I intolerant
 ß -blockers
 Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRA)
 High dose statins.
Key Message #9: - Complications Post STEMI:
• Important complications following STEMI are arrhythmias and heart failure.
• Heart failure may be due to extensive myocardial damage or mechanical
complications.
• Chest pain post STEMI may be due to:
 Reinfarction/Recurrent MI
 Post infarct angina
 Pericarditis
 Non-cardiac causes such as gastritis
Key Message #10: - Risk Stratification Post STEMI:
• All patients post-STEMI should be risk-stratified either clinically or by using the
STEMI TIMI and/or GRACE risk scores (pages 120-122).
• High-risk patients should be referred to cardiology centres for early coronary
angiography and revascularization.
Key Message #11: - Secondary Prevention:
• Secondary prevention interventions can reduce mortality and cardiovascular
event rate post-STEMI. This includes:
 smoking cessation and other lifestyle changes
 regular exercise
 control of CV risk factors- hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidaemia
 drug therapy;

h anti-platelet agents
h statins therapy
h ß-blockers:
◊ < 1 year in all patients
◊ > 1 year in the presence of LVEF ≤ 40%
h ACE-I/ARB:
◊ < 1 year in all patients
◊ > 1 year in the presence of LVEF ≤ 40%, anterior infarct and diabetes
• Healthcare providers should provide patient education and encourage compliance.
• Cardiac rehabilitation is an integral component of secondary prevention.
Key Message #12: - STEMI in Special Groups:
• Diagnosis of STEMI in older patients, persons with diabetes and women is difficult
and a high index of suspicion is important.
• Treatment is the same although the older population and women tend to have
higher bleeding risk.
• In patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):
 Treatment of STEMI should be individualised.
 Primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy but morbidity and mortality are
high.
 In view of bleeding risks, the dosages of anti-platelet agents and antithrombotics need to be adjusted accordingly.
 Aspirin, ß- blockers, ACE-I and statins are beneficial in patients with mild to
moderate CKD. In patients on dialysis, only aspirin, ß- blockers and ACE-I
remain beneficial.
Key Message #13:- Resumption of driving:
• There is no unanimous consensus as when to resume driving after STEMI.
• In general, for:
 Private drivers:
h After one month if no complications and LVEF >35%.
h In those with complications such as LVEF <35%, acute decompensated
heart failure, arrhythmias etc- it may be longer.
 Commercial drivers:
h should be assessed at 3 months post-STEMI for fitness to resume duties.
• For fitness for commercial air travel, see Table 16, pg 111.

Key Recommendation 2:
• In all patients presenting with chest pain or chest pain equivalents, a 12 lead
ECG should be done and interpreted < 10 min of the First Medical Contact
(FMC).
• If the initial ECG is non diagnostic and the index of suspicion of STEMI is
high:
 the ECG should be repeated at close intervals of at least 15 minutes to
look for progressive ST changes.
 compared with previous ECG’s.
 additional chest leads (V 7-9) and right ventricular leads should be done to
identify posterior and right ventricular infarcts.

aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel.
• These patients should be rapidly transported to the hospital for early initiation
of reperfusion strategies.
• If the anticipated time from FMC to PCI mediated reperfusion (wire crossing
the lesion) is > 120 minutes, then pre-hospital or nearest in-hospital
fibrinolysis is an option.

1. INTRODUCTION
The most recent data from the National Department of Statistics Malaysia indicated
that in 2014, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was the principal cause of mortality
(13.7%). For men, it was the principle cause of death (15.2%) and for women, it was
second after pneumonias.1
Most deaths in STEMI occur within the first hour due to fatal arrhythmias. In addition,
TIME LOST IS MYOCARDIUM LOST. Thus, early diagnosis and prompt reperfusion
is important.
Based on the latest Malaysian Annual Report of the National Cardiovascular
Database- Acute Coronary Syndrome (NCVD-ACS) Registry 2014-2015 it was noted
that:2
• The demographics of patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) have not
changed over the last 10 years.
 They are young with a mean age of 58.6 years, and about a quarter are below
the age of 50 years. This age is lower than that seen in Thailand, Singapore and
in Western populations.3-5 The patients presenting with ST segment Elevation
Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) are even younger with a mean age of 56 years.
 Majority of men presented with STEMI (50.5%) whereas women presented with
Non ST Elevation Acute Coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) (70.8%). NSTE-ACS
encompasses both Unstable Angina (UA) and Non ST-Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (NSTEMI).
 There was a high prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes – the
prevalence of these risk factors has not changed over the last 10 years.
• The in-hospital mortality following STEMI was 10.6% and that following NSTEACS was 8.0%.
• The STEMI patients were generally more ill.
h 67.4% were in the intermediate-high TIMI risk score.
h 19.0% were in Killip class III/IV.
• Fibrinolytic therapy was the most common mode of reperfusion (69.1%), and only
13.7% were treated with primary PCI. Even in PCI capable centres, only 16.4%
of STEMI patients underwent Primary PCI. About 14% of patients did not receive
any form of reperfusion treatment due to late presentation, missed and delayed
diagnosis.
 The median door-to-needle time (DNT) was 45 minutes and only 35.2%
achieved the recommended DNT time of < 30 minutes. However, as a Key
Performance Indicator for the Emergency Department (ED) the DNT of < 30
mins was achieved in 87.1% of patients diagnosed with STEMI at presentation.6

 The median door-to-device (balloon) (DBT) time was 69 minutes and 63.6%
achieved the recommended DBT time of < 90 minutes.
• More than 90.0% of the patients were discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy
(DAPT) and statins. About 69.0% and 56.1% were on ß-blockers and Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE- I)/ Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) upon
discharge.
• The in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year mortality following STEMI remains high
at 10.6%, 12.3% and 17.9% respectively. This in-hospital mortality is almost
double that reported in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention
Outcomes Network) Registry-GWTG (Get With the Guidelines) database in the
United States for the period January 2012 to December 2013 which was only
4.6%.7
• Patients receiving reperfusion therapy (PCI or fibrinolytic) had overall better
survival than those who did not receive any form of reperfusion.
• Patients who underwent PCI during the index hospitalisation did better irrespective
of it being primary PCI, rescue PCI, as part of pharmaco-invasive therapy or
delayed PCI. Mortality was (PCI during the index hospitalisation compared to
no PCI):
 In-hospital: 7.9% vs 12.8%,
 30-day: 9.0% vs 14.9%
 1 year: 13.1% vs 21.8%.
• These figures are consistent with that of other registries.8,9
To improve outcomes, it is important to:
• make an early diagnosis.
• reduce delays in the pre-hospital phase and delays related to systems.
• have a system in place for timely reperfusion (fibrinolysis or PCI).
• provide a seamless clinical pathway for high risk patients to have early
revascularization.
The last Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on Management of Acute ST Segment
Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) - 3rd Edition was published in 2014. The
objectives of this update are to:
• Determine the best practice in terms of pre-hospital and in-hospital care logistics
and risk assessment.
• Decide the best reperfusion strategy for the patient.
• Optimise secondary prevention strategies.

Key message #1:
• The STEMI mortality (in-hospital, 30 day and 1 year) remains high.
• Data from the latest 2014-2015 NCVD-ACS Registry indicated that patients
receiving reperfusion (Primary PCI or fibrinolytic) had better survival
compared to patients who did not receive any form of reperfusion.
• Patients who had any form of PCI during the index hospitalisation had better
short-term and long-term survival compared to those who did not undergo
PCI. This is consistent with other registries.
The focus is to:
• Develop seamless systems and pathways in the management of STEMI patients.
• Improve the quality of care and outcomes.
• Shorten the total ischemic time by:
 patient education so that they seek medical attention early.
 improvements in the pre-hospital care, ambulance services and emergency
department management.
 establishment of STEMI networks of STEMI-referral (non-PCI capable) hospitals
and STEMI-receiving (PCI capable) hospitals. This network in the Klang Valley is
called MySTEMI.
• Work with payers and policy makers for reimbursement.
Guidelines are intended to help in the management of patients. All the
recommendations stated in this guideline may not be available to all eligible patients.
Patient care should be individualised, and sound clinical judgement still plays an
important role in decision-making.

2. DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a clinical spectrum of Coronary Artery Disease
(CAD) ranging from Unstable Angina (UA), non-ST segment Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (NSTEMI) to STEMI depending upon the degree and acuteness of
coronary occlusion (Figure 1, pg 43). In UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac
biomarkers are normal. In myocardial injury, cardiac biomarkers are raised.
It is important to distinguish between myocardial injury and myocardial infarction
(MI). Myocardial injury may be due to:10
• ischaemia and/or
• non-ischaemic causes (eg myocarditis, renal failure)
MI is myocardial injury due to ischaemia.10 It is defined pathologically as myocardial
cell death due to prolonged ischaemia.10
The preferred cardiac biomarkers are the troponins (both I and T). Elevation of
cardiac troponins indicates myocardial necrosis. A level above the 99th percentile
of the URL is abnormal and indicative of myocardial injury.10 All locally available
commercial assays indicate this level, the exact value varying depending on the
reagents used. The point of care kits, however, although giving a more rapid result,
are not sensitive enough to detect this low level.
Troponins should always be interpreted in the clinical setting. Many troponin
elevations, especially below certain cut-off points and troponin elevations without a
rise and fall, are myocardial injuries and not MI.
A rise and/or fall in the troponin level is indicative of acute injury, while a persistently
elevated level is indicative of chronic injury.10
MI is diagnosed when there is a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponins, with at least
one value above the 99th percentile of the URL, and accompanied with at least one
of the following:
i. Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin of > 30 minutes.
ii. ECG changes of ischaemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q
waves.
iii. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality.
iv. Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
MI may be STEMI or NSTE-ACS based on the ECG. (Figure 1, pg 43)
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
42
STEMI is diagnosed when there is:
• ST elevation of > 1 mm in 2 contiguous leads or
• a new onset LBBB in the resting ECG
• in a patient with ischaemic type chest pains of > 30 minutes and
• accompanied by a rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers.
New onset Right Bundle Branch Block with ST elevation of ≥ 1 mm in 2 contiguous
leads does not interfere with the diagnosis of STEMI.
In NSTE-ACS, ST elevation is absent on the resting ECG. In addition, patients having
prolonged ischaemic type chest pain and having a non-interpretable resting ECG (eg
paced rhythm, new RBBB etc) without ST elevation are having NSTE-ACS. There are
separate guidelines for NSTE-ACS.
According to the 4th Universal definition, MI can be classified as 5 types depending
on the pathology, clinical features, prognosis and treatment strategies.10 (Table 5, pg
44). This CPG focuses on STEMI which is almost always Type 1 MI (spontaneous
MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, with ulceration, fissuring, erosion or
dissection). Occasionally the other types of MI may also present as STEMI.
‘Reinfarction’ is used for MI that occurs within 28 days of the incident event (incident
MI) while recurrent MI occurs after 28 days.11

Table 5: Clinical Classification of MI
Type 1: Spontaneous MI due to coronary athero-thrombosis
Spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, erosion, or
dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more of the coronary arteries leading
to decreased myocardial blood flow or distal platelet emboli with ensuing myocyte necrosis.
Type 2: MI secondary to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply
unrelated to acute coronary athero-thrombosis
MI that occurs due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand. It may
occur in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis without plaque rupture or in the absence
of atherosclerosis eg coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery spasm, coronary
embolism, coronary artery dissection, tachy/bradyarrhythmias, anaemia, respiratory failure,
sepsis, hypotension, and hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
Type 3: MI resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable
Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and presumed new
ischaemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurring before blood samples could be
obtained, before cardiac biomarker could rise, or in rare cases cardiac biomarkers were not
collected.
Type 4a: MI related to PCI
MI associated with PCI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac troponin (cTn) values 5 x >
99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values (≤ 99th percentile URL) or a rise of
cTn values > 20% if the baseline values are elevated but are stable or falling. In addition, either
(i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia, or
(ii) new ischaemic ECG changes or new LBBB, or
(iii) angiographic loss of patency of a major coronary artery or a side branch or persistent
slow-or no-flow or embolization, or
(iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality is required.
Type 4b: MI related to stent thrombosis
MI associated with stent thrombosis is detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the
setting of myocardial ischaemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values with at
least one value above the 99th percentile URL.
Type 5: MI related to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG)
MI associated with CABG is arbitrarily deﬁned by elevation of cardiac biomarker values 10
x 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values (99th percentile URL). In
addition, either
(i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or
(ii) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or
(iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality.

Key message #2:
• MI is defined pathologically as myocardial cell death due to prolonged
ischaemia.
• It is diagnosed by the rise and/or fall in cardiac troponins, with at least one
value above the 99th percentile of the URL, and accompanied with at least
one of the following:
i. Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin of > 30
minutes.
ii. ECG changes of ischaemia/ infarction and/or the development of

 ST elevation of ≥ 1 mm in 2 contiguous leads or
 a new onset LBBB in the resting ECG
 in a patient with ischaemic type chest pains and
 accompanied by a rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers.
3. DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of STEMI is based on:
• the presence of evolutionary changes of ST elevation in the resting ECG
• history of ischaemic-type chest pain or its equivalent and
• supported by a rise and/or fall in the cardiac biomarkers
3.1
History
A thorough, targeted history is important in making the diagnosis of STEMI. Chest
pain in STEMI begins abruptly and lasts for more than thirty minutes.12 It is usually
located in the centre of the chest and may radiate to the jaw or down the left arm. It
may occur at rest or with activity. The pain may just be a tightness or heaviness in the
chest, but it is usually described as a pressure, squeezing or a severe crushing pain
with a sense of impending doom, and is associated with sweating, nausea, vomiting
and shortness of breath. The pain may be of a burning quality and localised to the
epigastria or interscapular region resulting in a misdiagnosis.
In the elderly, females and patients with diabetes, the index of suspicion should
be high because they may present with atypical symptoms such as unexplained
fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, light-headedness, unexplained sweating and
syncope. They may not necessarily have chest pain.

Key Recommendation 1:
• A quick targeted history should be taken and is essential in raising the
suspicion that the chest pain or chest pain equivalent is ischaemic in origin.
• Upon clinical suspicion of ACS, a 12-lead ECG should be performed and
interpreted immediately within 10 minutes of FMC.
3.2
Electrocardiographic changes (Table 6 & 7,pg 48 & 49)
The diagnosis of STEMI depends upon the presence of characteristic ECG changes.
The presence of ST elevation in two contiguous leads in a patient with
symptoms of ischaemia is the cardinal feature of STEMI.
The cut-off points for new or presumed new ST segment elevation at the J point (in
the absence of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) and LBBB) is:10
• the presence of ≥ 0.1 mV ST segment elevation in all leads except leads V2-V3
• a cut-off point of ≥ 0.25 mV (in males < 40 years), ≥ 0.2 mV (in males ≥ 40 years)
and ≥ 0.15 mV in females is used in leads V2-V3
In patients with BBB (new or presumed new), comparison with a previous ECG may
be helpful in determining if the changes are pre-existent. The presence of a new
onset or presumed new LBBB in a patient with typical chest pain of ischaemic origin
may indicate an infarct and should be treated as STEMI.13
Patients with ischaemic type chest pain > 30 minutes and new presumed new RBBB
accompanied with:10
• ST segment elevation ≥ 1 mm - should be managed as STEMI
• ST-segment depression or T wave abnormalities (excluding those in leads V1–V4)
– should be managed as NSTEMI. If pain persists, they should be considered for
an early PCI strategy.
Acute anterior STEMI with a Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is usually an
extensive MI due to involvement of the proximal left anterior descending artery or the
left main coronary artery. It carries a poor prognosis and these patients should also
undergo early reperfusion strategies.17 Occasionally, patients with inferior STEMI can
Other important points to note in the history are the presence of:
• Previous history of ischaemic heart disease, PCI or CABG.
• Risk factors for atherosclerosis.
• Symptoms suggestive of previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or other forms
of vascular disease.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST

47
also develop a RBBB due to involvement of the atrioventricular (A-V) branch of the
right coronary artery. In these patients, often the myocardium involved is small and
the prognosis is not that bad.14
Generally, patients with new onset Bundle Branch Block (BBB) have more
comorbidities and a worse prognosis.15,16
In the early stages of MI, the initial ECG may be normal, equivocal or show hyperacute
T-wave changes only. In these patients, if the index of suspicion of STEMI is high,
the ECG should be repeated at close intervals of at least 15 minutes to look for
progressive ST changes. Comparison with previous ECGs may also be helpful. In
addition, there are some conditions with ECG changes that can mimic that of STEMI.
(Appendix I, pg 118)
Patients with inferior STEMI should have an ECG recording of the right precordial
lead (V4R) to identify concomitant right ventricular (RV) involvement.17,18 The cut-off
point is ≥ 0.5 mm (≥ 1 mm in men < 30 years old).10
In those with ST segment depression in leads V1-V3, it is advisable to have an ECG
recording of the posterior chest wall (V7-V9) to identify a true infero-basal (formerly
known as infero-posterior) STEMI.19 The cut-off point for ST segment elevation in the
posterior leads is ≥ 0.05 mV (≥ 0.1 mV in men < 40 years).10
ST elevation of > 1mm in lead aVR may accompany anterior or inferior STEMI. This
is also a predictor of left main/3 vessel CAD and carries an adverse prognosis.20-22
Occasionally patients with ongoing chest pains and myocardial ischaemia may have
a normal or un-interpretable ECG. If the clinical suspicion of ongoing MI is high,
imaging techniques such as bedside echocardiogram may be helpful.
Key Recommendation 2:
• In all patients presenting with chest pain or chest pain equivalent, a 12 lead
ECG should be done and interpreted < 10 min of the First Medical Contact
(FMC).
• If the initial ECG is non diagnostic and the index of suspicion of STEMI is
high:
 the ECG should be repeated at close intervals of at least 15 minutes to
look for progressive ST changes.
 compared with previous ECG’s.
 additional chest leads (V 7-9) and right ventricular leads should be done to
identify posterior and right ventricular infarcts.

Serum cardiac biomarkers
The history and ECG are of paramount importance in making the diagnosis of STEMI
and determining the reperfusion strategy. A rise and fall in the levels of serum cardiac
biomarkers support the diagnosis of STEMI. One should not, however, wait for the
results of these biomarkers before initiating reperfusion therapy.
These cardiac biomarkers include:
• Cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) and Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI).
• Creatine Kinase-Myocardial Band (CK-MB).
• Creatine Kinase (CK).
• Myoglobulin -This appears rapidly after myocardial necrosis but has not achieved
widespread use in cardiac practice.25
For the relative timing, rate of rise, peak value, duration of elevation and properties of
these cardiac biomarkers following STEMI, see Figure 2, pg 51 and Table 8, pg 51.
Troponins have near absolute specificity and high clinical sensitivity for myocardial
necrosis. It rises within 3-4 hours of the onset of MI and is more likely to be positive
6 hours after symptom onset. Troponins may also be raised in other conditions (see
Appendix II, pg 119).
High Sensitive (hs) troponins can detect even lower concentrations of troponins in
the setting of myocardial necrosis leading to an earlier diagnosis of MI.10 They are
useful as a rule-out for MI. The negative predictive value is > 95% as a single test on
admission and almost 100% when repeated after 3 hours.26 Sex-dependent values
are recommended for hs-troponin assays.27-29
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
50
CK-MB (measured by mass assay) is the next best alternative. It is less tissuespecific than troponins and values differ between the gender. The criterion most
commonly used for the diagnosis of acute MI is 2 serial elevations above the 99th
percentile of a reference control group or a single result more than twice the URL.29,30
CK-MB first appears 4-6 hours after symptom onset, peaks at 24 hours, and returns
to normal in 48-72 hours. Its value in the early and late (>72 h) diagnosis of acute MI
is limited. Values for CK-MB should rise and fall; values that remain elevated without
change are almost never due to MI.
These cardiac biomarkers (troponins and CK-MB) should be measured at the time of
first assessment and repeated 6-9 hours later:
• To document the rise and/or fall exceeding the 99th percentile URL for the
diagnosis of MI.
• If the first measurement is non-diagnostic and the clinical suspicion of MI is high.
It used to be thought that troponins are not useful for the detection of reinfarction
because they can remain elevated for up to 10-14 days and sometimes longer.26
However, if a patient is suspected of having a reinfarction on clinical grounds, a ≥
20% increase in the value of either troponins or CK-MB between 2 samples 3-6
hours apart supports the diagnosis.29-31
To ensure the reliability of these tests, each individual laboratory should maintain
high quality laboratory practice and confirm the range of reference values in their
specific setting.
Total CK measurement is also not recommended owing to its poor specificity and
large distribution in skeletal muscles.29

Key Recommendation 3:
• The diagnosis of STEMI is made based on history of characteristic ischaemic
type chest pain accompanied by ECG changes of ST elevation of at least
1 mm in at least 2 contiguous leads or new onset LBBB.
• A rise and fall of the cardiac biomarkers support the diagnosis of STEMI.
• Troponins and CKMB are the cardiac biomarkers of choice.
3.4
Other diagnostic modalities
Echocardiography is a particularly useful bedside imaging technique. It is useful in
detecting:
• New regional wall motion abnormalities.
• LV and RV function.
• Mechanical complications of acute MI e.g. free wall rupture, acute ventricular
septal defect (VSD), and mitral regurgitation.
Other imaging techniques such as chest radiography, computed tomographic
coronary angiography (CTCA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide
techniques may be useful investigations in the patient presenting with acute chest
pain in difficult diagnostic situations.
They help to detect:
• Coronary atherosclerotic plaques, myocardial ischaemia and/or scars from
previous MI.
• Non-ischaemic conditions causing chest pain such as valvular heart disease, perimyocarditis, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and pneumothorax.
In STEMI, there is no role for routine CTCA. Use of CT should be confined to selected
cases where acute aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism is suspected.

4. PRE-HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT
Public awareness about heart disease should be increased so that individuals will
seek appropriate treatment early, thus reducing time from symptom onset to FMC.
Most deaths following STEMI occur in the pre-hospital phase.
Patients with ischaemic-type chest pain should go to the nearest hospital rather
than a clinic.
In STEMI, it is important to reduce total ischaemic time i.e. the time from symptom
onset to the time of institution of reperfusion strategies. Total ischaemic time is a
combination of:
1. Time from arterial occlusion to symptom onset.
2. Time from symptom onset to FMC.
3. FMC to initiation of reperfusion strategies (Primary PCI or fibrinolysis).
The public should be educated about:
• Symptoms of ACS.
• The importance of seeking early treatment at the nearest hospital.
• The benefits of early treatment – opening the blocked coronary artery as soon as
possible to limit myocardial damage to the minimum and preserve heart function.
“TIME IS MYOCARDIUM.”
Immediate measures to be taken in suspected cases of ACS.
4.1.
For the general public
• Seek immediate medical attention at the nearest hospital.
• Call for an ambulance (dial 999) or get someone to take you immediately and
directly to the nearest hospital.
• Do not drive yourself.
• If not on regular aspirin and with no history of allergy, chew 300mg aspirin
immediately. Soluble and chewable aspirin formulations are preferable to solid
aspirin either chewed or swallowed.32,33 Regular aspirin is preferred over enteric
coated aspirin in this situation because of its faster onset of action.34
• The 999 despatchers will provide additional care instructions before the arrival of
the pre-hospital care (PHC) providers.
4.2
For patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD)
• If the chest pain is suggestive of ACS (section 3.1, pg 45), take one dose of
sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) by tablet or spray, and be rapidly transported
to the nearest hospital.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
54
• Patients should be educated that taking GTN with certain drugs can cause
complications such as vasodilatation and hypotension; this includes taking
it within 48 hours of drugs such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors [sildenafil
(Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra)].
4.3
For patients with known CHD and history of previous PCI and/or CABG
• If the chest pain is suggestive of ACS (section 3.1, pg 45), take one dose of
sublingual GTN by tablet or spray, and be rapidly transported to the nearest
hospital.
• Go as soon as possible preferably to a PCI capable hospital.
4.4
Pre-hospital Care (PHC)
When a patient presents with chest pain, it is of paramount importance to determine
if:
• The pain is cardiac in origin.
• If cardiac in origin, is it due to:
 STEMI – requires immediate treatment preferably by Primary PCI if this can be
done in a timely manner.
 UA/NSTEMI.
In STEMI there is:
• Prolonged duration of ischaemic-type chest pain of > 30 minutes and
• ECG changes showing ST elevation of > 1 mm in 2 contiguous leads or a new (or
presumed new) onset LBBB.
In STEMI, TIME IS MYOCARDIUM and the patient should be transported rapidly
to a centre capable of providing reperfusion therapy to reopen the occluded infarct
related artery.
In UA/NSTEMI, the initial management is medical in accordance with the CPG on
UA/NSTEMI.
The pre-hospital management of STEMI patients should ideally be based on regional
networks designed to deliver reperfusion therapy rapidly and effectively, with efforts
made to make primary PCI available to as many patients as possible.
When there is a 999 call, the caller is first directed to Telekoms who will verify the
authenticity of the caller. It is then directed to a Medical Emergency Coordination
Centre (MECC), who will then:
A. Identify the chief complaint- If the complaint is chest pain or a chest pain
equivalent (eg chest heaviness, discomfort which may be associated with
sweating and/or shortness of breath), use a validated protocol addressing:
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
55
 nature of complaint and severity including level of alertness.
 difficulty breathing.
 changing of skin colour (pallor / blue).
 previous history of heart attack or angina.
 use of medications in the past 12 hours.
• Provide pre-arrival instructions including immediate self-care or bystander care
while waiting for the ambulance arrival.
Ambulance teams dispatched to the scene should be trained and equipped to
identify STEMI (with the use of Advanced Cardiac Care Device which is capable
of ECG recording, transmission, and real-time ECG monitoring and telemetry). This
results in direct referral to PCI centres and earlier initiation of reperfusion strategies.
This strategy is cost-effective and short-term mortality is also reduced.35-37
B. If the ECG shows changes of STEMI:
• PHC providers should administer initial therapy:
 Soluble or chewable aspirin (300mg)38,39 and
 Clopidogrel- Loading dose of 300mg, if > 75 years of age- the loading dose is
75mg.40-42
 *Fibrinolysis when applicable.44-47 - Fibrinolysis treatment initiated by PHC
providers resulted in shorter DNT, translating into greater health and cost
benefits.48
• STEMI patients:
 should be given appropriate care and monitored during transport.
 should be transferred to a PCI-capable centre, bypassing non-PCI centres if
this can be done in a timely manner.49-51
 that present to a non-PCI-capable hospital and awaiting transportation for
primary or rescue PCI should be attended in an appropriately monitored area
and accessible to the PHC personnel.
 To reduce reperfusion times, other key care processes include:52
h Pre-hospital activation of the catheterisation team.
h Single call transfer protocol from an outside facility.
h Direct access to catheterisation lab with Emergency Department (ED) bypass
for both patients diagnosed with STEMI and transported directly to the ED via
ambulances and those transferred from non-PCI centers.53-57
• PHC services, emergency departments, and critical care units should have
a written updated STEMI management protocol, preferably shared within
geographical networks with the same cardiology services.

• All hospitals and PHC services participating in the care of patients with STEMI
should record and audit delay times and work to achieve and maintain quality
targets.58
• It is recommended that primary PCI-capable centres deliver a 24/7 service and be
able to perform primary PCI without delay.58
*If the anticipated time from FMC to PCI-mediated reperfusion (wire-crossing the
lesion) is >120 minutes, then pre-hospital or nearest in-hospital fibrinolysis is an
option.46,59
C. If the ECG does not show STEMI:
• the patient should be transported to the nearest hospital preferably with cardiology
services.
4.5
Pre-hospital Care Personnel
Pre-hospital care personnel should be trained to:
• identify patients at high risk of developing ACS such as those with prior heart
disease, the elderly, presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors - diabetes,
smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and a family history of premature heart
disease.
• interpret the ECG, identify and treat common arrhythmias.
• identify patients with STEMI based on history and characteristic ECG changes
after consultation with the ED physician/medical officer.
• assess, stabilise and monitor the patient’s haemodynamics continuously prior to
and during transfer.
• administer fibrinolysis out of hospital after excluding the contraindications in
patients who cannot be transferred to a PCI-capable centre in a timely manner.46,59
Key Recommendation 3:
• Patients with suspected STEMI should be given soluble or chewable 300 mg
aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel.
• These patients should be rapidly transported to the hospital for early
institution of reperfusion strategies.
• If the anticipated time from FMC to PCI mediated reperfusion (wire crossing
the lesion) is > 120 minutes, then pre-hospital or nearest in-hospital
fibrinolysis is an option.
Key Messages #4:
• The public and PHC personnel should be educated on the importance of
early diagnosis and the benefits of early treatment.

5. STEMI NETWORK
The objective of a STEMI network is to link non-PCI-capable centres to PCI-capable
centres with the aim of providing PCI services in a timely manner for patients:
• With STEMI
• Who have been given fibrinolytic therapy and:
 have failed reperfusion or,
 as part of a pharmaco-invasive strategy or,
 have high risk features requiring early intervention.
The optimal treatment of these patients should be based on the implementation of
networks between hospitals (‘hub’ and ‘spoke’) with various levels of technology,
linked by an efficient ambulance service.
The main features of such a network are:60
• Clear definition of geographic areas of responsibility.
• Shared written protocols based on risk stratification and transportation by a trained
physician, nurse, or PHC personnel in appropriately equipped ambulances.
• Pre-hospital triage and management of STEMI patients (see section 4, pg 53-56)
Ideally, primary PCI centres (hub) should perform the procedure systematically on
a 24/7 basis for all STEMI patients. In centres with limited resources, a primary PCI
programme should still be encouraged and eventually aim to offer a 24/7 service.
At present, a STEMI network is available in the Kelang valley (MYSTEMI) and in
Pahang. It is hoped that similar networks will be set up throughout the country.
Essentials of STEMI systems of care include:54,55,58,60
• A single telephone emergency number (999).
• Ambulances equipped with 12-lead ECGs and defibrillators, and staffed with welltrained PHC personnel, capable of basic and advanced life support.
• Automatic ECG interpretation or ECG telemetry.
• Direct telephone access between the medical officer and the cardiology team on
call.
• Protocols for standardized care (diagnosis, therapy, and transfer).
• Cardiologist as a network leader with close collaboration with the emergency
physician, internal medicine and family medicine specialists.
• Involvement of healthcare authorities in both private and public sectors.
• Addressing insurance and other reimbursement issues.
• Public information campaigns stressing the importance of early treatment.
• Regular meetings of the involved parties.
• A prospective registry to assess progress and need for change.
• Quality Improvement Measures and Quality Improvement Programs.

Total Ischaemic Time
Recommendations to reduce total ischaemic time in a STEMI network:
For Primary PCI:
• Target from FMC to “wire crossing” (Door to Balloon (Device) Time):
 FMC in PCI capable hospital (“Hub”): ≤ 90 minutes
 FMC in Non-PCI capable hospital (“Spoke”) : ≤ 120 minutes
• Symptom onset to Door 1 (Emergency Department (ED) of spoke):
 Community health education
• Door 1 (ED of spoke) to First Medical Contact (FMC) - ≤ 10 minutes
 Patient should be triaged to the Fast Lane.
 Door 1 to ECG interpretation and decision (within 10 minutes).
• Door 1 (ED of spoke) to departure - ≤ 30 minutes
 Time to ECG; goal < 10 minutes.
 Time to ambulance commitment; goal < 10 minutes.
 Time to ambulance arrival and departure; goal < 10 minutes.
 Total time in ED (Door In, Door Out- DIDO); goal ≤ 30 minutes.
• Door 1 (ED of spoke) to Door 2 (ED of hub) - Travel time ≤ 60 minutes
• Door 2 (ED of hub) to wire crossing- ≤ 30 minutes
For Fibrinolysis:
• If transfer time to the PCI capable hospital is prolonged fibrinolysis is advised.49,59
Transfer times:
h ≤ 90 minutes - If transferred from a non-PCI centre (spoke) to a PCI centre
(hub): DIDO in the spoke hospital of < 30 minutes + travel time of < 60
minutes.
h ≤ 60 minutes - If ambulance transport direct to PCI centre.
 The goal is 10 minutes from diagnosis to initiation of fibrinolysis. (Door to needle
time <30 minutes)
 If reperfusion is not successful, the patient should be transferred to a PCI
capable hospital for rescue PCI.
 If reperfusion is successful, the patient:
h Can be transferred to a PCI capable hospital if:
◊ It is part of a pharmaco-invasive strategy.
◊ Has high risk features requiring early intervention.
h Managed at the spoke hospital if the patient has low risk features.

6. IN-HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT
Early management of STEMI is directed at:
• Pain relief.
• Establishing early reperfusion
• Treatment of complications.
6.1
Initial recognition and management
When the patient with suspected STEMI reaches the emergency department,
evaluation and initial management should be prompt (FAST TRACK - RED ZONE)
because the benefits of reperfusion therapy are greater the earlier it is instituted.61-65
• A quick targeted history should be taken, and vital signs noted. The diagnosis
should be confirmed with an ECG, which should be done as soon as possible,
within 10 minutes of the patient’s arrival in the emergency department.66,67
• In patients suspected of having a STEMI in view of the prolonged ischaemic-type
chest pain of > 30 minutes but without obvious ST elevation seen in the resting
ECG, the following steps may be taken: (Section 3.1 and 3.2, pg 45-49 and Table
6, pg 48)
 repeating the ECG at 15-minute intervals to detect evolving changes of STEMI.
 the use of additional chest leads may be helpful in detecting STEMI at
uncommon and difficult to detect sites:
h Additional posterior chest wall leads (V7–V9) can detect a posterior MI
(circumflex occlusion).68-72
h Right precordial leads (V3R and V4R) may be necessary to identify
concomitant Right Ventricular (RV) infarction in the presence of an inferior
wall MI.69,71,73
• A missed STEMI carries a poorer prognosis because of the missed opportunity for
reperfusion and myocardial salvage.72
THUS, EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND PROMPT TREATMENT OF STEMI IS VITAL.
• Continuous ECG monitoring using a monitor with defibrillation capacity should be
commenced as soon as the diagnosis of STEMI is made.74
• Pain should be relieved with titrated IV morphine at 2-5 mg by slow bolus injection
every 5-15 minutes as necessary. Watch for adverse events – hypotension and
respiratory depression. Antiemetic (IV metoclopramide 10 mg or promethazine 25
mg) should be given with morphine and 8-hourly as necessary.
• Venous access established and blood taken for cardiac biomarkers (CKMB), full
blood count, renal profile, glucose and lipid profile. A baseline lipid profile can
help guide the dose of high dose statin to be administered. Preferably two IV lines
should be set up.
• Intramuscular injections and NSAIDs should be avoided.

• The patient’s suitability for reperfusion by either fibrinolytic therapy or primary PCI
should be quickly assessed.
• The following should be done immediately and concomitantly in the emergency
department (See Flow Chart 1, pg 33):
 Assessment and stabilisation of the patient’s haemodynamics.
 One dose of sublingual GTN by tablet or spray if chest pain persists (avoid if
SBP < 90 mmHg).
 300 mg of soluble or chewable aspirin if not given earlier.38,39
 Clopidogrel at a dose of 300 mg should be given, if not given earlier.41,42
 Alternatively, the following may be given as loading doses if primary PCI is
being considered:
h 300-600 mg of clopidogrel40,75
h 180 mg of ticagrelor76,77
 Oxygen is administered in patients with hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 95% or PaO2 < 60
mmHg). Routine oxygen is not recommended in patients with SpO2 ≥ 95%.78-80
Key Message #6:
• Early management of STEMI is directed at:
 Pain relief.
 Establishing early reperfusion.
 Treatment of complications.
Key Recommendation 4:
• “Time is muscle” - Every patient with STEMI should have the occluded
artery reopened (reperfusion therapy) as soon as possible after the onset of
symptoms.
• Reperfusion therapy is indicated in all patients with symptoms of ischaemia
of <12 hours duration and persistent ST-segment elevation.

7. REPERFUSION STRATEGIES
A patient’s immediate and long-term prognosis following STEMI can be predicted
by using the:
• Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) STEMI risk score81 (Appendix III, pg
120) - This was specifically developed for patients with STEMI or
• GRACE risk score (Appendix IV, pg 121-122).82,83 -this predicts in-hospital and
6-month mortality in patients with ACS.
Risk assessment is a continuous process that should be repeated throughout
hospitalisation and at the time of discharge.
The appropriate and timely use of some form of reperfusion therapy is more
important than the choice of therapy.
Early and prompt reperfusion is crucial as TIME LOST is equivalent to MYOCARDIUM
LOST.62,84,85
Primary PCI is superior to fibrinolytic therapy as a reperfusion strategy.49-51
However, in patients who present within 3 hours of symptom onset and are at lowrisk, both treatment strategies appear to have similar benefits.86,87
Generally, in most of our hospitals, fibrinolytic therapy is more readily available and
constitutes the main reperfusion strategy.
If both choices are available, the reperfusion strategy of choice is still primary PCI if
it can be done in a timely manner by experienced operators in PCI capable centres.
The following factors are important considerations:
• Time from symptom onset to FMC.
• Time to PCI (time from hospital arrival to wire crossing i.e. Door to Balloon (Device)
time- DBT/DDT).
• Time to hospital fibrinolysis (time from hospital arrival to administration of
fibrinolytic therapy i.e. DNT).
• Contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy.
• High-risk patients.

MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST

63
The best reperfusion strategy will depend upon:
A. Time from onset of symptoms to STEMI Diagnosis
• Early presentation (within 3 hours of symptom onset)
If both treatment options are readily available, they have been shown to be equally
effective except for the following situations where primary PCI is the preferred
strategy:86,87
 Fibrinolytic therapy is contraindicated.
 In high-risk patients.
 PCI time delay (DBT minus (–) DNT) is more than 60 minutes.88
• Late presentation (3 to 12 hours of symptom onset)
 Primary PCI is preferred.10-12 The STEMI diagnosis to wire crossing should be
within 90 minutes if the patient presents at a PCI-capable facility.
 If transferred from a centre with no PCI facilities, the STEMI diagnosis to wire
crossing should be less than ≤ 120 minutes (including transfer delay).89 This is
made up of:
h DIDO of non PCI-capable hospital (spoke): ≤ 30 minutes.
h Transport time to PCI-capable centre (hub): ≤ 60 minutes.
h Door of PCI-capable centre to wire crossing: ≤ 30 minutes.
 If the time delay to primary PCI is longer than > 120minutes, the best option is
to give fibrinolytic therapy and make arrangements to transfer the patient to a
PCI-capable centre for a pharmaco-invasive strategy.65,90-92
• Very late presentation (> 12 hours)
 Both primary PCI and fibrinolytic therapy are not routinely recommended in
patients who are asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable.93,94
 However, reperfusion therapy would still be beneficial in patients with persistent
ischaemic symptoms, hemodynamic or electrical instability. In this subgroup,
primary PCI is the preferred strategy.
B. Contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy
Absolute contraindications
• Risk of intracranial haemorrhage
 History of intracranial bleed.
 History of ischaemic stroke within 3 months.
 Known structural cerebral vascular lesion (e.g. arteriovenous malformation).
 Known intracranial neoplasm.
• Risk of bleeding
 Active bleeding or bleeding diathesis (excluding menses).
 Significant head trauma within 3 months.
 Suspected aortic dissection.

Relative contraindications
• Risk of intracranial haemorrhage
 Severe uncontrolled hypertension on presentation (blood pressure (BP) >
180/110 mmHg)*.
 Ischaemic stroke more than 3 months.
 History of chronic, severe uncontrolled hypertension.
• Risk of bleeding
 Current use of anticoagulant in therapeutic doses [International Normalised
Ratio (INR) > 2] or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).
 Recent major surgery < 3 weeks.
 Traumatic or prolonged CPR > 10 minutes.
 Recent internal bleeding (e.g. gastrointestinal or urinary tract haemorrhage)
within 4 weeks.
 Non-compressible vascular puncture.
 Active peptic ulcer.
• Others
 Pregnancy.
 Prior exposure (> 5 days and within 12 months of first usage) to streptokinase
(if planning to use same agent).95
* The BP should be reduced prior to institution of fibrinolytic therapy
C. High-risk patients
High-risk patients include those with:
• Large infarcts.
• Anterior infarcts.
• Hypotension and cardiogenic shock.
• Significant arrhythmias.
• Elderly patients.
• Post-revascularization (post-CABG and post-PCI).
• Post-infarct angina.
Primary PCI is the preferred strategy in patients in Category B who have
contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy and those in Category C, the high risk
patients.96-98
Primary PCI is more cost-effective than thrombolysis-based care and should
become the treatment of choice for all STEMI patients provided it could be delivered
'in a timely fashion'.
Patients presenting with ischaemic type chest pains > 30 minutes and continuing
to have chest pains but with a non-interpretable ST-segment on the ECG, such as
I,A
IIa,A
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
65
those with bundle branch block or ventricular pacing, may be considered for a PCI
strategy if resources are available.99,100
These patients should not be given fibrinolysis.
7.1.
Fibrinolytic therapy
Fibrinolytic therapy (FT) has been shown to reduce mortality when given within
the appropriate time frame.62,101 When given within 2 hours from time of onset of
symptoms (the “golden hour”), it is most beneficial and has been shown to be able
to abort the infarction and reduce mortality by up to 50%.62,87,102,103
In the golden hour, when symptom duration is within 1 to 2 hours, prompt FT may
provide clinical benefit compared with primary PCI and should be considered as a
potentially preferable option.
When ﬁbrinolysis is the reperfusion strategy, it is recommended to initiate this
treatment as soon as possible after STEMI diagnosis. If it is diagnosed in prehospital
settings by PHC in a well- equipped ambulance, fibrinolytic therapy should preferably
be initiated pre-hospital while awaiting transfer to a hospital.43,87,104,105
The DNT should be within 30 minutes.62,84 Strategies should be put in place to
achieve this target. Fibrinolytic therapy should be made available in all hospitals and
there should be protocols to initiate it in the emergency department.
Pre-hospital fibrinolytic therapy has been shown to achieve faster reperfusion.86,87
7.1.1
Indications
Fibrinolytic therapy should only be given to patients with STEMI. (Section 3.1 and
3.2 pg 45-49)
It has no role and may even be detrimental in patients with NSTEMI.106,107
7.1.2
Contraindications
See section 7 (B), pg 63-64.
7.1.3
Choice of fibrinolytic agent
Presently the agents available in Malaysia are:
Streptokinase
This is the most widely used agent. It is not fibrin specific and it results in a lower
patency rate of the occluded vessel at 60 minutes than fibrin specific agents.108-110
Despite having a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage, the reduction in mortality is
less than with fibrin specific agents.108,111

MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST

INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
66
Streptokinase is antigenic and promotes the production of antibodies. Thus the
utilization of this agent for reinfarction is less effective if given between 3 days and
1 or even 4 years after the first administration.95 Primary PCI or fibrin specific agents
should then be considered.
Regimen:
1.5 mega units in 100 ml normal saline or 5% dextrose over 1 hour.
Fibrin Specific Agents
A fibrin-speciﬁc agent such as tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) is recommended.112,113
The benefit of using TNK-tPA is that it causes more rapid reperfusion of the occluded
artery than streptokinase and is given as a single bolus dose.112,113
This is a weight-based regimen and thus there is a risk of bleeding if the weight has
been overestimated.

Following administration of a fibrin specific agent, anticoagulant is recommended
with:
• Heparin;112 or
• Enoxaparin.113,114
Either one of these agents should be given immediately after the completion of
fibrinolysis and continued for at least 48 hours.
Subcutaneous (s.c.) fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily may be given as an alternative for 8
days or until discharge.115

7.1.4
Fibrinolysis in Unstable Patients
Ideally, these patients should be transferred for primary PCI. If this cannot be done in
a timely manner or the patient is too unstable for transfer, they should be considered
for fibrinolysis and then transferred for early PCI when stable.
7.1.4.1 Presence of Hypotension at Presentation (SBP < 90mmHg)
Hypotension may be due to:
• Relative hypovolaemia.
• RV infarction.
• Acute LV failure.
These patients should be:
• Given IV fluids as necessary.
• Started on inotropes, preferably noradrenaline.116-118
Fibrinolytic therapy with a fibrin specific agent is preferred.
7.1.4.2 Hypotension during Fibrinolysis
If blood pressure drops during infusion of the fibrinolytic agent, administer
fluids or start noradrenaline. When the SBP >90mmHg, fibrinolysis can be given
concomitantly.
7.1.4.3 Presence of LV Failure
These patients should be treated with oxygen, non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation, high flow nasal cannula or intubation and ventilation as necessary.
Diuretics should be given intravenously.
Fibrinolytic therapy with a fibrin specific agent should then be administered.
7.1.4.4 Presence of Cardiac Arrest
If the ECG shows STEMI, fibrinolysis with a fibrin specific agent may be considered.
7.1.5
Indicators of successful reperfusion
There is no sensitive bedside clinical method to reliably detect successful reperfusion.
Some useful guides are:
• Resolution of chest pain (may be confounded by the use of narcotic analgesics).
• Early return of ST segment elevation to isoelectric line or a decrease in the height
of the ST elevation by 50% (in the lead that records the highest ST elevation)
within 60-90 minutes of initiation of fibrinolytic therapy.119
• Early peaking of CK and CK-MB levels.
• Restoration and/or maintenance of haemodynamic and/or electrical stability.

The occurrence of 'reperfusion arrhythmias' is not a reliable indicator of successful
reperfusion. An exception is accelerated idioventricular rhythm and sudden sinus
bradycardia which have been correlated with a patent infarct-related coronary artery
after fibrinolytic therapy or primary PCI.119
7.1.6
Failed fibrinolysis
Failure of fibrinolytic agents to open the occluded infarct related artery (IRA)
is manifested as continuing chest pain, persistent ST segment elevation and
haemodynamic instability. These patients are more likely to develop complications
such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
The treatment of choice for these patients is rescue PCI.120,121
They should not be given a second dose of a fibrinolytic agent. This is because there
has been no difference in event free survival demonstrated whether these patients
are given a repeat dose of a fibrinolytic agent or are treated conservatively.122
7.2
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)
7.2.1
Primary PCI
Primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy in patients with ischaemic
symptoms < 12 hours when it can be performed in a timely manner and promptly
by experienced operators in centres performing a sufficient number of primary PCI
procedures.49-51,89
7.2.1.1 Transfer of patient
Transfer of patients with STEMI to PCI-capable centres should be considered in the
following situations:
• Onset of ischaemic symptoms < 12 hours and fibrinolytic therapy is contraindicated
irrespective of time delay from FMC.123,124
• Cardiogenic shock irrespective of time delay.96,125
• STEMI presenting with acute HF. These patients should be stabilised rapidly and
ventilated if necessary. Options include:
 Transfer for primary PCI or
 Give fibrinolytic therapy and transfer the patient within 24 hours for a pharmacoinvasive strategy.90,91,113,114
• When symptoms have been present between 3 and 12 hours and PCI can be
performed within 120 minutes(preferably 90 minutes ).59,89,126,127
• When transferred from a non PCI- capable hospital to a PCI-capable hospital, the
DIDO time should be < 30 minutes and transfer time should be < 60 minutes.
• Failed fibrinolytic therapy or re-occlusion post-fibrinolysis (see Failed Fibrinolysis,
section 7.1.6, pg 68).89,120-122,128

• As part of a pharmaco-invasive strategy in stable patients who have been
given fibrinolytics and an elective PCI can be performed within 3 and 24
hours.90,91,113,114,129-132
7.2.2
PCI post-fibrinolysis or patients who did not receive fibrinolysis
Following fibrinolysis, or in patients who did not receive fibrinolysis, early PCI,
preferably during the index hospitalisation, should be considered in the following
situations:
• Failed reperfusion or re-occlusion after fibrinolytic therapy.120-122
• Cardiogenic shock or acute pulmonary oedema that develops after initial
presentation.96,97,125,133
• Stable patients within 3-24 hours post-fibrinolysis as part of a pharmaco-invasive
strategy.90,91,113,114,129-132
• STEMI TIMI risk score of ≥ 6.0 at admission.82 (see Appendix III, pg 120)
• Spontaneous or easily provoked myocardial ischaemia such as recurrence of
chest pains and/or dynamic ECG changes.134,135
• If symptoms are completely relieved and ST segment completely normalises
either spontaneously or after GTN or antiplatelet therapy.
Failed fibrinolytic therapy is manifested as one or more of the following:
• Ongoing chest pains.
• Persistent hyper-acute ECG changes (< 50% resolution of ST elevation in the lead
showing the greatest degree of ST elevation at presentation).119
• Haemodynamic and electrical instability.
Rescue PCI is initiated very early (1 to 2 hours) after failed fibrinolytic therapy.
It is associated with a reduction in HF, reinfarction and a trend towards reduction
in mortality but with increased risk of bleeding and stroke. Hence, these patients
should be individually evaluated.121,122
7.2.3
Facilitated PCI
This refers to a strategy of planned immediate PCI (< 1 hour) after an initial
pharmacologic regimen consisting of a reduced dose of a fibrinolytic agent,
glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor or a combination of these agents. The purpose of
facilitated PCI was to achieve earlier reperfusion but retain the benefits of primary
PCI.
This strategy was associated with increased mortality and major bleeding. It is thus
not recommended.136-138

myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion status.
Given the advances in PCI and antithrombotic therapy, recent studies show that
routine angiography with the intent to perform PCI with stenting between 3 and
24 hours after fibrinolysis improved patient outcomes as compared to symptom or
ischaemia guided delayed intervention. This strategy has resulted in a significant
reduction in mortality and reinfarction rates without an increase in adverse
events.114,126,139-141
All patients who have been given fibrinolytic therapy should be considered
for a strategy of early PCI between 3-24 hours after fibrinolysis wherever
possible.90,91, 113,114,129-132,139-141
7.2.5
Delayed Angiography and PCI -Symptom onset >12h
A primary PCI strategy is indicated in the presence of ongoing symptoms suggestive
of ischaemia, haemodynamic instability, or life-threatening arrhythmias.142
In asymptomatic patients, routine PCI of an occluded IRA > 48h after onset of STEMI
is not indicated.143,144
7.2.6
Delayed selective angiography and PCI
Patients with STEMI who have not had coronary angiography within 24 hours should
be considered for delayed selective angiography. This refers to a strategy of doing
angiography and PCI only if there is spontaneous or inducible ischaemia.
Stable patients who are not at high risk (Section 7 (C); pg 64) and who did not
undergo early (<24 hours) angiography should undergo non-invasive ischaemia
testing.
If spontaneous or inducible ischaemia is present, then angiography and appropriate
revascularization should be performed.134,135
7.3.
Technical considerations and pharmacotherapy during primary PCI
For a favourable outcome, it is important to obtain good TIMI 3 epicardial flow
as well as optimum reperfusion of the myocardial microvasculature145,146 (TIMI
myocardial perfusion grade – TMP) (Refer to the Malaysian CPG on the Management
of Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI) ,1st Ed 2009).

7.3.1
Antiplatelet therapy to support primary PCI for STEMI
• Oral aspirin 300 mg should be given before primary PCI.
• In addition, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor should also be given:
 Clopidogrel 300-600 mg loading dose to be given as early as possible40,75,147, or
 Prasugrel 60 mg loading dose to be given after the coronary angiogram has
been performed148 or
 Ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose to be given as early as possible.76,77
• GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in selected patients with IC thrombus:
 Abciximab.149-152
 Tirofiban.153-155
7.3.2
Antithrombotic therapy to support primary PCI for STEMI
• IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) with additional bolus to maintain activated clotting
time (ACT) above 275 secs.156
• IV low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) – enoxaparin.157
• IV fondaparinux is not recommended because of the risk of catheter thrombosis.115
• Bivalirudin infusion.
7.3.3
PCI access site
• Radial access is recommended over femoral access if performed by an
experienced radial operator.158-164
• Radial access has the advantage of reducing bleeding complications. However,
when larger devices are necessary and the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
is anticipated, femoral access may be preferable.
• A recent study, however, showed that bleeding rates and 30-day mortality following
PCI for STEMI were no different between radial and femoral approaches.165
7.3.4
Technical tips during procedure
• Primary PCI should be performed on the IRA.
• Complete revascularization should not be routinely attempted on critical lesions
in non-culprit vessels in the same procedure when patient is in cardiogenic
shock.166-176
• PCI is indicated in a non-infarct artery at a later time when there is evidence of
myocardial ischaemia or Fractional Flow Reserve < 0.8.134,135,166
• Stenting is recommended (over balloon angioplasty) for primary PCI.176
• Stenting with new-generation DES is recommended over BMS for primary
PCI.177-180 Despite higher total costs relative to BMS, DES appeared to be a costeffective strategy.181,182

7.3.5
Distal embolisation and the use of adjunctive devices and
pharmacotherapy
Thrombus burden is usually large if the patient presents late or the IRA is ectatic.
Predictors of slow flow and no-reflow (TIMI 0) of the IRA are:183,184
• Vessel diameter ≥ 3.5 mm.
• Treatment of the right coronary artery.
• Higher TIMI thrombus score.
• Angiographic findings such as:
 “Cut-off” sign (i.e. abrupt occlusion of the epicardial vessel) seen on the
coronary angiogram.
 Persistent contrast stasis just proximal and/or distal to the obstruction.
 Longer lesions.
 Thrombus of > 5 mm proximal to occlusion.
 Floating thrombus.
The following steps can be taken to prevent distal embolization:
• Aspiration catheter - Routine use of thrombus aspiration is not recommended.185,186
• Distal embolic protection - meta-analysis showed that these devices had a neutral
effect on mortality.187
• GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors – abciximab and tirofiban therapy during primary PCI showed
short term benefit especially in high-risk patients.149-155,188,189 The data on its effect
on long-term survival is however conflicting.
7.3.6
Management of no reflow
No reflow (TIMI 0) or slow reflow (TIMI 1 and 2) may occur transiently or may persist
after primary PCI.
No-reflow may occur as a consequence of:
• Microvascular dysfunction from vasospasm.
• Distal embolisation.
• Intimal dissection/intramural haematoma.
It is associated with poor recovery of LV function and a higher incidence of post-MI
complications.
Management includes:
• IC GTN 100 - 200 µg boluses.
• IC verapamil 100 – 200 µg boluses.
• IC adenosine 100 – 200 µg boluses.
• IC nitroprusside 50 – 100 µg boluses.
• IV nicardipine 100-200 ug boluses

Key Message #7:
Primary PCI is superior to fibrinolysis for STEMI when performed in a timely
manner at experienced centres. (see Flow Charts 1 & 2, pg 33 & 34)
• If the patient presents at a PCI centre, then the time from FMC (First
Medical Contact) to wire crossing should be ≤ 90 minutes.
• If transferred from a centre with no PCI facilities, the time from FMC to wire
crossing should be ≤120 minutes (including transfer delay). This is made up
of:
 door-in-door-out (DIDO) of non–PCI-capable hospital (spoke): ≤ 30
minutes.
 Transport time to PCI -capable centre (hub): ≤ 60 minutes.
 Door of PCI capable centre to wire crossing: ≤ 30 minutes.
 If the time delay to primary PCI is >120 minutes, the best option is to give
fibrinolytic therapy and make arrangements to transfer the patient to a PCI
capable centre for a pharmaco-invasive strategy.
Key Recommendation 6:
• When fibrinolytic therapy is administered, the Door to Needle time (DNT)
should be ≤ 30 minutes.
• Whenever possible, patients given fibrinolytic therapy should be considered
for a pharmaco-invasive approach (elective angiogram within 3-24 hours
post fibrinolysis).
Key Recommendation 5:
• Primary PCI is superior to fibrinolysis for STEMI and should be performed in
a timely manner at experienced centres. (see Flow Chart 2, pg 34)

8. Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) management
8.1
General measures
All STEMI patients should be admitted to a CCU or equivalent unit equipped with
adequate monitoring facilities.
Following successful reperfusion, uncomplicated cases may be kept for a minimum
of 24 hours before transfer to a step-down unit. They can sit out of bed and undertake
self-care the next day. Patients with STEMI complicated by significant myocardial
damage and arrhythmias need longer bed rest and may need to be kept in the CCU
longer.
Sedatives may be useful. Titrated IV opioids may be administered to relieve pain.
Use of bedside commode and assisted bedside washing should be safe in most
patients.
The Valsalva manoeuvre has been shown to precipitate dangerous haemodynamic
and electrocardiographic changes.190 Prevention of constipation with stool softeners
is encouraged.
Early referral for cardiac rehabilitation is advisable.191
8.2
Monitoring
The general condition of the patient, vital signs, pulse oximetry and the cardiac
rhythm should be continuously monitored following STEMI.
In general, systolic blood pressure should be > 90mmHg prior to starting ACE-I or
ß-blockers.
8.3
Concomitant therapy
8.3.1
Oxygen
• Oxygen, via nasal prongs, at 2-4 litres/minute is usually adequate. One should aim
to maintain the oxygen saturation > 95%.78-80
8.3.2
Antiplatelet agents
In STEMI, DAPT is indicated.40-42,75-77,192-196 This includes:
• A loading dose of aspirin 300 mg followed by low dose aspirin 75-100 mg daily
which is indicated indefinitely after STEMI unless contraindicated.40-42,192

h In patients 75 years of age or younger given fibrinolysis, a loading dose of
300 mg may be administered followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg daily.
In older patients, a loading dose of 75 mg may be adequate.42,194
h In patients considered for primary PCI, a higher loading dose of 300-600 mg
may be necessary.40,75,147
 Prasugrel – OR
h This has been investigated as part of a primary PCI strategy only.148,195,196
h The loading dose is 60 mg and it should be given after the coronary
angiogram.148,195,196 The maintenance dose is 10 mg daily.148,195,196
h It is not recommended for patients > 75 years old, < 60 kg weight, have a
history of TIA or stroke due to a higher risk of major bleeding.148,195,196
 Ticagrelor
h This has been investigated as part of a primary PCI strategy only.77,197
h The loading dose is 180 mg and given early after the diagnosis. The
maintenance dose is 90 mg bd.77,197
h Potential drawback is dyspnoea and transient ventricular pauses during
the first week. This was rarely associated with symptoms or need for a
pacemaker. Caution should be exercised in patients with heart block.
 Ticlopidine
h Ticlopidine has not been tested as part of either a fibrinolytic or primary PCI
strategy.
h It may be, however, be considered for secondary prevention.198,199
h The dose is 250 mg twice daily.
• The duration of DAPT will vary and depend on the patient’s risk of future coronary
thrombotic events and his bleeding risk.200-202 Prolonged DAPT leads to an absolute
decrease in stent thrombosis and ischaemic complications of ≈1 to 2% at the cost
of an absolute increase in bleeding complications of ≈1%.201,202
• In East Asians (Japan, South Korea and China), the newer P2Y12 inhibitors had
similar efficacy as clopidogrel but at an increased risk of bleeding.203-205
• Recommendations for duration of DAPT:
 Post-fibrinolysis –
h The duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) should be between 1 month
to 1 year, the duration being a balance between the ischaemic vs the bleeding
risks.41,42,192,193
 Post PCI –
h DAPT for up to a year depending on the thrombotic/ischaemic versus
bleeding risks.202
h In patients with high bleeding risks, a shorter period of DAPT of 6 months
may be considered.200-202
• Aspirin and ticagrelor 60 mg twice a day for >12 months may be considered for
up to 3 years, in high risk patients who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding
complication.206

Antithrombotic therapy
These agents are administered to patients who received fibrinolytic therapy and did
not undergo PCI.207-210 They include: (Table 9, pg 78)
A) Heparin
• UFH207
• LMWH - enoxaparin207,208
 In patients > 75 years of age and with renal impairment (serum creatinine (Scr) >
200 µmol/L in women and > 250 µmol/L in men), UFH is preferable to LMWH.208
B) subcutaneous Anti Xa inhibitors
• fondaparinux209,210
 May be given to those patients treated medically including those not receiving
fibrinolytic therapy.210 In STEMI patients not undergoing primary PCI and not
receiving fibrinolytic therapy, fondaparinux was shown to reduce mortality and
reinfarction without increasing bleeding and stroke rates when compared to
UFH or placebo.210
 It is associated with an increase in catheter-related thrombus and coronary
angiographic complications. Thus, fondaparinux is not recommended as the
sole anti-coagulant during PCI.115
C) Oral Anticoagulants (OAC)
These include:
• Vitamin K antagonists - Warfarin
• Non-Vitamin K antagonists - Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC)
OACs are prescribed for the following indications:
8.3.3.1. Atrial Fibrillation
8.3.3.2. LV thrombus
8.3.3.1 Atrial Fibrillation (Appendix 5, pg 123 for CHA2DS2- VASc SCORE)
In STEMI patients with AF who had undergone PCI, the use of DOAC with antiplatelet therapy is associated with a lower risk of bleeding than the standard triple
therapy (DAPT + warfarin).211-213
The following regimens may be considered:
1. Warfarin + DAPT
• Triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) may be
given , with a target INR in the lower part of the recommended target range (INR:
2) 214,215
• The duration of triple therapy depends on the individual risk for ischaemic and
bleeding events – between 1-6 months.216

• The use of ticagrelor or prasugrel is not recommended as part of triple antithrombotic therapy with aspirin and OAC.216
2. DOAC + DAPT
• Dabigatran 110 or 150mg twice daily + aspirin <100 mg daily + clopidogrel 75mg
once daily for one to six months depending on bleeding risks followed by antiplatelet monotherapy and dabigatran 110 or 150 mg twice daily211 or
• Rivaroxaban 15mg once daily (10mg if CrCl 30-50ml/min) + aspirin + clopidogrel
75mg once daily for one to six months depending on bleeding risks followed by
anti-platelet monotherapy and rivaroxaban 15mg once daily.212 or
• Rivaroxaban 2.5mg twice daily and aspirin 75-100mg once daily and clopidogrel
75mg once daily for one to 12 months.212 The duration of DAPT with this
combination will depend on the risk of stent thrombosis versus bleeding risk.
Rivaroxaban 2.5mg is yet to be registered in Malaysia.
• Apixaban 5 mg bid and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for 6 months resulted in less
bleeding and fewer hospitalisations without significant differences in the incidence
of ischaemic events when compared to regimens that included warfarin, aspirin,
or both.213
In patients with AF who have undergone PCI, the risks of ischaemic complications
(cardioembolic stroke, coronary ischaemic events) must be balanced against the
risks of bleeding. In addition, the clinical setting (elderly, women, kidney disease etc)
as well as the angiographic complexity of the PCI should also be considered in the
choice of anti-thrombotic regimen.217
In patients with a low risk of thrombotic events or a high risk of bleeding, early
omission of aspirin therapy and treatment with a DOAC plus clopidogrel is entirely
warranted. However, in patients undergoing complex, multivessel, or high-risk PCI
or in those presenting with high-risk STEMI, aspirin should probably not be routinely
omitted for at least several weeks or longer, depending on bleeding risk.217
In patients who have been stable (> 1-year post STEMI and post PCI/stent), warfarin
or DOAC monotherapy should be used and concomitant anti-platelet therapy should
not be prescribed on a routine basis.216
Combination of OAC plus single anti-platelet therapy (preferably clopidogrel 75 mg
once a day, or as an alternative, aspirin 75–100 mg once a day) may be sometimes
continued in very selected cases, e.g. stenting of the left main, proximal left anterior
descending, proximal bifurcation, recurrent MIs, etc.216

• The benefit of long-term treatment with ß-blockers after STEMI is well established
from clinical trials conducted in the pre-thrombolytic era.219
• Initiation of a ß-blocker immediately after STEMI, especially when it is associated
with LV systolic dysfunction, reduces the rate of hospitalisation for HF and
mortality.220
• Oral treatment with ß-blockers is recommended in patients with heart failure
and/or LV systolic dysfunction, unless contraindicated.220-224 ß-blockers may be
initiated when patients are haemodynamically stable.
• Routine oral treatment with ß-blockers should be considered during hospitalisation

ACE-Is and ARBs (Table 11, pg 80)
ACE-Is are indicated starting within the first 24 hours of STEMI in all patients
especially the high-risk patients (LVEF ≤ 40% or with evidence of heart failure,
diabetes or an anterior infarct). In these high risk patients, it should be continued
indefinitely if there are no contraindications.230-235
Contraindications to ACE-I and ARB therapy;
• SBP < 100 mmHg
• Established contraindications e.g. bilateral renal artery stenosis.
The dose of ACE-I/ARB should be reduced or stopped if there is:
• An increase in Scr of ≥ 30% from baseline within 2 weeks after initiation.236
• Persistent hyperkalaemia (> 5.6 mmol/L).
In ACE-I intolerant patients, an ARB may be used preferably valsartan.237,238
8.3.6
Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
Mineralocorticoid antagonists, e.g. eplerenone should be considered in patients post
MI with LVEF ≤ 40% and HF in the absence of renal failure or hyperkalaemia.239,240
Spironolactone has been mainly studied in patients with heart failure although
there has been a small study in STEMI.241 In this study in post STEMI patients, early

have contraindications or history of intolerance, regardless of initial cholesterol
values and continued indefinitely.242-245
• Target LDL-C should be <1.8mmol/L or a reduction of at least 50% from the
baseline, the lower the better.243,246,247
• Addition of non-statin therapy to reduce LDL-C should be considered in patients
who remain at high risk with LDL-C ≥1.8mmol/L despite the maximum tolerated
statin dose.248-250
• High loading or re-loading dose of statins have been shown to be beneficial in
preventing peri-procedural MI in ACS patients undergoing PCI.251-255

Nitrates (Table 12, pg 81)
• Oral nitrates are not routinely recommended.
• Nitrates can be considered in patients with:
 Continuing chest pain and / or ischaemia.
 HF
 Hypertension
• In the acute stage, IV nitrates are recommended because of their rapid onset
of action, ease of titration and potential for prompt termination in the event of
side effects. After the first 48 hours, oral or topical nitrates may be continued in
patients with persisting ischaemia and/or HF.
• Contraindications to nitrate therapy:
 Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg).
 RV infarction
 History of phospho-diesterase 5 inhibitor ingestion depending upon the halflife of the agent.

Key Recommendation 8:
• All patients with STEMI should receive medications that have been shown to
improve survival if given early. These include:

 ARBs if ACE-I intolerant
 ß-blockers
 Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRA)
 High dose statins.

9. Complications of STEMI
These are:
• Arrhythmias.
• LV dysfunction and shock.
• Mechanical complications.
• RV infarction.
• Others e.g. pericarditis.
9.1
Arrhythmias
These include:
A. Tachyarrhythmias
• Pulseless ventricular tachyarrhythmias
This is either pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).
Defibrillate immediately. Early VF occurs within the first 48 hours and is due to
electrical instability. Late VF is associated with large infarcts and poor pump
function and carries a poor prognosis (refer to algorithm 1, page 114).
• Ventricular tachycardia (VT)
VT in the setting of STEMI may arise from either ischaemia (usually within 48 hours)
or from a myocardial scar due to the infarct (late onset). Treatment of ischaemia
may result in the termination of the tachycardia (refer to algorithm 2, page 115).
• Ventricular premature contractions (VPC)
These are often benign and do not require treatment. Correct underlying ischaemia,
hypoxia and electrolyte disturbances.
• Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
These do not require any treatment. This is a sign suggestive of successful
reperfusion.
• Atrial fibrillation (AF)
This is more commonly seen in the elderly and is associated with large infarcts.
It denotes a poorer prognosis and carries an increased risk of thromboembolism
(refer to algorithm 3, page 116).
B. Bradyarrhythmias
These are:
• Sinus bradycardia
This does not require treatment unless associated with symptoms and/or
hypotension.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
85
• Atrio-ventricular (AV) block
 First degree and second degree type 1 (Mobitz 1) do not need treatment.
Patients with second degree type 2 (Mobitz 2) and complete AV block may
not require treatment if haemodynamically stable. If unstable, urgent temporary
pacing is necessary. Atropine may be given in the interim (maximum 3 mg) (refer
to algorithm 4, page 117).
 Patients with anterior infarcts who develop second degree (Mobitz 2) and
complete AV block carry a worse prognosis. Even if haemodynamically stable,
these patients require temporary pacing.
 In inferior MI, the inferior wall of the RV may be friable. Insertion of a temporary
wire may lead to RV perforation. Thus, extra care is required to prevent this
complication.
• Asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA)
Rhythms which require defibrillation (pulseless VT/VF) are called shockable
rhythms while asystole and PEA are non-shockable rhythms.
For the management of asystole and PEA, refer to algorithm 1, page 114.
9.2
LV dysfunction and cardiogenic shock
LV dysfunction is the single strongest predictor of mortality following STEMI. The
mechanisms responsible for acute LV dysfunction include myocardial necrosis,
myocardial stunning, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical causes such
as acute septal rupture and valvular dysfunction (pre-existing and/or new).
Co-morbidities such as infection, pulmonary disease, renal dysfunction, diabetes,
anaemia and drugs may aggravate HF.
9.2.1
Presentation
The clinical manifestation of LV dysfunction varies from asymptomatic to cardiogenic
shock. An important prognostic indicator is LVEF which can be assessed objectively
using echocardiography.
A useful clinical classification of LV dysfunction is the Killip's Classification.278 (Table
13, page 86)
9.2.2
Investigations
Echocardiography is an essential tool and needs to be performed early to assess LV
function and volumes, valvular function, extent of myocardial damage and to detect
mechanical complications.

Other investigations that may be helpful in the management include:
• Chest radiograph (to assess extent of pulmonary congestion).
• ECG (for the detection of arrhythmias, ischaemia or reinfarction).
• Arterial blood gases.

Management
A. Acute Heart Failure
Acute management includes the following:
• Oxygen – by nasal prongs/face mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%.
Consider non-invasive ventilation [bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] early if oxygen saturation cannot be
maintained with high flow face mask or high nasal cannula.
• Diuretics – IV frusemide.
• IV nitrates.
• Inotropes if hypotensive.
 Noradrenaline should be the agent of first choice. It is started at the lowest
dose and titrated until the SBP is more than 90mmHG and the mean arterial
pressure is at least 65 mmHg.281
 Dopamine should be avoided as it has been associated with a higher mortality
when used in patients with cardiogenic shock.116,117,281
 Adrenaline has been associated with a higher incidence of refractory shock
compared to noradrenaline and is best avoided.118
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
87
• In patients who are hypoxic or exhausted and are unable to achieve satisfactory
oxygen saturation despite non-invasive ventilation, endotracheal intubation and
ventilatory support may be required.
B. Cardiogenic shock
This condition occurs in 6–10% of all cases of STEMI and remains a leading cause
of death, with hospital mortality rates approaching 70%.282 With timely reperfusion
using primary PCI, mortality rates have decreased to about 50%.283
Criteria for the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock includes:281
• systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg for 30 minutes or mean arterial
pressure less than 65 mmHg for 30 minutes or vasopressors required to achieve a
systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg;
• pulmonary congestion or elevated left-ventricular filling pressures;
• signs of impaired organ perfusion with at least one of the following criteria:
 altered mental status.
 cold, clammy skin.
 oliguria.
 increased serum lactate.
Cardiogenic shock may not be present at admission but may develop in the first 48
hours following admission.283
Emergency PCI may be life-saving and should be considered early irrespective of
the time delay from onset of MI.281 If primary PCI cannot be performed within 2
hours, a pharmaco -invasive strategy with immediate fibrinolysis and transfer to a
PCI-capable centre is advised.
In management:
A. Inotropes – the inotrope of choice is noradrenaline titrated to maintain a mean
arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg.116-118, 281
B. Insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter may be helpful in the diagnosis and
management of these patients.
C. The use of IABP has not shown a definite benefit and its use should be
individualised.284,285
D. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit and LV assist device
may be considered for patients who do not respond to conventional therapies.
When cardiogenic shock is due to a mechanical defect, urgent surgical repair is
indicated. Concomitant CABG surgery in these patients remains an issue of debate.
The decision must be individualised.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
88
9.3
Mechanical complications
These include the following:
• Free wall rupture - it is usually fatal and presents with sudden cardiovascular
collapse and haemopericardium.
• Ventricular septal rupture.
• Mitral regurgitation.
The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with sudden clinical deterioration
and suggested by the presence of new murmurs or diminished heart sounds. The
diagnosis can be confirmed by echocardiography. In these patients, early surgery
should be considered.
Ventricular septal rupture requires urgent surgical or percutaneous closure, but there
is no agreement on the optimal timing for surgery.
9.4
Right Ventricular (RV) Infarct
Patients with RV infarct may have varying clinical presentation, from asymptomatic
to cardiogenic shock.17,286-288 Haemodynamically significant RV infarct complicates
approximately 5-10% of all STEMI. It occurs in 30 – 50% of patients with inferobasal (formerly known as infero-posterior) MI and is associated with a significantly
higher mortality.15,285 RV infarct can also occur in patients with anterior STEMI.17
9.4.1
Clinical diagnosis
The presence of RVI should be sought in all patients with inferior STEMI. The clinical
triad of hypotension, clear lung fields and elevated jugular venous pressure in the
setting of inferior STEMI is suggestive of RV infarct.
ST elevation in the right praecordial leads (V4R) is the most specific finding in
diagnosing RV infarct.18 However, this ECG finding may be transient, often resolving
within 8-10 hours.
9.4.2
Management
Treatment strategies depend on the severity of peripheral hypoperfusion and the
degree of co-existing LV dysfunction. Drugs that reduce the preload, such as nitrates
and diuretics should be avoided.
Management includes:
• Optimisation of IV fluids (saline or colloids) is the key therapy to correct the
hypotension.
• Inotropes.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
89
Failure to respond to these measures usually indicates concomitant LV dysfunction.
These patients require more aggressive management with afterload reducing agents
such as nitroprusside and IABP.
9.5
Others
9.5.1
Chest pain post-STEMI
Chest pain post-STEMI may be due to reinfarction, recurrent MI, ischaemia or
pericarditis. Non-cardiac causes must also be considered.
9.5.1.1 Reinfarction /Recurrent MI
In-hospital reinfarction occurred in about 3-4% of patients who had undergone
fibrinolytic therapy and received aspirin.289,290 Even in contemporary practice, with
primary PCI and DAPT, the incidence of reinfarction/recurrent MI is not infrequent
-1.8% at 30 days and 4% at 1 year.291 Reinfarction/Recurrent MI is associated with
a poor prognosis especially if it is due to stent thrombosis.291
Reinfarction may be diagnosed by:
• Recurrence of ischaemic type chest pain.
• Recurrence of ST segment elevation of at least 1mm in at least two contiguous
leads and/or
• Re - elevation of serum cardiac biomarkers - CK-MB or troponins (≥ 20% increase
in the value from the last sample).30,31
Death, severe HF and arrhythmias are more common in these patients. They should
be considered for rescue PCI.
9.5.1.2 Post-infarct angina
After successful reperfusion with fibrinolytic therapy, early recurrent angina may
occur in up to 20% of patients at 30 days.292 Among patients undergoing primary
PCI, 30% of patients reported angina at 6 weeks293 and about 10-20% continued to
have angina at 12-months.293-296
These patients have a higher risk of recurrent MI and mortality especially when
there are accompanying ECG and haemodynamic changes during the episodes of
angina.292 These patients should be:
• Sent for early coronary angiography with a view to revascularization.
• Treated optimally medically with anti-platelets, statins and anti-anginal
medications.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
90
9.5.1.3 Pericarditis
Pericarditis used to occur in about 20% of patients post STEMI and was associated
with a worse prognosis.297 In the contemporary era, however, it is an uncommon
complication (about 1.2%) and there was no difference in survival at 30 days, 1 and 5
years.298 It is usually associated with delayed presentations and bigger infarct size.298,299
Pericarditis may produce pain as early as the first day and as late as 6 weeks.297 The
pain classically becomes worse on deep inspiration and may be relieved when the
patient sits up and leans forward. A pericardial rub may be detected.
Dressler's syndrome (post-MI syndrome) usually occurs 2-10 weeks after STEMI.
This is immunologically mediated and used to occur in 3% to 4% of patients post
STEMI.299 In the contemporary era, it is seen in much fewer patients.300
Management includes:
• Aspirin 600 mg 3-4 times a day
• Acetaminophen or narcotic analgesics may be reasonable if aspirin, even in higher
doses, is not effective.
• Colchicine has been shown to reduce recurrences.300,301 However, there is
insufficient data on its use in the treatment of Dressler’s syndrome.300
• Glucocorticoids may be given if there are contraindications for aspirin and NSAIDs
or in the case of refractory symptoms.300,301
Only after stable remission with symptom resolution and normalisation of CRP
should the doses of aspirin, NSAIDs or glucocorticoids be tapered down slowly.301,302
9.5.2
LV thrombus and arterial embolism
The prevalence of LV mural thrombus has reduced from 20% to 2.7% in the era
of primary PCI.303,304 The majority of these occur following anterior or large infarcts
where the prevalence can be as high as 15%.305
The timing of LV thrombus assessment is important as too early an assessment
after the MI may not be able to detect the thrombus. Although two-thirds of the LV
thrombi were detected within the first week, an additional third were seen within the
first 3 months.305
Anti-coagulation therapy is recommended for 3-6 months or until the LV thrombus
disappears or organises on echocardiography.
9.5.3
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
In high-risk patients (prolonged bed rest, HF, unable to mobilise), prophylactic anticoagulation therapy (s.c. heparin 5000 units bd, LMWH – e.g. enoxaparin 40 mg od)
may be considered until the patient is ambulant.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
91
10. URGENT/EMERGENT CABG SURGERY
Urgent/emergent CABG surgery should be considered in the following situations:
• patients with a patent IRA but with unsuitable anatomy for PCI and either a large
myocardial area at jeopardy or with cardiogenic shock.96
• At the time of surgical repair of post-infarction ventricular septal rupture or mitral
valve regurgitation.
• Patients with failed reperfusion whose coronary anatomy and clinical profile are
suitable.
In general, CABG surgery in this group of patients carries a very high in-hospital
mortality rate.
11. RISK STRATIFICATION POST STEMI
Risk stratification of patients post-STEMI serves to prognosticate and identify
appropriate treatment strategies. It starts from admission and is a continuing
process. It is especially important in patients treated medically and those with
multivessel disease who underwent PCI of the IRA only.
11.1
Short-Term Risk
All patients with STEMI should have an early assessment of short-term risk. This can
be done using the STEMI TIMI or GRACE risk scores (Appendix III & IV, pg 120-122).82,83
In evaluating risk, the following are important considerations;
• an evaluation of the extent of myocardial damage,
• the occurrence of successful reperfusion, and
• the presence of clinical markers predictive of high risk of further CV events.
Assessment takes into consideration:
• older age,
• tachycardia,
• hypotension,
Key Messages #9:
• Important complications following STEMI are arrhythmias and HF.
• HF may be due to extensive myocardial damage or mechanical complications.
• Chest pain post STEMI may be due to:
 Reinfarction/Recurrent MI
 Post infarct angina
 Pericarditis
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
92
• Killip class >I,
• anterior MI,
• previous MI,
• elevated initial serum creatinine,
• history of heart failure
• peripheral arterial disease.
The GRACE score can also be used to predict both in-hospital and 6-month
mortality.306,307(Appendix IV, pg 121-122)
11.2
Long-Term Risk
All patients should also have an evaluation of long-term risk by assessing:
• LVEF – usually by ECHO
• residual ischaemia – usually by stress-testing,
• occurrence of complications during hospitalisation (eg: heart failure, malignant
arrythmias, mitral incompetence, septal rupture, LV aneurysms), and
• CV risk factors including:
 Lipid profile- As LDL-C levels tend to decrease during the first few days after MI,
they should be measured as soon as possible after admission.
 Plasma glucose
 Renal function.
Ideally, all patients with poor prognostic indicators (STEMI TIMI risk score ≥ 6.0) who
did not undergo primary PCI should have a coronary angiogram during the index
hospitalisation.82
All other patients who did not undergo coronary angiography should be risk stratified
early. This may be done by assessing:
• LV function by one or a combination of the following:
 Clinical examination,
 Chest X-ray,
 Echocardiogram,
 Radionuclide studies or
 Cardiac MRI
• Presence of myocardial ischaemia by one or a combination of the following:
 Clinical (recurrent angina).
 Exercise stress testing in asymptomatic patients- This may be done predischarge post-STEMI (sub-maximal stress test with a target heart rate of 70%
of maximum predicted heart rate) up to 6 weeks post-STEMI (maximal with a
target heart rate of 90% of maximum predicted heart rate for age or symptom
limited). If the pre-discharge sub-maximal stress test is negative, the patient
I,C
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
93
should be subjected to a maximal or symptom limited stress test within 6 weeks
after discharge.
 For those who cannot exercise, consider:
h Dobutamine stress echocardiogram, or;
h Radionuclide perfusion studies, or;
h Cardiac MRI
• Presence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.
STEMI patients who present initially to non PCI-capable hospitals should be referred
for early coronary angiography with a view to revascularization in the presence of
any of the following:
• Post-infarct angina,134
• Inducible ischaemia134
• Late ventricular arrhythmias
• In the presence of a depressed LV function (LVEF < 35%) and significant regional
wall motion abnormalities308
• STEMI TIMI risk score > 6.082 (Appendix III, pg 120)
In patients with poor LV function, myocardial viability studies (dobutamine stress
echocardiogram, radionuclide perfusion studies or cardiac MRI) can help to
differentiate scarred from viable ischaemic myocardium.
11.3
Sudden Cardiac Death
Patients with palpitations, near faints and syncope require comprehensive evaluation
to determine the cause of their symptoms and risk of sudden cardiac death. This
includes:
• Serum electrolytes.
• Resting ECG.
• 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording.
• Evaluation of LV function.
• Assessment for reversible myocardial ischaemia.
• Coronary angiography.
In these patients, reversible causes should be corrected.
In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, CABG has been shown to reduce CV
death and in particular sudden death.308
I,C
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
94
The following medications have been shown to reduce the incidence of sudden
death:
• ß-blockers.309,310
• ACE-I311
• MRA239
• Statins.312,313
In addition, the following patients should be considered for an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD):
• Secondary prevention in patients with resuscitated sudden cardiac death.314-316
• Primary prevention in patients with LV dysfunction [ejection fraction (EF)
< 30%]. ICD may be considered 40 days post-STEMI and 3 months post-
revascularization.317-319
Key Recommendation 9:
• All patients post-STEMI should be risk-stratified either clinically or by using
the STEMI TIMI and/or GRACE risk scores.
• STEMI patients who present initially to non PCI-capable hospitals should be
referred for early coronary angiography with a view to revascularization in the
presence of any of the following:
 Post-infarct angina
 Inducible ischaemia
 Late ventricular arrhythmias
 In the presence of a depressed LV function (LVEF ≤ 35%) and significant
regional wall motion abnormalities
 STEMI TIMI risk score ≥ 6.0 (Appendix III, pg 120)

12. DURATION OF HOSPITALISATION
The duration of hospital stay following STEMI will depend on the patient’s cardiac
risk, extent of myocardial damage, presence of complications, comorbidities and
social support.
Early (same day) transfer to the referring centres may be considered in selected lowrisk uncomplicated patients after successful primary PCI.320
Asymptomatic, low risk patients with uncomplicated STEMI may be discharged on
day 2 or day 3 after successful primary PCI and complete revascularization.321-327
Patients with significant LV dysfunction or other complications may require a longer
hospital stay.
13. SECONDARY PREVENTION
13.1
Non-Pharmacological Measures
Important lifestyle interventions include:
• cessation of smoking,
• dietary modification,
• weight control and
• physical activity.
Often, lifetime habits are not easily changed and team work between cardiologists
and general practitioners, rehabilitative physicians, pharmacists, dieticians,
physiotherapists and occupational therapists is needed for implementation and
follow-up.
13.1.1. Cessation of Smoking
Smoking cessation has been consistently associated with a mortality benefit and it
is one of the cornerstones of secondary prevention.328,329
In a cohort of patients with ACS on optimal secondary prevention therapy, those
who continued to smoke had an 80% risk of lower survival at a mean follow-up of
3.9 years while those who quit had comparable survival to lifelong non-smokers.330
Persistent smokers at 30 days post-PCI experienced an almost twofold increase in
long-term mortality.330
This underscores the importance of smoking cessation in secondary prevention
despite the improvement in management of ACS with PCI and pharmacotherapy.
This also emphasises the malignant pathophysiological effects of smoking, namely
I,A
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
96
endothelial dysfunction, thrombogenicity and coronary vasoconstriction, which
predispose to ACS.331
13.1.1.1 Smoking Cessation Interventions
Smoking cessation is difficult, even after life-threatening ACS. The Melbourne
Registry showed that only 54% of patients stopped smoking by 30 days.330 Almost
23% of those who quit smoking at 30 days had relapsed at 12 months highlighting
the difficulty of long-term abstinence.330,332
Hospitalisation for an acute cardiovascular event provides a unique window of
opportunity to encourage patients to quit smoking. A study has shown that the
majority of successful quitters at 1 year stopped immediately after their ACS.333
However, smoking-cessation therapy in hospitalised patients offers challenges.
The duration of hospitalisation for acute myocardial infarction is usually brief and
hospital stay is busy, making it difficult to gain the patient’s full attention for smokingcessation counselling. Nevertheless, effective counselling in the hospital should be
provided for all smokers, and not just the minority who are ready to quit.334 Effective
transition from inpatient to outpatient smoking cessation treatment should take
place, with a minimum of 1-month follow-up.334 MQuit (Quit smoking) Services is
currently available in all health clinics (Klinik Kesihatan) throughout the country.
13.1.1.2 Pharmacotherapy
Post-STEMI patients usually have been chronic smokers and most of them would
have high degree of nicotine dependency. Thus, they should be given personalised
smoking cessation medication intended to relieve withdrawal symptoms and to
support long-term cessation.
However, very low rates of these medications are prescribed post-MI, and this rate
has declined over time.335 Some clinicians are hesitant to add a smoking-cessation
medication on top of a number of other medications that have been initiated or
continued. All smoking cessation interventions (nicotine replacement therapy,
varenicline and bupropion) have been shown to be safe in cardiac patients.336,337
For further details of smoking cessation, please refer to the Malaysian Clinical
Practice Guidelines on Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease, 1st Ed, 2017.338
13.1.2 Diet and Weight Control
Current guidelines on secondary CV prevention recommend:338,339
• A diet similar to the Mediterranean diet, which includes a maximum of 10%
of total energy intake from saturated fat, replacing it wherever possible with
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
97
polyunsaturated fatty acids and to consume as little as possible of trans fatty
acids;
• Salt intake of < 5 g per day;
• 30–45 g fibre per day;
• ≥ 200 g fruits and 200 g vegetables per day;
• Fish 1–2 times per week (especially oily varieties);
• 30 g unsalted nuts daily;
• Limited alcohol intake [maximum of 2 glasses (20 g of alcohol) daily for men and
1 for women];
• Discouraging sugar-sweetened drinks.
Overweight and obesity is associated with higher all-cause mortality compared with
a healthy weight.340
Thus, maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight is recommended for all subjects
including patients with STEMI.340 However, it has not been established that weight
reduction per se reduces mortality.
13.1.3 Regular Exercise
There is increasing evidence that, when adequately prescribed and supervised,
regular exercise after an MI can prevent future complications and increase the
quality of life and longevity of these patients338,341,342
Any amount of physical activity (PA) is better than none; adults engaging in any form
and amount of PA gain some form of health benefits in both primary and secondary
prevention.338,342
Following an acute cardiac event or post cardiac surgery, patients should be referred
to a cardiac rehabilitative physician for exercise prescription.
For a more detailed discussion on physical activity and exercise prescription, refer
to the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines on Primary and Secondary Prevention
of Cardiovascular Disease, 1st Ed, 2017.338
13.2
Control of CV Risk Factors
13.2.1 Control of hypertension
The prognosis is affected by both the pre-existing and the subsequent BP. The
higher the pre-existing BP, the higher the fatality rate.343
After ACS, the target BP is 110 to < 140/ < 90mmHg (using standard, routine clinician
office measurements).344,345
I,B
I,A
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
98
Drugs of choice include ß-blockers, ACE-Is and ARB (if ACE-I intolerant).346-348
In addition, lifestyle modification (reduced salt intake, increased physical activity and
weight loss) usually help achieve these goals.349-351
Please refer to Malaysian CPG on Primary and Secondary prevention of
Cardiovascular Disease, 1st Ed, 2017 and Malaysian CPG on Hypertension, 4th Ed,
2018.338,344
13.2.2. Good glycaemic control (see also Section 14.2, pg 103)
After STEMI, diabetic patients have a high risk of subsequent CVD events, including
another MI, stroke, and death. While it is imperative to achieve good blood glucose
control, glycaemic control should be individualised.352,353
Those with long duration of diabetes, known history of severe hypoglycaemia,
advanced atherosclerosis, or advanced age/frailty may benefit from less aggressive
targets. However, in type 2 diabetes, there is evidence that more intensive treatment
of glycaemia (without causing hypoglycaemia) in newly diagnosed patients may
reduce long-term CVD rates.

Pharmacotherapy for Secondary Prevention (see also Section 8.3,
pg 74-83)
Medications that have been proven to improve CV outcomes long term post STEMI
include:
A. Anti-platelet agents:
• Aspirin - low dose aspirin 75-100 mg daily indefinitely38,39
• A P2Y12 inhibitor –
 Clopidogrel
h A component of DAPT in patients who underwent a:
~ Fibrinolytic strategy41,42
~ Primary PCI strategy40,192
h As an alternative in aspirin intolerant individuals354
 Ticlopidine- As an alternative to aspirin intolerant individuals198,199
 Ticagrelor-
h A component of DAPT in patients who:
~ underwent a primary PCI strategy76,77,197
~ are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events. The dose of ticagrelor was
60 mg twice daily and it was given for up to 3 years.206 The benefit was
partially offset by a small increased risk of bleeding.206
 Prasugrel- A component of DAPT in patients who underwent a primary PCI
strategy.148,195
B. Statins
• Statins have been shown to improve prognosis in patients with stable CAD, the
lower the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) achieved, the better the CV
outcome.242-245
• There appears to be a dose-dependent reduction in CVD with LDL-C lowering; the
greater the LDL-C reduction, the greater the CV risk reduction.
• The target LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/l- the lower the better.242,243,245
• If LDL-C levels cannot be achieved, the additional use of other non-statin therapy
(e.g. ezetimibe, PCSK-9 inhibitors) may be considered.248-250
• In patients who have achieved LDL-C but the TG remains elevated (1.52-5.63mmol/l)
the use of a TG lowering agent, icosapent ethyl 2 g twice daily, was superior to
placebo in reducing TGs, CV events, and CV death.355
C. ß-blockers
• Oral treatment with ß-blockers is indicated in all patients post STEMI especially in
those with HF or LV dysfunction.220,226,227
• Evidence supporting the use of ß-blockers > 1- year post STEMI for the treatment
of stable CAD is less well established.228,229,356,357

D. ACE-Is and ARBs
• ACE-Is/ARBs are indicated starting within the first 24 hours of STEMI in highrisk patients (LVEF ≤ 40% or who have experienced HF in the early phase,
DM or an anterior infarct) and should be continued indefinitely if there are no
contraindications.230-234,237,238
• ACEi/ARB do not have any additional benefits in reducing CV events and death in
patients with Stable CAD and preserved LV function.358-361
• Thus routine use of ACEi/ARB > 1 year post-STEMI is not recommended.358-361
E. MRA
• Mineralocorticoid antagonists, e.g. eplerenone should be considered in patients
with LVEF ≤ 40% and HF in the absence of renal failure or renal impairment.239
F. DOAC
• The use of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin 100 mg daily
in high risk post-MI patients, significantly reduced the risk of major CV events at a
mean follow up of 2 years (the composite of CV death, stroke, or MI) compared to
aspirin alone but the risk of major bleeding was also significantly higher.362
G. Anti-ischaemic Therapy
In patients who continue to have angina post revascularization, the following may
be considered:363
• ß-blockers and/or CCBs should be prescribed as first-line treatment to reduce
angina because it is widely available.
• Ivabradine, trimetazidine, long-acting nitrates and ranolazine are recommended
as add-on therapy in patients who remain symptomatic.

Key Recommendation 10:
• Post STEMI, all patients should receive secondary prevention interventions
that have been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular event rate.
These include:
 smoking cessation and other lifestyle changes
 regular exercise
 control of CV risk factors- hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidaemia
 drug therapy;
h anti-platelet agents
h statins therapy
h ß-blockers:
◊ < 1 year in all patients
◊ > 1 year in the presence of LVEF ≤ 40%
h ACE-I/ARB:
◊ < 1 year in all patients
◊ > 1 year in the presence of LVEF ≤ 40%, anterior infarct and diabetes
14. SPECIAL GROUPS
14.1
STEMI in Older Individuals
Patients above the age of 75 years have much higher in-hospital as well as 1-year
mortality.364-367 This may be explained by their atypical and delayed presentations,
multiple co-morbidities and under-utilisation of reperfusion strategies.368,369 Diagnosis
may be delayed because of:
• Atypical symptoms such as dyspnoea, syncope and acute delirium and confusion
in the presence of pre-existing cognitive impairment.365,366
• Non-diagnostic and difficult to interpret ECGs complicated by an abnormal
baseline.
• Non-diagnostic cardiac biomarkers. The baseline troponin levels may be elevated
in as many as 22% of the elderly without an MI because of pre-existing cardiac
and renal disease.370,371 Thus, a high index of suspicion must be present to make a
diagnosis of ACS in older individuals. The trend of a rise and fall cardiac biomarker
levels is critical to the diagnosis.
Management
Evidence for risk benefit ratio for interventions in older patients is scarce as they
were largely excluded from most of the large trials and data is mainly derived from
post-hoc analysis.365,372 In determining the appropriate management for this group,
one should consider the heterogeneity of this population and consider the biological
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
102
age rather than the chronological age of the patient. Therefore, the risk-benefit ratio
of each intervention should be individualised so that these patients are not excluded
from interventions.373 It is important to assess frailty, general health and functional
status, co-morbidities as well as the particular wishes of the patient and family.
In addition, age related differences in physiology can affect disease manifestation,
bleeding risks, drug metabolism and management. Most MI’s in older patients
are NSTEMI rather than STEMI.374 Older patients are more likely to develop left
ventricular failure (more than 50% of those aged > 75 years of age) and more than
>10% develop cardiogenic shock.374,375 This is due to their more extensive disease,
late presentation, and age-related changes in cardiac physiology or decreased
vascular compliance, ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling.375,376
CKD is common in these patients and may increase the risk of bleeding.375,376 Most
drugs are excreted by the kidneys and doses need to be adjusted. Creatinine
clearance (CrCL) should be estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault and the estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology Collaboration) equations or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) equations. (Appendix VI, pg 124).
In the management of STEMI in older patients:
• Primary PCI - this is the preferred reperfusion strategy if facilities are available
and the patient is eligible for PCI.376-381 Procedural success is highly variable. Older
patients are more likely to have PCI related complications especially bleeding.382
• Fibrinolytic therapy - there is an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage in
older patients and the risks of bleeding have to be carefully considered in those
older than 75 years.383--386 The dose of tenecteplase is 50% of the recommended
dose in those ≥ 75 years of age.387
• Adjunctive therapy - when compared with younger patients, older patients
have a greater absolute reduction with most evidence based medications.365 It is
important to balance the risks of polypharmacy and the risks of drug interactions
with the benefit of not withholding guideline-directed medications, proven to be
of benefit in these older individuals. While in-hospital mortality and complication
rates increased with advancing age, those receiving more recommended therapies
had lower mortality than those who did not receive these medications.388
 Aspirin - at a dose of 75 to 150 mg in the absence of contraindications.365,389,390
 Clopidogrel - the absolute benefits of clopidogrel are similar, but relative
benefits are less in older patients.192,365 Patients undergoing PCI with higher
STEMI TIMI risk scores or prior revascularization are more likely to benefit.391
A loading dose when compared to a conventional dose of clopidogrel did not
result in an increased bleeding risk in older patients.194 The need for a loading
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
103
dose needs however, to be individualised. When given as part of a fibrinolytic
strategy, the loading dose in patients > 75 years is 75 mg.42
 Ticagrelor – ticagrelor has a similar efficacy as clopidogrel in patients aged ≥
75 years of age and those < 75 years of age. There was no increased risk of
bleeding.77
 Prasugrel - should be avoided in patients > 75 years of age.195,196
 Enoxaparin was found to be more effective than UFH, the absolute risk
reductions for the composite end points of death and non-fatal MI at 30 days
was the same in both younger and older patients.208 The risk of bleeding was
higher in those > 75 years even with the reduced dose.208 (Table 9, pg 78)
• Secondary prevention - the benefit associated with the use of ß-blockers,
ACE-Is and statins is similar to, and often greater than, that observed in younger
patients.392-399
• Cardiac rehabilitation- Older patients benefit from cardiac rehabilitation and
exercise training.400-405 It is a combination of secondary preventive efforts and
improving their functional capacity.
• Risk stratification - this needs to be individualised and patient preferences
are important in determining further management. The presence of on-going
ischaemia, symptomatic malignant arrhythmias and a depressed LV function are
poor prognostic indicators and would generally necessitate a more aggressive
approach. Both PCI and CABG, when indicated, can be carried out in older
patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality by experienced operators. The
risks are however higher than in younger patients.
14.2
STEMI in diabetics
In patients with STEMI, the blood glucose level was associated with adverse
outcomes independent of prior diabetic status.406,407 Following an ACS, patients with
diabetes unlike those without diabetes, do not have similar reductions in CV mortality
despite receiving modern therapies.408-410 The rate of successful reperfusion of the
infarct related vessel treated with fibrinolytic regimens is similar in both diabetics
and non-diabetics. Despite this, diabetics have a worse prognosis and they require
almost 50% more time to achieve satisfactory ST-segment elevation recovery.411
Local NCVD registry data indicate that diabetics with STEMI did worse than would
be expected from their STEMI TIMI risk score.81
Patients with diabetes may have atypical presentations and this may contribute to
their late presentation. They also tend to have more diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
Management
Diabetic patients should be treated in a similar manner as non-diabetics.
• Primary PCI is the reperfusion strategy of choice in these high-risk patients.412
• Adjunctive therapy includes:
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
104
 Anti-platelet agents – aspirin and clopidogrel or prasugrel or ticagrelor.38,39,40,76,148
 Prasugrel has been found to be more effective in diabetics.148
Diabetes is a well-recognised risk factor for contrast induced nephropathy (CIN).413
In the setting of STEMI, an elevated pre-procedural glucose level is associated with
a greater risk for CIN even in patients without known diabetes.413
There is still a lack of consensus on the optimal management of blood sugars during
the acute event.414-416 Intensive insulin therapy to achieve normoglycaemia in the
acute setting has not been shown to reduce mortality and is associated with an
increase in the episodes of hypoglycaemia. A low blood sugar level (< 4.0 mmol/L)
has also been associated with adverse outcomes.
A general consensus is to keep blood sugars between 6-10 mmol/L in the acute
setting and then aim for optimal control following discharge.417,418
• In the pharmacotherapy of diabetic patients with CAD:
 Both the SGLT2i and the GLP-1 agonists have been shown to be associated
with a reduction in the risk of CV composite end-points.419-423
 The SGLT2i have been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure.419,422,423
 In a meta-analysis, the SGLT2i and GLP-1 agonists have been associated with
a reduction in all cause mortality.424
 thiazolidinediones are associated with an increase in the incidence of heart
failure and should be avoided in those in NYHA Functional class 3 & 4.425-427
 Saxagliptin, a DPP-4i, was also shown to be associated with an increase in
hospitalization for heart failure.427 However this is not seen with the other agents
of the same class.428
 Sulphonylureas, biguanides like metformin and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors
like acarbose are generally safe.
14.3
STEMI in women
Women have a higher mortality following STEMI.429-440 They are generally about
10 years older when they develop CHD and have more comorbidities. They were
also less likely to undergo angiography, reperfusion and receive less medical
treatment.430,439
This gender difference in 30-day mortality was not seen if the analysis was adjusted
for both baseline characteristics and treatment especially for Primary PCI. Women
below 60 years however, had a higher mortality despite multivariable adjustment for
both comorbidities and treatment effects.430,440 Women are more likely to present
with cardiogenic shock.433,434
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
105
Women tend to have atypical symptoms and generally do not present with classical
ischaemic-type chest pain.431 They are more likely to have fatigue, neck pain,
syncope, nausea, right arm pain, dizziness and jaw pain.431 Subjective reports of
sleep disturbance preceding MI seem to be common in women.432 Thus a high
degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to diagnose MI in women.
Management
In general, women should be treated the same as men taking into consideration the
following:389,390,441
• Primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy. Women however, have higher
early all-cause and cardiac mortality after primary PCI and they also have higher
bleeding risk.434 Women are less likely to undergo coronary angiography and
reperfusion and those who underwent primary PCI tend to have longer DBT.434
• Women given fibrinolytics [recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (r-TPA)]
had a higher incidence but lower mortality from bleeding than men.442
• Adjunctive therapy is similar in both gender.443-445 Women however have higher
bleeding risk.
• Cardiac rehabilitation – women, especially older women, are under-referred for
cardiac rehabilitation.446,447 Efforts should be initiated to overcome these barriers.448
• Continuing HRT after STEMI does not confer a benefit nor pose a worrisome
increase in risk. When considering the need for HRT for menopausal symptoms,
clinical judgement is necessary.449,450
Key messages #12:
• Diagnosis of STEMI in the elderly, diabetics and women is difficult and a high
index of suspicion is important.
• Treatment is the same although the elderly and women tend to have higher
bleeding risk.

14.4
STEMI in renal disease
Patients with all grades of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Appendix VI, pg 124) have
a worse prognosis after an MI compared to those with normal renal function; those
on dialysis may have as high as 74% mortality at 2 years.81,451-457 The serum creatinine
(Scr) at admission predicts long-term mortality even after successful primary PCI.451
One in 6 survivors develop worsening renal function during the admission and this is
also associated with increased mortality even in patients with normal renal function
at baseline.457
Patients with CKD tend to:458-461
• be older.
• have more comorbidities such as diabetes.
• be on more cardio-protective medications.
• have more extensive coronary atherosclerosis with a higher plaque burden.
• have culprit lesions which are more proximal and threatening a larger myocardial
volume.
• be more likely to present without chest pain.
• be in Killip Class III or IV.
• present as NSTEMI.
Troponins may be elevated in patients with CKD even in the absence of ACS.462 A rise
and fall in cardiac biomarkers is essential to make a diagnosis of MI. Small studies
seem to indicate that Troponin I may be more specific for myocardial necrosis than
Troponin T in CKD.463
Management
Reperfusion Strategy:
The optimal mode of reperfusion in patients with CKD presenting with STEMI has not
been addressed in large prospective trials. The best strategy in patients with severe
CKD and those on dialysis is still unclear.464-468 Registry data seem to indicate that
the benefits of reperfusion is uncertain in this population.464-469
In patients receiving fibrinolytics, there are no dose adjustment recommendations
for the use of streptokinase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase in patients with
CKD. However, the risk of intracranial haemorrhage is increased.470
The success rate of emergency PCI in patients with CKD is generally lower and
can result in worsening renal function due to haemodynamic instability and CIN.471
Patients with CKD tend to have more extensive atherosclerosis and more complex
calcified lesions.471 In some patients with multivessel coronary involvement and
haemodynamic instability, complete revascularization by CABG may be superior to
PCI.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
107
CIN is higher among patients undergoing primary PCI as compared to elective
procedures. It occurs in as high as 20-30% of cases and is associated with adverse
1- year mortality.472 Half of these patients may go on to develop persistent renal
failure.473 Recent studies have shown high-dose statin therapy to reduce the
incidence of CIN but more studies are needed to confirm these findings.474-476
Adjunctive therapy:
Patients with CKD were excluded from most clinical trials and most of the available
data is derived from post-hoc analyses. These patients have higher rates of bleeding
and the doses of antithrombotic agents need to be adjusted accordingly.477 (Table
15, pg 108)
The Cockcroft -Gault (CG) equation has traditionally been used for drug dosing
based on CrCL. In recent practice, the CKD-EPI Creatinine (CKD-EPI) has been used
for drug dosing based on eGFR especially for newer generation drugs. Drug dosing
adjustment, however, should be done according to the United States Food and Drug
Administration or the European Medicine Agency approved drug labelling.
• Anti-platelet therapy:
 Standard care: aspirin 75-100 mg478,479 and clopidogrel 75 mg.478 In patients on
dialysis, aspirin did not result in an increase in bleeding risk.480,481
 In patients with mild to moderate CKD who underwent primary PCI, a 600 mg
loading dose of clopidogrel was not found to be beneficial.482-484 This dose
however did not increase the in-hospital major bleeding rate.482-484
 Both ticagrelor and prasugrel were shown to be more effective than clopidogrel
in patients with normal and reduced renal function without an increased risk of
major bleeding.195,485
• Anti-thrombotic therapy:
 Enoxaparin was found to more effective than UFH in patients with mild to
moderate CKD.486,487 In patients with CrCL < 30 ml/minute, enoxaparin has been
associated with an increased risk of bleeding.477
 Fondaparinux - in patients with mild to moderate CKD, fondaparinux was more
effective than enoxaparin largely explained by the lower rates of bleeding.488
However, it should be avoided in patients with CrCL < 30 ml/minute.
• ß-blocker, ACE- I and statin therapy:
 In patients with mild to moderate CKD, meta-analyses and post-hoc analyses
of studies have noted benefits.477,489-493 In patients on ACE-I, renal function and
potassium should be monitored.
 In patients on dialysis, there is a lack of evidence concerning the cardiovascular
benefits of statins.493 Aspirin, ß-blockers and ACE-Is however, remain
beneficial.494

are high.
• In view of bleeding risks, the dosages of anti-platelet agents and antithrombotics need to be adjusted accordingly.
• Aspirin, ß- blockers, ACE-I and statins are beneficial in patients with mild to

remain beneficial.

15. CARDIAC REHABILITATION
Cardiac Rehabilitation Programme (CRP) consists of coordinated, multifaceted
interventions designed to optimise a cardiac patient’s physical, psychological, and
social functioning.495-497 It is a comprehensive, long-term program involving:
• medical evaluation,
• exercise prescriptions,
• cardiac risk-factor modification,
• education and counseling
The core components of CRP are:496,497
• Healthy behaviour changes and education
• Lifestyle risk factor management
• Physical activity and exercise
• Diet
• Smoking cessation
• Psychosocial health
• Medical risk factor management
• Long-term management
• Audit and evaluation
CRP can be initiated once the patient is stable and out of the critical care unit and
before discharge from hospital.
There are 4 Phases using the Wenger Model:498
• Acute phase (Phase I):
 This is the in-hospital period immediately following the MI and leading up to
discharge.
 It involves early mobilization of the patient.
 It can be started after 48 hours of hospitalisation in stable patients.
• Convalescent phase (Phase II):
 This is at home/convalescent hospital.
 This continues the program started in phase I until the myocardial scar has
matured.
• Training phase (Phase III):
 This is initiated after healing is complete (about 4 to 6 weeks) and the patient is
safe for aerobic exercise.
• Maintenance (Phase IV):
 This is home-based regular exercise to maintain aerobic conditioning gains
made in phase III.
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST
SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION (STEMI) 2019
110
Exercise training programs include warm-up, resistance training, endurance training,
and cool-down. Examples:
1. Warm-up: stretching, warm-up exercise, low-intensity (slow) walking
2. Main exercises: aerobic exercise and resistance training at prescribed
intensity
3. Cool-down: low-intensity (slow) walking, stretching, cooling-down exercise
For patients at High Risk during Cardiac Rehabilitation and contraindications to
exercise training see Tables 17 & 18, pg 111-112.
Sexual counselling is advisable.499 In general, sexual activity may be resumed one
week after uncomplicated STEMI in the absence of cardiac symptoms after mild
to moderate physical activity.500 In the presence of complications, it should be
individualised.
There is no unanimous consensus as when to resume driving after STEMI. In general,
for:501-503
• Private drivers:
 After one month if no complications and LVEF >35%.
 In those with complications such as LVEF <35%, acute decompensated heart
failure, arrhythmias etc- it may be longer.
• Commercial drivers:
 should be assessed at 3 months post-STEMI for fitness to resume duties.504
Criteria include:
h Stress test (exercise tolerance of greater than 9 minutes (stage 3) on the
Bruce Treadmill Test
h Less than 2 mm ST segment depression on an exercise ECG (stress test)
h LVEF must be > 40%.

16. CHECKLISTS FOR FOLLOW-UP VISITS
The following should be assessed at each follow-up visit:
• Assess the presence or absence of cardiac symptoms and determine the
functional class of the patient.
• Evaluate patients’ psychosocial (anxiety & depression) status and the social
integration and support network.
• Review pre-discharge risk assessment and evaluate:
 Presence of residual ischaemia.
 LV function.
 Current medications and optimize their doses.
• Treat to target.
 BP: < 140/90 mmHg.
 Lipids: LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L, the lower the better.
 Diabetic control: targets should be individualised.
 Achieve and maintain ideal body weight and waist circumference.

Outcome Measures indicators include:
• In hospital mortality < 10%
• 30-day mortality < 14%
• 1-year mortality < 18%
Key Recommendation 11:
• Regular audit of performance measures (Table 19, pg 113) and outcomes
measures are important to monitor and improve quality of care.
17. PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Performance measures should be used with the goal of improving the quality of
care.506
Process performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to
a patient, while outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or
repeat hospitalisation.

CPR Quality
• Push hard (at least 2 inches [5
cm]) and fast (100-120/min) and
allow complete chest recoil.
• Minimize interruptions in
compressions.
• Avoid excessive ventilation.
• Rotate compressor every 2
minutes, or sooner if fatigued.
• If no advanced airway, 30:2
compression -ventilation ratio.
• Quantitative waveform
capnography
- If PETC02<10 mm Hg, attempt
to improve CPR quality.
• Intra-arterial pressure
- If relaxation phase (dia-stolic)
pressure <20 mm Hg,attempt to
improve CPR quality.
Shock Energy for Defibrillation
• Biphasic: Manufacturer
recommendation (eg, initial dose
of 120-200 J); if unknown, use
maximum available. Second and
subsequent
doses should be equivalent, and

APPENDICES
APPENDIX I: DIFFICULTIES IN ECG DIAGNOSIS OF MI
The following conditions may cause ECG changes that may be confused with
that of STEMI:
• Prior MI with Q-waves and/or persistent ST elevation.
• Early repolarisation.
• LBBB.
• Right ventricular pacing.
• Pre-excitation.
• Peri-/myocarditis.
• Pulmonary embolism.
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage.
• Metabolic disturbances such as hyperkalaemia.
• Cardiomyopathy.
• Cholecystitis.
• Tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines.
• J point elevation syndromes, e.g. Brugada syndrome.
In these difficult situations where the ECG is non-diagnostic, cardiac imaging
techniques such as echocardiogram looking for presumed new wall motion
abnormalities or elevation of cardiac biomarkers will help in making the
diagnosis.

APPENDIX VI: Calculation of Creatine Clearance and GFR for drug dosing
adjustments
Creatinine clearance (Cr Cl) is determined by the Cockcroft -Gault (CG) Equation
whereas eGFR can be derived from various equations including most commonly,
the CKD-EPI Creatinine (CKD -EPI) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study
(MDRD) Equations.
In a local population, CKD-EPI performs just as well as CKD-MDRD for GFR 6089ml/min and better at the other GFR levels.507
Equations for Estimation of Renal Function
i. 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation =
141 x min (Scr/k,1)α x max (Scr/k,1)-1.209 x 0.993Age [x 1.018 if
female] [x 1.159 if black], where Scr is serum creatinine (in mg/
dl), k is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is -0.329 for females
and -0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/k or 1,
and max indicates the maximum of Scr/k or 1
ii. Cockcroft -Gault Creatinine Clearance =
CrCI (ml/min/1.73 m2) = (140 - age (yrs)) x body weight (kg)/SCr
(umoI/I) x Constant where the constant is 1.23 in male or 1.04 in
female
