STATEMENT OF INTENT
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are meant to be guides for
clinical practice, based on the best available evidence at the time of
development. Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily
guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is
responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the
clinical picture presented by the patient and the management options
available locally.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
UPDATING THE CPG
These guidelines were issued in 2019 and will be reviewed in a minimum
period of four years (2023) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When
it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of
the related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done
on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A
multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review
methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.
Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every
detail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or
omissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this
document, which is the definitive version at all times. This version can
be found on the websites mentioned above.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations were highlighted by the CPG
Development Group as the key clinical recommendations that should
be prioritised for implementation.
Diagnosis and Investigation
• Consider rheumatoid arthritis if inflammation involving multiple joints
is present for at least six weeks.
• Inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor ± anti-citrullinated
peptide antibody should be tested when there is clinical suspicion of
rheumatoid arthritis.
Referral
• All patients suspected of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should be
referred to the rheumatologist.
• All RA patients should be primarily managed by rheumatologists.
 Co-management plan with primary healthcare providers may be
offered subsequently.
Treatment
• Aim to achieve a state of clinical remission or at least low disease
activity within six months using a treat-to-target strategy in rheumatoid
arthritis.
• Patient education should be included in the management of
rheumatoid arthritis.
• Short term low-dose corticosteroids may be used in active rheumatoid
arthritis.
• Methotrexate should be used as the first-line Disease Modifying
Anti-Rheumatic Drug in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis unless
contraindicated.

FORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION
In line with new development in CPG methodology, the CPG Unit of
MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) in its work process. The
quality of each retrieved evidence and its effect size are carefully
assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group. In formulating
the recommendations, overall balances of the following aspects are
considered in determining the strength of the recommendations:-
• overall quality of evidence
• balance of benefits versus harms
• values and preferences
• resource implications
• equity, feasibility and acceptability
Level
I
II-1
II-2
II-3
III
Study design
Evidence from at least one properly randomised controlled trial
Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without
randomisation
Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control
analytic studies, preferably from more than one centre or
group
Evidence from multiple time series with or without intervention;
dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the
results of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s)
could also be regarded as this type of evidence
Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience;
descriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert
committees

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The members of the Development Group (DG) for these CPG were
from the Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Education (MoE) and
private sector. There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary
Review Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development.
A systematic literature search was carried out using the following
electronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and
Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed
and Guidelines International Network (G-I-N). Refer to Appendix 1 for
Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion criteria were all patients
with rheumatoid arthritis regardless of study design. The search was
limited to literature published in the last 15 years and on humans and
in English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and
guidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify
relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 29 May 2017 to 2
June 2017. Literature search was repeated for all clinical questions at
the end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers
published before 31 January 2019 to be included. Future CPG updates
will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details
of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG
Secretariat.
Reference was also made to other guidelines as listed below:
• Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults: Management [National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), July 2018]
• Management of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis [Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network (SIGN), February 2011]
The CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for
Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as reference.
A total of seven main clinical questions were developed under different
sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions
within these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions.
The DG members met 19 times throughout the development of these
guidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG
members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented
in evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All
statements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed
upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the
recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any
differences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was
based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and
clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
iv
The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/
Canadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)
while the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of
GRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows
strictly the requirement of AGREE II.
On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It
was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from
any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical
Advisory Committee for CPG, and the Health Technology Assessment
(HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and approval. Details
on the CPG development by MaHTAS can be obtained from Manual on
Development and Implementation of Evidence-based Clinical Practice
Guidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh.gov.my/

1. INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune
disease which primarily affects the joints. It is characterised by
uncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue and a wide array of
multisystem co-morbidities. The disease has an insidious onset
with unpredictable and variable courses. Typically, RA manifests
as symmetrical polyarthritis but may also present with non-specific
symptoms e.g. fatigue, malaise and mild fever. Bone erosion,
destruction of cartilage and complete loss of joint integrity can occur
over time if treatment is delayed or inadequate.
Numerous multicentre international studies have shown that disease
progression can be minimised with early and appropriate treatment.
Treatment paradigm of RA has evolved over the last two decades with
the advent of biologics and implementation of treat-to-target (T2T)
strategy.
The Malaysian National Inflammatory Arthritis Registry (NIAR) reported
that there is often a delay in RA diagnosis as only about 50% of cases
are diagnosed within a year of the symptom onset. This may be due to
a lack of awareness and understanding of the disease among public
and healthcare providers. Furthermore, limited human, financial and
infrastructure resources may also contribute to the difficulty of accessing
rheumatology care.4
This is the first national CPG on the management of RA aimed to
increase awareness among healthcare providers on the importance of
recognizing early RA, timely referral to rheumatologist and initiation of
treatment. We hope that this CPG will foster close collaboration between
various stakeholders in providing evidence-based management of RA
to improve outcomes and ultimately patients’ quality of life (QoL).
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
2. CLINICAL FEATURES
Clinical features of RA can be divided into articular and extra-articular
manifestations. Extra-articular features may involve multiple organs
including the skin, eyes, lungs and blood vessels. Non-specific systemic
features such as fever, malaise and weight loss may precede overt joint
symptoms.
RA may be associated with other connective tissue diseases and chronic
non inflammatory pain e.g. fibromyalgia. It is also an independent risk
factor for cardiovascular (CV) diseases and osteoporosis.
The key presenting symptoms of joint inflammation are:
• joint pain and swelling
• early morning stiffness lasting ≥30 minutes
The typical articular pattern of RA is symmetrical polyarthritis affecting:
• metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints
• proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints
• interphalangeal joint of thumbs
• wrists
• elbows
• metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints
The symptoms of joint inflammation should be present for at least six
weeks.
Findings on physical examination include:
• clinical synovitis
 joint tenderness
 boggy swelling (may be subtle in early RA)
• restricted range of motion
• joint deformities e.g. radial deviation of the wrist, ulnar deviation
at the MCPs, “swan-neck” [flexion of distal interphalangeal (DIP)
joint, hyperextension of PIP] and “boutonniere” (hyperextension of
DIP, flexion of PIP) deformities
Differential diagnosis of polyarthritis should take into consideration:
• duration of symptoms
• pattern of joint involvement
• presence of systemic features and/or other diseases
Important differentials include:
• psoriatic arthritis
• erosive inflammatory osteoarthritis
• polyarticular gout
• arthritis related to infection
• systemic lupus erythematosus
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
•
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of RA are mandatory to
prevent irreversible joint damage.
Recommendation 1
•
Consider rheumatoid arthritis if inflammation involving multiple joints
is present for at least six weeks.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
3. INVESTIGATIONS
Laboratory and imaging investigations are performed to assist in
diagnosis, screen pre-existing abnormalities and co-morbidities, as well
as to monitor treatment-related adverse events (AEs).
3.1 Laboratory Test
Relevant laboratory tests in RA are shown in table below.
Table 1. Laboratory Investigations in RA
*ACPA is interchangeable with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)
RF and ACPA have similar diagnostic sensitivity (67% and 79%
respectively)1 although ACPA has a higher specificity compared with
RF (95 - 98% and 79 - 85% respectively).1-2 Presence of both RF and
ACPA indicate a more severe disease. ACPA should be considered in
clinically suspected RA where RF is negative. Both RF and ACPA are
not recommended for disease monitoring.
Phase of
management
Investigations
• Inflammatory markers
o Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or
o C-reactive protein (CRP)
• Rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or
• Anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)*
• Full blood count (FBC)
• Renal profile (RP)
• Fasting blood sugar
• Fasting lipid profile
• Liver function test (LFT)
• Viral hepatitis screening [hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody]
• Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if risk factor
present
• FBC
• RP
• LFT
• ESR and CRP
• Hepatitis B core antibody, if HBsAg negative
• Mantoux ± Interferon Gamma Release Assay
(IGRA)
• HIV screening
• Immunoglobulin (Ig) G, A and M [prior to rituximab
(RTX)]

•
Positive RF does not equate to RA as it is present in normal
population with a higher incidence in the elderly.
•
Negative RF does not exclude RA as 30 - 40% of patients with RA
are seronegative.3-4
Recommendation 2
•
Inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor ± anti-citrullinated
peptide antibody should be tested when there is clinical suspicion of
rheumatoid arthritis.
3.2 Imaging
3.2.1 Plain Radiography
a. Chest X-Ray
Chest X-ray is performed at baseline evaluation and repeated on
follow-up for assessment of disease complications and co-morbidities.
It is also mandatory as part of pre-biologic tuberculosis screening (refer
to Appendix 8).
b. Hand X-Ray
Plain radiograph is the most common modality used to assess
the joints. It may be normal within the first six months of RA onset.
The radiograph findings include soft-tissue swelling, juxta-articular
demineralisation, joint space narrowing and bone erosions. These
changes are symmetrical and spare the distal IP joints. Refer to
Figure 1 and 2.

deformity, (C) boutonniere deformity, (D) subchondral cyst, (E) sclerosis
and joint space narrowing at MCP joints. Similar abnormalities seen in
PIP, radiocarpal and intercarpal joints.
3.2.2 Musculoskeletal Ultrasound
Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a useful bedside tool that is increasingly
being used by rheumatologists to aid early diagnosis and management
of RA. Ultrasound is more accurate than clinical assessment in early RA
patients especially those with negative ACPA:
•
Clinical synovitis (tender or swollen joint) vs subclinical synovitis
(ultrasound detected):5, level II-2
 Gray Scale (GS) ≥1: sensitivity 58.8% vs 78.0%, specificity
79.4% vs 79.4%
 GS ≥1/Power Doppler (PD) ≥1: sensitivity 58.5% vs 56.2%,
specificity 79.4% vs 93.7%

Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
•
In patients with negative ACPA, combining ultrasound detected
synovitis joint counts with 2010 ACR/EULAR classification
criteria increased diagnostic sensitivity from 55.2% to 72.4% and
specificity from 78.5% to 87.7%.6, level II-2
Presence of ultrasound detected synovitis increases the prevalence
of clinical synovitis. This may classify patients with musculoskeletal
symptoms more accurately.5-7, level II-2
•
Ultrasound of the joints is useful in detecting subclinical synovitis for
suspected inflammatory arthritis including RA.
3.2.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another imaging modality to
detect synovitis in hands and wrists in early RA which may not be
clinically evident:
•
In a systematic review, MRI hand and wrist had good accuracy in
the diagnosis of RA in patients with <6 months disease duration
(AUC=0.81).8, level l
•
MRI synovitis in PIP joint is a strong predictor of early RA without
typical symptoms (OR=3.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.1).9, level II-2
MRI can detect synovitis, bone erosions and bone marrow oedema
better than conventional radiography but its use is limited due to cost
and availability.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
4. CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA
RA should be suspected in patients who present with inflammatory
polyarthritis. Initial evaluation of such patients requires a careful history,
physical examination and selected laboratory tests to identify features
that are characteristic of RA. Patients are classified as having RA based
on the criteria established by American College of Rheumatology/
European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2010 (refer to
Table 2). This classification criteria supersedes the older ACR 1987
revised criteria.
Table 2. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European
League Against Rheumatism Classification Criteria
for Rheumatoid Arthritis

Scores
Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who
1) have at least 1 joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling)*
2) with the synovitis not better explained by another disease
Classification criteria for RA (score-based algorithm: add score of
categories A - D; a score of ≥6/10 is needed for classification of a
patient as having definite RA)
A. Joint involvement
1 large joint
2 - 10 large joints
1 - 3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)
4 - 10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)
>10 joints (at least 1 small joint)
B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for
classification)
Negative RF and negative ACPA
Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA
High-positive RF or high-positive ACPA
C. Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for
classification)

A score of ≥6 is classified as having definite RA
A score of <6 may fulfil the criteria over time
There are four domains in the classification criteria:
A. Joint involvement (swollen or tender joint on examination, which
may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis)
Large joints refer to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees and ankles.
Small joints refer to MCPs, PIPs, second through fifth MTPs,
thumb IPs and wrists.
*DIP joints, first carpometacarpal joints and first MTP joints are
excluded from assessment.
B. Serology
High positive refers to International Unit values >3 times upper
limit normal.
C. Acute-phase reactants
Normal or abnormal is determined by local laboratory standards.
D. Duration
Patient self-report on the duration of signs or symptoms of
synovitis.
5. PROGNOSTIC FACTORS
RA outcome is influenced by many factors and awareness of these
factors can guide the healthcare providers on early referral for initiation
of treatment.
Poor prognostic factors in RA are:
•
older age (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.94)10, level II-2
•
female (OR=3.36, 95% CI 1.20 to 9.40)11, level II-2
•
obesity (OR=5.2, 95% CI 1.8 to 15.2)12, level I
•
smoking (OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.45)13, level I
•
presence of ACPA/anti-CCP (OR ranging from 1.01 to 4.22)11, level II-2;
14, level I; 15-16, level II-2; 17, level III
•
presence of RF (OR ranging from 2.483 to 3.64)10-11, level II-2; 18, level III
•
high CRP (OR ranging from 1.04 to 1.52)13, level I; 19, level II-2

6. REFERRAL
All RA patients should be primarily managed by rheumatologists. This
is due to the complexity of making a definite diagnosis and ensuring
adequate treatment of the disease.
Indications for referral are as listed below:21-22
a. Referral for diagnosis
1. Clinical suspicion of RA supported by the presence of any of the
following:
•
more than three swollen joints
•
MCP/MTP joint involvement with positive squeeze test (refer
to Figure 3)
•
early morning stiffness of more than 30 minutes
2. Clinical evidence of persistent synovitis of undetermined cause
Figure 3. Positive Squeeze Test
b. Referral following diagnosis
1. Development of a co-management plan
2. Optimisation of therapy in active disease
3. Disease-related complications (e.g. acute flare or interstitial lung
disease) or treatment-related complications (e.g. infection or
transaminitis)
c. Referral of patients with special considerations
1. Pre-pregnancy care, pregnancy and lactation
2. History of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C
3. History of malignancy
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
•
Referral of RA cases to rheumatology clinic should provide the
following information:
 Symptoms and signs: duration, joint distribution, severity and
impact on activity of daily living
 Extra-articular involvement
 Co-morbidities that may require further medical assessment
 Current medications
 Relevant investigation results
Recommendation 3
•
All patients suspected of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should be
referred to the rheumatologist.
•
All RA patients should be primarily managed by rheumatologists.
 Co-management plan with primary healthcare providers may be
offered subsequently.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
7. TREATMENT
Optimal care of patients with RA consists of an integrated approach that
includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments
(refer to Algorithm 2). Pharmacological treatment should be initiated
as soon as RA diagnosis is made to preserve joint function and QoL.
Successful treatment in RA is determined using outcome measures.
Although they were originally used in the field of research, the
development of effective RA treatment had promoted their use
in clinical practice. There are many validated outcome measures
reflecting various RA manifestations such as the underlying disease
process, level of discomfort and disability, and organ damage (refer to
Appendix 3). The use of these outcome measures allows standardised
objective assessments of RA disease activity, which in turn drives
treatment decisions.
•
Treatment goals in RA include:
 pain relief and control of inflammation
 preservation of joint function and QoL
 minimising systemic complications and managing co-morbidities
•
Treat-to-target (T2T) treatment strategy, formulated in 2010, has
resulted in better disease outcomes. It includes:23
 a defined treatment target (clinical remission or at least low
disease activity)
 shared decision making
 assessment of disease activity
 regular adjustment of treatment
Recommendation 4
•
Aim to achieve a state of clinical remission or at least low disease
activity within six months using a treat-to-target treatment strategy*
in rheumatoid arthritis.
*Refer to preceding yellow box
7.1 Non-Pharmacological Treatment
7.1.1 Patient Education
Patient education is an important non-pharmacological component in
the management of RA. It should include information on the diagnosis,
nature of the disease including its complications, benefits and risks of
therapeutic options. This may improve patient’s understanding and
compliance to treatment (refer to Appendix 4 on Patient Education
Leaflet).

7.1.2 Occupational Therapy
Patients with RA may benefit from occupational therapy. Joint protection
with hand strengthening and mobilisation exercise is adapted to the
disease stage, patient and environment.
Joint protection advice with hand strengthening and mobilisation
exercises improve Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS) of
the upper limb function compared with joint protection and hand
mobilisation exercises, and joint protection advice alone, in RA at six
months (p=0.012).24, level I
Most of the advice on joint protection deals with manual activities. They
are effective in reducing morning stiffness, pain and functional capacity.
These include:
•
movement training to facilitate daily activities
•
self-exercise programme for hands
•
provision of information on assistive devices and handling of
orthoses
Refer to Appendix 5 on Joint Protection Principles.
Figure 4 illustrates the various steps for hand strengthening exercise.
Figure 4. Hand strengthening exercise.
Arrows illustrate the directions of the hand movement. (A) The hand is
squeezing the putty. (B) The putty is moved between the wrist proper
and the fingertips. (C) The wrist proper is placed in the putty, and then
the MCP joints are stretched in the putty. (D) The thumb and fingers are
shaping the putty. The fingertips are bent during the motion.
7.1.3 Physiotherapy
Physiotherapy may offer beneficial modalities to help RA patients
in reducing pain. These include Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve
Stimulation (TENS) therapy and aerobic activities.
TENS therapy reduces pain at rest compared with placebo in RA (WMD
in VAS 100 mm= -59.50, 95% CI -76.58 to -42.42).25, level I
When RA is active, aerobic activities with low impact on the joints or
with load alleviation is preferred. Aerobic activity, dynamic muscular
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
reinforcement and patient education are valuable in the nonpharmacological management of RA.26
7.1.4 Podiatry
Every patient with RA should be advised on proper footwear. Customised
orthotic insoles are recommended for patients with foot pain from weightbearing and deformities as they may reduce pain on walking and improve
functional capacity. Custom manufactured rigid foot orthoses under
podiatry supervision has been shown to be more effective compared with
foot orthoses prescribed under normal medical care.27, level I
7.1.5 Dietetics
At present, there is no strong evidence that dietary interventions help in
reducing disease activity in RA.
Recommendation 5
•
Patient education should be included in the management of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
•
Joint protection advice with hand strengthening and mobilisation
exercises should be offered in RA.
7.2 Pharmacological Treatment
Pharmacological treatment should be initiated as soon as RA
diagnosis is made. It consists of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), corticosteroids and DMARDs. NSAIDs are generally used
for symptomatic treatment on a short-term and/or ‘as needed basis’,
to reduce pain, joint stiffness and inflammation, as well as to improve
diminished joint function. On the other hand, DMARDs are a group of
drugs targeted to the underlying aetiology of RA, used on a longer term to
suppress an overactive immune system that causes joint and systemic
inflammation. Hence, DMARDs delay disease progression, preserve
joint integrity and minimise systemic complications. Corticosteroids
serve as a bridging therapy while awaiting the initiation and/or effect of
DMARDs. It can also be used as short-term therapy for acute RA flare.
Refer Appendix 6 on Pharmacological Treatment of RA.
7.2.1 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
NSAIDs are used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation in RA. There
is no evidence to suggest NSAIDs alter the course of the disease.
Although there are a variety of preparations, topical and oral forms
are the most widely used. This category of medication encompasses
traditional NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and naproxen)
and the cycloooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2) inhibitors - selective and
specific (e.g. meloxicam, etoricoxib and celecoxib). Important sideeffects involve the gastrointestinal, renal and CV systems.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
A randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed the use of ketoprofen patch
for two weeks was more effective than placebo in relieving local pain
[mean percentage change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score (%) ±
SD: 31.2±30.3, 95% CI 28.0 to 34.4] and as safe (overall incidence and
laboratory AEs) as placebo in RA. The most common AE was contact
dermatitis.28, level I
In another RCT, naproxen 500 mg twice daily was more effective than
placebo:29, level I
•

 ACR20 responder criteria (MD=1.15, 95% CI -7.74 to 10.03)
A Cochrane review involving eight RCTs concluded that celecoxib 200
mg daily was more effective than placebo in RA:30, level I
•
ACR20 improvement (RR=1.53, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.86)
•
alleviation of pain (VAS) (NNT= 4, 95% CI 3 to 6)
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
•
improvement in physical function (HAQ) (3.3% absolute
improvement, 95% CI 9.6% better to 3.3% worse)
In assessment of ACR20, alleviation of pain (VAS) and HAQ, celecoxib
200 mg daily was as effective as naproxen 1000 mg daily, diclofenac
150 mg daily and meloxicam 15 mg daily.30, level I
Etoricoxib 90 mg daily has better gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability than
diclofenac 75 mg twice daily for up to 24 months:31, level I
•
abdominal pain and gastritis (HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93)
•
changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) (HR=0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.48)
However, it has significantly more renovascular AEs (oedema and
hypertension). There is no difference in cardiac AEs and renal
dysfunction.31-32, level I
Celecoxib 200 mg daily is as safe as placebo in the incidence of
gastroduodenal ulcers ≥3 mm but safer compared with traditional
NSAIDs (NNH=9, 95% CI 8 to 10). There is no conclusive evidence
that celecoxib has more CV events than traditional NSAIDs.30, level I
A Cochrane systematic review concluded that there are no studies
to guide clinicians on the best choice of pharmacotherapy for pain
management in RA patients with CV and renal co-morbidities.33, level I
•
NSAIDs are more effective than placebo in reducing pain and
improving function of patients with RA. However, concerns of
gastrointestinal, renal and CV adverse effects limit their use in the
general population.
•
NSAIDs do not have disease modifying property in the treatment of
RA.
•
Use NSAIDs judiciously (at the lowest effective dose and for the
shortest duration possible) in RA patients especially those with comorbidities.
Recommendation 6
•
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used as an adjunct
therapy to reduce pain and inflammation in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis treated with Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs.
7.2.2 Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids such as cortisone, hydrocortisone and prednisolone
are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Prednisolone
is preferred over other long-acting corticosteroids (betamethasone,
dexamethasone) in the treatment of RA since it causes less inhibition of
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Long-term use of corticosteroids
predisposes to several complications, in particular osteoporosis and
infection (refer to Appendix 6). Hence, patients on corticosteroids
should be supplemented with calcium and vitamin D, and have regular
surveillance for infection.
In a large, multicentre RCT, inclusion of low-dose prednisolone (10 mg
daily) in a methotrexate (MTX)-based treatment strategy for tight control
in early RA significantly improved erosion score at two years compared
with MTX-placebo. It also improved Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28)
at three and six months. The time to first sustained remission was
shorter by five months (p=0.001).34, level I
In a Cochrane systematic review of moderate quality primary
papers, addition of a low-dose prednisolone (≤10 mg) or step-down
corticosteroids regime to DMARDs was effective compared with
placebo or active control, in early active RA at one year:35, level I
•
erosion (SMD= -0.39, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.26)
•
joint space narrowing (SMD= -0.27, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.04)
In terms of safety profile, there was no significant difference in adverse
effects between MTX-prednisolone and MTX-placebo treatment
strategies.34, level I However, two cohort studies showed corticosteroid
therapy was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and
cerebrovascular accidents in RA.36 - 37, level II-2
•
Corticosteroids can be used as an add-on therapy to conventional
synthetic or biologic DMARDs.
Recommendation 7
•
Short-term* low-dose corticosteroids** may be used in active
rheumatoid arthritis.
*short-term refers to <3 months
**if oral prednisolone is used, the dose should be ≤10 mg once daily
7.2.3 Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs
Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) are used as soon
as RA is diagnosed to retard disease progression. Treatment options
include:
•
conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)
•
targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs)
•
biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)
•
biosimilar DMARDs (bsDMARDs)
The treatment options are guided by disease severity, presence of comorbidities, patient’s compliance and physician’s experience.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
a. Conventional Synthetic DMARDs
The four commonly used csDMARDs are MTX, sulfasalazine (SSZ),
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and leflunomide (LEF). They may be used
as monotherapy or in combination to achieve treatment target. In
general, csDMARDs may take up to eight weeks to exert their effects
hence the need for bridging therapy with corticosteroids.
i. Methotrexate
MTX is the mainstay treatment of RA. In a Cochrane systematic review,
patients on MTX monotherapy were more likely to achieve ACR50 at one
year compared with placebo. The improvement of parameters included
number of tender and swollen joints, and inflammatory markers:38, level I
•
improvement of ACR50 (RR=3.03, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.98)
•
reduction of tender joint count (TJC) (RR= -0.64, 95% CI -0.88 to
-0.41) and swollen joint count (SJC) (RR= -0.73, 95% CI -0.97 to
-0.49)
•
reduction of inflammatory markers at 52 weeks; ESR (RR=
-12.60, 95% CI -18.97 to -6.23) and CRP (RR= -1.56, 95%
CI -2.11 to -1.01)
In another Cochrane systematic review on different groups of
populations receiving MTX:39, level I
•
MTX-naïve patients - MTX monotherapy was as effective as MTX
combination therapy with other non-biologic DMARDs
 improvement in ACR50 (RR=1.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 4.85)
•
MTX-inadequate response patients - combination MTX with nonbiologic DMARDs was more effective than MTX monotherapy
 improvement of ACR50 (RR=4.54, 95% CI 2.51 to 8.20)
 reduction of TJC (SMD= -0.51, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.33) and
SJC (SMD= -0.45, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.27)
 reduction of CRP (SMD= -12.1, 95% CI -19.84 to -4.36)
•
Non-MTX DMARDs inadequate response patients - MTX
combination therapy was as effective as MTX monotherapy
in improvement of ACR50, but was more effective than MTX
monotherapy in reduction of TJC and SJC
 improvement of ACR50 (RR=1.68, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.99)
 reduction of TJC (WMD= -4, 95% CI -6.82 to -1.18) and SJC
(SMD= -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17)
Significant AEs experienced by patients on MTX were infection
(commonly upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and pneumonia),
liver enzyme abnormalities, stomatitis, oral ulcers, alopecia and
gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.
Patients on MTX were less likely to discontinue medication compared
with placebo (RR=0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.88). The main reason for
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
discontinuation in the MTX group was due to liver enzyme abnormalities
(RR=3.75, 95% CI 1.59 to 8.84).38, level I
Combination therapy of MTX with other non-biologic DMARDs had
significantly more GI AEs [MTX+SSZ (RR=1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to
2.67); MTX+LEF (RR=1.67, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.40)] and abnormal LFT
[MTX+LEF (RR=4.30, 95% CI 2.58 to 7.15)].39, level I
•
Subcutaneous (SC)/intramuscular (IM) MTX can be used in patients
intolerant to MTX.
•
Folic acid (minimum 5 mg/week) should be given to prevent MTXrelated AEs.
•
MTX is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. It should be
stopped for at least three months in women prior to conception.
Recommendation 8
•
Methotrexate should be used as the first-line Disease Modifying
Anti-Rheumatic Drug in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis unless
contraindicated.
ii. Sulfasalazine
In a Cochrane systematic review, SSZ was more effective compared
with placebo for the following outcome measures:40, level I
•
tender joint (SMD= -0.49, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.36)
•
swollen joints (SMD= -0.49, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.12)
•
pain (SMD= -0.42, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.12)
•
ESR (WMD= -17.6 mm, 95% CI -21.93 to -13.23)
Patients on SSZ were significantly less likely to withdraw from
treatment due to lack of efficacy (OR=0.23, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.37).
However, adverse reactions requiring withdrawal of therapy were three
times more frequent in the treatment group, with gastrointestinal and
mucocutaneous symptoms being the most frequent.40, level I
iii. Hydroxychloroquine
A Cochrane systematic review showed that HCQ was more effective
than placebo in improving clinical outcomes i.e:41, level I
•
tender joints (SMD= -0.33, CI -0.50 to -0.17)
•
swollen joints (SMD= -0.52, CI -0.69 to -0.36)
•
pain (SMD= -0.45, CI -0.50 to -0.17)
In terms of safety profile, there were no significant withdrawals in
HCQ group compared with placebo due to adverse reaction. None
of the studies which conducted ophthalmologic evaluations reported
withdrawals due to ocular toxicity.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
•
All patients on HCQ should have a baseline eye examination and
ophthalmological review while they are on treatment.
iv. Leflunomide
In a meta-analysis on RA of moderate quality primary papers, LEF
monotherapy was:42, level I
•
more effective than placebo in
 ACR50 at one year (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.96)
 total reduction in TJC (WMD= -5.02, 95% CI -6.41 to -3.64)
and SJC (WMD= -3.21, 95% CI -4.32 to -2.09)
 ESR (WMD= -9.22, 95% CI -12.37 to -6.07)
•
as effective as MTX monotherapy at one year in total reduction
of TJC, SJC and ESR except for ACR50 where LEF was more
effective (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.96)
•
as effective as SSZ monotherapy at one year in improvement of
ACR50 and total reduction of TJC, SJC and ESR; however, it was
more effective in ACR50 after two years of treatment (RR=2.10,
95% CI 1.25 to 3.53)
LEF was significantly associated with alopecia, elevation of liver
enzymes, diarrhoea and allergic reactions compared with placebo.
More patients on LEF monotherapy experienced pruritus, hypertension,
diarrhoea and alopecia compared with MTX, while less patients on
LEF experienced mouth ulceration and liver enzyme elevation (more
than three times upper limit normal). When compared with SSZ, more
patients on LEF experienced diarrhoea.42, level I
b. Targeted Synthetic DMARDs
i. Tofacitinib
In a meta-analysis, tofacitinib 5 mg BD was more effective in ACR50
compared with placebo and adalimumab at 12 weeks in MTX-resistant
RA:43, level I
•
placebo: RR=2.91, 95% CI 2.03 to 4.16
•
adalimumab: RR=1.95, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.80
In an RCT, tofacitinib 5 mg BD monotherapy was more effective in
ACR50 than MTX in early (<1 year) compared with established RA at
24 months (p<0.001 vs p<0.05).44, level I
No difference in safety profile was observed between patients on
tofacitinib and placebo.43, level I
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
ii. Baricitinib
Two RCTs reported that baricitinib 4 mg was effective in treating RA
compared to placebo in patients with:
•
insufficient response or intolerance to one or more conventional
synthetic DMARDs45, level I
•
inadequate response to or experience unacceptable side effects
associated with one or more tumour necrosis factor inhibitors,
other biologic DMARDs or both46, level I
No difference in safety profile was observed between patients on
baricitinib and placebo.45 - 46, level I
c. Biologics
bDMARDs are agents designed to specifically target immune cells
involved in the pathogenesis of RA. There are a number of bDMARDs
that have been shown to be effective and safe. bDMARDs are
considered when the treatment target is not achieved with csDMARDs
and in the presence of poor prognostic factors. Early introduction of
bDMARDs has been shown to retard the development of clinically
relevant radiographic progression.19, level II-2
bDMARDs currently available and approved in Malaysia for RA are:
•
Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF): infliximab (IFX),
etanercept (ETN), adalimumab (ADA) and golimumab (GOL)
•
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blocker: tocilizumab (TCZ)
•
Anti-B cell agent: RTX
The use of bDMARDs for the treatment of RA has increased the risk of
tuberculosis (TB) reactivation especially in patients treated with antiTNF.47, level I Thus, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or
active TB infection must be done prior to starting bDMARDs (refer to
Table 1 and Appendix 8). Mantoux test is the main screening test
but where available, IGRA may be considered as an alternative or
complementary screening test.
i. Infliximab
A meta-analysis showed that IFX at doses of 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg
in combination with MTX had better ACR50 in the following
comparisons:48, level I
•
vs MTX monotherapy or combined DMARDs
 at 20 weeks (RR=2.45, 95% CI 1.73 to 3.48)
 at 52 weeks (RR=1.47, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.74)
•
vs DMARDs in early RA (RR=1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.14)
•
vs DMARDs in established or late RA (RR=2.11, 95% CI 1.48 to
3.01)
•
vs DMARDs in patients who were MTX-naïve (RR=1.44, 95% CI
1.18 to 1.76)
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
•
vs DMARDs in patients who failed or had insufficient response to
MTX (RR=2.13, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.97)
The combination of IFX+MTX favoured clinical remission (RR=1.92,
95% CI 1.35 to 2.74) and showed lower radiographic progression [MD
for total Sharp score (TSS)= -2.57, 95% CI -3.64 to -1.49] (in particular
those who had insufficient response to MTX or MTX-naïve) compared
with DMARDs.48, level I
There was no significant difference in AEs of infection, serious infection,
serious adverse event, tumour and death between groups. However,
infusion reactions occurred more frequently in IFX+MTX group.48, level I
ii. Etanercept
Results from a Cochrane systematic review showed that SC etanercept
(ETN) 25 mg twice weekly in combination with DMARD (MTX or
SSZ) was more effective than DMARD monotherapy (MTX or SSZ)
in reducing disease activity and disability as well as delaying joint
radiographic progression:49, level I
•
ETN+DMARD vs DMARD
 ACR50 at 12 months (RR=1.52, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.70)
 remission at 12 months (RR=1.95, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.35)
 improvement in HAQ score at six months (MD in HAQ
score= -0.49, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.21)
 delay in radiographic progression, regardless of response to
treatment, at three years (MD for TSS= -6.09, 95% CI -9.22 to
-2.96)
•
ETN+DMARD vs ETN
 ACR50 at 12 months (RR=1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.69)
 remission at 12 months (RR=2.18, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.03)
 delay in radiographic progression, regardless of response to
treatment, at three years (MD for TSS= -1.75, 95% CI -3.27 to
-0.23)
These findings are supported by another meta-analysis which
analysed ETN as monotherapy or combination but with a longer
follow-up:50, level I
•
ETN ± combination vs MTX
 ACR50 at one to three years (RR=1.37, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.53)
•
ETN vs MTX
 delay in radiographic progression at three years (MD in TSS=
-4.34, 95% CI -7.56 to -1.12)
In terms of safety profile, there was no statistical difference in infection
rate between ETN+DMARD vs DMARD monotherapy.49, level I
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
iii. Adalimumab
A systematic review showed that SC ADA 40 mg every two weeks
either as monotherapy or in combination with DMARD (mainly MTX)

Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
v. Tocilizumab
Results from four meta-analyses and two RCTs showed that intravenous
(IV) TCZ as monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs was more
effective than MTX and combination DMARDs in improving clinical and
functional outcomes in RA:
•
TCZ monotherapy 8 mg/kg vs MTX
 ACR50: 44% vs 34% (p=0.002)55, level I
 DAS28-ESR remission at 24 weeks: RR=3.70, 95% CI 2.47 to
5.5556, level I
 sustained remission (DAS28 <2.6, swollen joint count ≤4,
persisting for at least 24 weeks): RR=1.86, 95% CI 1.48 to
2.3257, level I
 radiographic progression at 104 weeks: 1.45 vs 1.53
(p=0.0381)57, level I
•

- 1.18 vs 1.53 (p=0.0207)57, level I
- 0.37 vs 1.96 (p<0.0001)60, level I
In patients with inadequate response to anti-TNF, TCZ+MTX was
shown to be more effective than MTX monotherapy (28.8% vs 3.8%,
p<0.0001).55, level I; 58, level I
An RCT showed that SC and IV TCZ were comparable in ACR50,
DAS28, HAQ DI and safety.61, level I
TCZ in combination with MTX as compared with placebo or DMARD
is associated with a slight increased risk of AEs [OR=1.53 (95%
CI 1.26 to 1.86)] and infection [OR=1.30 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.58)]. No
increased incidence of malignancy, TB reactivation or hepatitis has
been observed.62, level I
vi. Rituximab
A Cochrane systematic review showed that IV RTX (given two weeks
apart) in combination with MTX was more effective in improving
clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes compared with MTX
monotherapy at 24 weeks:63, level I
•
RTX (1000 mg at D1 and D15)+MTX vs MTX
 ACR50: RR=3.25, 95% CI 2.31 to 4.58
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
 HAQ-DI minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of
-0.22: RR=1.61, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.12
 no radiographic progression: RR=1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.35
•
RTX (500 mg at D1 and D15)+MTX vs MTX
 ACR50: RR=2.69, 95% CI 1.85 to 3.90
 HAQ-DI MCID of -0.22: RR=1.58, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.11
 no radiographic progression: RR=1.33, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.64
A greater proportion of patients receiving RTX (1000 mg x 2 doses)
in combination with MTX developed infusion reaction after the first
infusion compared with those receiving MTX monotherapy and
placebo infusions (RR=1.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9). However, no significant
differences were noted in the rates of SAEs.63, level I
d. Biosimilars
Biosimilars are products which are highly similar to the reference
biologics and have no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy
and safety. A recent systematic review demonstrated comparable
effectiveness and safety outcomes between the pivotal trials of
originators (IFX, ADA and ETN) and their respective biosimilars in
DMARDs-experienced RA patients.64, level I
i. Biosimilar Infliximab
CT-P13 (Remsima) infusion in combination with MTX is effective, well
tolerated and highly comparable with reference IFX.65, level I Results from
a meta-analysis also showed no significant differences between the
efficacy of IFX-biosimilar and other biologics.66, level I
ii. Biosimilar Adalimumab
Biosimilar adalimumab is also effective, well tolerated and highly
comparable with reference ADA in DMARDs-naïve patients.67, level I
•
bMARDs and tsDMARDs are effective in both early-onset and
established RA.
Recommendation 9
•
Biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (bDMARDs) and
targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) should be considered
when the treatment target is not achieved with conventional synthetic
DMARDs. Where available, biosimilar DMARDs (bsDMARDs) may
be considered as effective alternatives.
•
All patients should be screened for tuberculosis, hepatitis B and
C, and human immunodeficiency virus prior to treatment with
bDMARDs, bsDMARDs or tsDMARDs.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
8. TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINES
Traditional and complementary medicines (TCM) is often part of the
cultural practice in Malaysian society in maintaining health. The intake
of nutritional supplements as well as Chinese herbal medicine and
Ayurvedic therapies are common practices among patients with RA.
•
There is insufficient evidence on safety and efficacy of TCM to
support its use in the treatment of RA.
9. RHEUMATOLOGY NURSE-LED CARE
The escalating demand for rheumatology care has extended the role
of nurses in addressing unmet management needs of patients with RA.
In some countries, rheumatology nurse-led care was established to
enhance follow-up care for patients with RA, which includes monitoring
of laboratory results, assessment of disease activity, patient education
and psychosocial support.
The effectiveness of nurse-led care in rheumatology was reported in three
systematic reviews. Short-term (12 - 24 months) rheumatology nurseled care was as effective as medical-care involving rheumatologists,
physicians and general practitioners in the management of RA (DAS28,
HAQ, pain and fatigue scores).68, level I There was no significant difference
in RA disease activity at one to two years follow-up between nurse-led
care and care by rheumatologists and junior hospital doctors.69 - 70, level I
Nurse-led care was safe in the management of patients with RA when
compared with medical care involving rheumatologists, physicians and
general practitioners. The outcome measures were out of range blood
test, monitoring adherence, healthcare contacts, hospitalisations and
death.68, level I

10. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Co-morbidity
10.1.1
Infection
All DMARDs should be discontinued in the presence of serious infection
but can be recommenced once the infection has resolved.71
10.1.2
Elective Surgery
csDMARDs may be continued throughout the perioperative period in
patients undergoing elective joint replacement surgery. tsDMARDs and
bDMARDs should be withheld close to one dosing cycle prior to elective
surgery and restarted after evidence of wound healing, typically 14
days, in the absence of infection (refer to Table 3).72

safety data. Refer to Appendix 6.
Pre-conception counselling includes disease course and medication
safety during pregnancy and lactation. These must be addressed in
women with RA and men who wish to father a child to ensure favourable
pregnancy outcomes.
10.3 Vaccination
Vaccinations are important in the management of RA since the patients
are at higher risk of infections compared with general population. This
is due to the underlying autoimmune disease and immunosuppressive
therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and DMARDs). The 2015 ACR
recommendations regarding the use of vaccines in patients with RA are
outlined in Table 4.

vaccines in RA on DMARDs or biologic agents.

Killed and conjugate vaccines are safe and may be considered in
RA patients.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
11. MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP
Many drugs used in the treatment of RA have potential side-effects
and may aggravate co-morbidities associated with the underlying
disease. Combination of DMARDs are often needed to control disease
activity and this may pose a greater risk for AEs. Hence, an integral
part in the management of RA include the healthcare provider’s
understanding of the safety profiles of each therapy and vigilance in
monitoring for potential harms to patients. Nurse- and/or pharmacy-led
patient counselling on the importance of routine laboratory tests and
recognition of adverse symptoms may enable early detection of drug
toxicity and appropriate action to be taken to minimise harm.
An overview of laboratory abnormalities of each drug and a summary of
current guidelines for laboratory monitoring as well as recommendation
on frequency of monitoring is provided in the Appendix 7.
12. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
Implementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality
healthcare services based on the best and most recent available
evidence applied to local scenario. Various factors and resource
implications should be considered for the success of the uptake in the
CPG recommendations.
12.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors
The facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:
1. availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and
softcopies)
2. conferences and updates on management of RA including
those involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian Society of
Rheumatology)
3. Key Performance Indicator on Rheumatology Services monitored
by MoH (i.e. screening for viral hepatitis on RA patients prior to
starting MTX)
4. related registries - Malaysian NIAR (myNIAR) and Malaysian
Rheumatology Biologics Registry (MARBLE)
5. public awareness during World Arthritis Day
Limiting factors in the CPG implementation include:
1. limited awareness and knowledge in management of RA among
healthcare providers
2. insufficient resources in RA care e.g. expertise, diagnostic tests
and medications
3. poor access to rheumatology services
4. misconception on the disease and its management by the public

12.2 Potential Resource Implications
To implement the CPG, there must be strong commitments to:
1. ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers
via printed copies and online accessibility
2. reinforce training of healthcare providers via regular seminars
and workshops
3. involve multidisciplinary team at all levels of health care
4. improve the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities
5. train more experts and develop rheumatology nurse-led care in
the field of RA
6. strengthen related national registries on RA
To assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed
as clinical audit indicators for quality management:
*Target of 70%
**Unless contraindicated; Target of 80%
Implementation strategies will be developed following the approval of
the CPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module.

Measurement of functional status and quality of life
A self-administered questionnaire to assess functional
status in adults with arthritis. It evaluates patient difficulty
with activities of daily living over the past week; it covers
eight categories including dressing and grooming, arising,
eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and, errands
and chores, as well as the use of specific aids or devices
and the need for assistance from another person
A 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health, used
to measure health status and QoL
A scoring system used to quantify the radiological changes
in patients with RA; the system describes 16 areas of

APPENDIX 4
PATIENT EDUCATION LEAFLET
A. Disease Information
I. How does RA affect the joints?
• RA causes inflammation in the joints. This leads to pain and
stiffness in the morning, lasting more than 30 minutes. Other
symptoms include redness, warmth and swelling at the joint.
• RA affects joints by causing inflammation at the synovium
(refer Figure 5). If untreated, the inflammation may damage
cartilage and bone.
• The commonly affected joints are the small joints of the hands
and feet but other joints like shoulders, elbows, knees and
ankles may also be affected.
• In some people, RA may also affect other parts of the body
including the eyes, lungs and blood vessels. Other associated
symptoms include fatigue and mild fever.
II. Causes
• RA is caused by a problem in the immune system, unlike
osteoarthritis which is usually caused by ‘wear and tear’.
• The exact cause of RA is still unclear but certain factors are
thought to increase the risk of developing it:
 environment - e.g. infection
 genes - the chance of developing RA is partly genetic
 hormones - women are more likely to have RA
 lifestyle - smoking cigarettes can double the risk of
developing RA
III. Diagnosis
• There is no single test to diagnose RA. The diagnosis is made
based on symptoms, physical examination, x-rays and/or
ultrasound and blood tests.

B. Medication
There is no cure for RA but treatment is available to control joint pain,
minimise joint damage and ultimately, improve physical function and
QoL. Types of medications commonly prescribed:
• NSAIDs to relieve joint pain and swelling
• DMARDs to treat joint inflammation and slow the disease process;
used long-term
• corticosteroids to treat joint inflammation; used short-term
• biologics and targeted DMARDs when DMARDs are not effective
or not tolerated
Treatment is individualised and not all medications work for everyone.
Hence, it is important to discuss treatment options and inform your
doctor if there are any issues with the prescribed medications. Your
doctor will monitor for any possible side effects from medications and
adjust treatment as needed. It is important to adhere to your clinic
appointments and treatment for optimal management of your RA.
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
C. Lifestyle Modification
Lifestyle modification is also important to improve RA symptoms and
QoL. By staying active, eating well and limiting stress, overall health
can be optimised.
I. Physical activity
• It is best to rest the joint when it is acutely inflamed (painful
and swollen).
• Regular, gentle exercises can be done once inflammation
has resolved. This will improve joint flexibility and general
well-being. They include:
 low impact aerobic exercises e.g. line dancing, wateraerobic
 strengthening exercises e.g. walking, swimming, stationary
cycling
 stretching and range-of-motion exercises e.g. tai chi, yoga
II. Daily tasks
You may need to make some adaptations to your daily tasks
to make it safer and easier to be performed. Some examples
include:
• At home
 change door knobs to lever type
 replace squatting toilets with sitting toilets
 place regularly used items on reachable shelves
 replace heavy appliances with lighter ones
• At work
 arrange the workspace to make it easier to complete tasks
with the least amount of physical strain
 take breaks from repetitive motion tasks
III. Healthy eating
There is no specific diet that improves or worsens RA. A healthy
and well-balanced diet is important to maintain a healthy
weight and prevent other diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus and
heart disease. In general, a healthy dietary habit includes the
following:
• consume more fresh fruits and vegetables
• reduce sugar and salt
• avoid processed food and high saturated fat diet
• if you drink alcohol, do so in moderation; some people on
certain RA medications may need to avoid alcohol completely
IV. Emotional health
Living with RA can be a challenge. It is normal to feel angry or
frustrated because tasks that used to be done routinely may
now be difficult. Emotional stress may make it harder to deal
with pain. Some steps that you can take to understand and
control your emotional health include:
• avoid things that cause you stress e.g. make changes to
your daily routine to reduce physical strain
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
• make time for things that you enjoy e.g. listening to music
• find positive ways to cope with stress e.g. joining a support
group
• learn relaxation techniques e.g. deep breathing technique
V. Smoking
Smoking is one of the poor prognostic factors for RA. Cessation
of smoking is advisable in view of its association with high CV
risk.
Talk to a health care worker if you are experiencing symptoms of
depression, having relationship problems or facing sleep difficulties.

APPENDIX 5
PRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION
The purpose of joint protection is to allow patients to participate in daily
activities with the least amount of damage to the affected joints. These
principles can help to reduce pain, inflammation and injury caused by
excessive stress on the joint.
The Principles of Joint Protection:
1. Respect pain
There are many activity-related factors influencing the onset and
intensity of joint pain.
Time - the length of time one spends on an activity can influence
pain; e.g. pain resulting from five minutes of an activity may be
manageable, but an hour of the same task may result in pain that
lasts for a few days.
Weight - weight can influence pain in several ways; e.g. carrying a
lighter bag of groceries a few times may not cause any difficulties
but a heavier bag can cause or worsen pain in the affected joint.
Repetition - repetition of an activity can cause or worsen pain;
e.g. stapling a few sheets of paper may not cause any pain, but
repeating this activity 50 times may cause significant pain that
lingers for hours or days.
2. Distribute the load over stronger joints and/or larger surface areas
Small hand joints are vulnerable to pain and inflammation when
overused, causing overstretching of ligaments leading to instability
(a). When possible, spread the load over several joints or to a larger
joint (b).
(a)
(b)
Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis
Poor posture
Good posture
3. Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods
Joints kept in one position for prolonged periods of time are inclined
to get stiff. Immobilisation of a joint for days or weeks can lead to
muscle atrophy and joint contractures. Shifting weight, stretching or
changing positions frequently can alleviate the pain and stiffness.
4. Use good posture and body mechanics
Each joint should be used in its most anatomically stable and
functional plane. Good body mechanics and posture are important
to minimise musculoskeletal strain, thereby preventing or reducing
pain. While it takes more energy initially, once it becomes a habit,
less energy is needed to maintain a good posture.
5. Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job
Squeezing and pinching activities should be avoided, as they tend
to aggravate soft tissue injury and hand deformities. Holding an
object with less effort, taking rest breaks and using special aids can
reduce stress on the joint.

(f)
Photos (a), (c) and (e) indicate the improper ways of performing an
activity.
Photos (b), (d) and (f) show the recommended ways.
6. Simplify work by using efficiency principles: plan, organise,
balance work with rest
Planning, organising and balancing work with rest are useful
principles to be employed in reducing stress on joints.
7. Maintain strength and range of motion
Remain active to maintain/increase strength and range of motion.
Exercise plays an important role in control of body weight, CV fitness
and prevention of coronary heart disease. When individualised for
people with arthritis, exercise is expected to improve rather than
worsen joint pain and function.
