STATEMENT OF INTENT
These guidelines update and supplant the original guidelines developed in 2005 and are
based on the best available contemporary evidence. They are intended as a guide for
the best clinical practices in the management of mandibular condyle fractures presently.
However, it must be noted that adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to
the best clinical outcomes in individual patient care, as every health care provider is
responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical
presentations and management options available locally.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES
These guidelines were issued in June 2019 and will be reviewed in 2024 or earlier if
important new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, the head of the
related specialty will be informed and a multidisciplinary team will be formed
subsequently. A discussion will be made on the need for a revision including the scope
of the revised CPG. The systematic review methodology used by the Malaysia Health
Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed in reviewing the
guidelines.
Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of
publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections will be published in
the web version of this document, which is the definitive version at all times. This version

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) were developed by an expert committee
consisting of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, a Paediatric Dental Specialist, a
Public Health Specialist and a general dentist from the Ministry of Health, the
Ministry of Education and private sector.
The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Unilateral Condylar Fracture of
the Mandible (December 2005) was used as the basis for the development of these
guidelines. The recommendations were formulated taking into consideration the best
available evidence and local practices. Several improvements have been introduced
in this edition. The scope has been expanded to include management of all
mandibular condyle fractures. In addition, new and updated information have been
included in these guidelines. Besides this, clinical audit indicators have also been
identified for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.
Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases: Medline,
Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and Embase while full
text journal articles were retrieved from these databases. The search was limited to
literature published from 2006 to 2017, humans and in English. The reference lists of
all relevant articles retrieved were also searched to identify further studies. Future
CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off period. The search
strategy can be found in Appendix 1. The details of the search strategy can be
obtained upon request from the Oral Health Technology Section, Oral Health
Programme, Ministry of Health Malaysia.
There were eight (8) clinical questions which were assigned to members of the
development group. The group members met a total of 16 times throughout the
development of these guidelines. All retrieved literature were appraised by at least
two members, presented in the form of evidence tables and discussed during group
meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by
both the development group and reviewers. This CPG is based on reference to the
findings of systematic review, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and
case reports, with local practices taken into consideration. However, when there
was a lack of evidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group
members. Although ideally patients’ views and preferences need to be considered in
the development of CPGs, in this instance, it was not feasible.

The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian
Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the formulation of
recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE. The writing of the CPG
strictly follows the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation
(AGREE II).
The draft was reviewed by a panel of internal and external reviewers.
Recommendations were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs,
and finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for approval.

LIST OF KEY MESSAGES
Diagnosis
 A reverse Towne’s view or a posterior-anterior skull view allows
for the evaluation of the possibility of a medial / lateral
displacement in mandibular condyle fractures. It acts as an
adjunct to an OPG in these fractures.
 3-dimension Computed Tomography (3D-CTs) show better
visualisation of the position and displacement of bone fragments,
and comminution of fractures which is useful for surgical
planning in mandibular condyle fractures.
Treatment
The standard outcomes to determine successful treatment of
mandibular condyle fractures are:
 Mouth opening >40mm (adult) and >35mm (children)
 No pain at the affected site
 Mandible has good movements in all directions
 Recovery of pre-injury occlusal relationship (satisfactory to
clinicians and patients)
 Temporomandibular joint stability
 Minimal chin deviation on mouth opening
 No obvious facial asymmetry
 Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of mandibular condyle
fractures shows better outcomes in restoring ramus height and
occlusal status, protrusive and laterotrusive movements, and
preventing chin deviation on opening.
 No one method of Intermaxillary Fixation (IMF) has been shown
to be superior in the management of mandibular condyle
fractures.
 Closed treatment of mandibular condyle fractures shows good
clinical outcomes for paediatric patients.

LIST OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
Diagnosis
 An underlying mandibular condyle fracture should be suspected
and investigated in patients presenting with soft tissue injuries
on the chin and any type of open bite.
 Computed Tomography (CT) or Cone-beam CT scans should be
used in the diagnosis of mandibular condyle fractures when
feasible.
o Plain radiographs may be used as an option.
Treatment
 For closed reduction of mandibular condyle fractures, rigid
intermaxillary fixation (IMF) may be carried out for:
o two weeks followed by 1-2 weeks of elastic IMF or
o three weeks followed by functional treatment
 Open reduction internal fixation of mandibular condyle fracture
should be considered based on the following:
o patient’s factors
o availability of accurate diagnostic facilities
o types of fracture
o surgeon’s experience
 Rehabilitation and regular follow-up should be carried out posttreatment of mandibular condyle fractures to ensure optimum
outcomes.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Mandibular Condyle is the supero-posterior process on the ramus of the
mandible and composed of two parts: a superior part, the articular portion / condylar
head, and an inferior part, the condylar neck (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Anatomy of Mandibular Condyle
The main aetiology for condylar fractures varies according to geographical, socioeconomic and demographic (age and sex) status of the population. Motor vehicle
accidents (MVA), interpersonal violence, falls and sports injuries were the most
common causes seen in developed and developing countries. The mechanism of
injury involved in mandibular condyle fractures were:
 Indirect trauma, in which forces were transferred from the more resistant skeleton
(e.g. chin region anteriorly and body of mandible region laterally) to the
mandibular condyle. 1, level III
 The position of the jaw (open or closed) in relation to the direction and magnitude
of the force also played a part in the type of fractures sustained.
The mandible and zygoma by nature of their location and anatomy, are the two most
commonly fractured facial bones. In Malaysia, studies have shown that fractures of
the mandible range from 42.7% - 83.1% of all facial bone fractures. Inherently weak
areas of the mandible which commonly fracture are the condyle, the angle and the
parasymphysis. Condylar fractures have been reported to account for 19.3% - 33.2%
of mandibular fractures. 2-4, level III
Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures
2
2019
In Malaysia, in children under the age of 15 years, mandibular fractures accounted
for 58.3% - 65% of all facial bone fractures, of which 27% were condylar fractures. 45, level III This is consistent with findings from other centres and is considered as a
characteristic feature of paediatric mandibular fractures.6-7, level III
Due to the high prevalence and incidence of condylar fractures, we should not miss
this diagnosis as it could lead to serious complications such as ankyloses. 8, level
III Refer to Appendix 5.
Management of mandibular condyle fractures consists of surgical and non-surgical
interventions. Irrespective of the treatment methods, several complications such as
pain, restricted mandibular movement, muscle spasm, deviation of the mandible,
malocclusion, pathological changes in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), malunion,
facial asymmetry, and ankylosis have been reported. 8-10, level III Additionally, in
children, fractures of the condylar process may damage the growth centres leading
to altered growth and deformity of the facial skeleton.11, level III
In view of the high prevalence and potential complications of mandibular condyle
fractures, this CPG aims to provide evidence-based guidance on the management of
these fractures.
2. DIAGNOSIS
2.1 Clinical Presentation 12-13, level III
a. General complaints:
 Pain on opening and closing the mouth
 Swelling in front of the ear
 Difficulty in chewing
 Bleeding from the ear
 Difficulty in breathing
b. Examination
i) Extra-oral:

Pre-auricular swelling with ecchymosis and oedema

Facial asymmetry

Soft tissue injuries (abrasions, lacerations) on the chin or pre-auricular
area (Figure 2)

Limitation of mouth opening

Tenderness to palpation over TMJ area and / or condyle is not palpable
on mouth opening and closing

2019

Chin deviation to the affected side on mouth opening and closing (in
cases of unilateral condylar fractures)

Facial weakness (in cases of facial nerve injury)

Sensory disturbances to the lip and chin region (inferior alveolar nerve
courses through the mandibular body and angle. Fractures of the
subcondylar area extending to the bony canal can cause temporary or
permanent anaesthesia of the lip, teeth, and gingiva)

Pre-auricular hollowing (in cases of medial displacement of the condylar
head)
ii) Intra-oral

Malocclusion:
- Anterior open bite (in cases of bilateral condyle fractures) (Figure 2)
- Premature posterior contact on the affected side and open bite on
unaffected side (in cases of unilateral condyle fracture)
- Posterior open bite on the affected side (due to haemarthrosis)

Recommendation 1

An underlying mandibular condyle fracture should be suspected and
investigated in patients presenting with soft tissue injuries on the chin and any
type of open bite.
2.2 Investigations - Imaging
Imaging modalities such as plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scans,
and cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans, are the main investigations in the diagnosis of
mandibular condyle fracture.

2019
2.2.1 Plain Radiographs
 Orthopantomogram (OPG)
OPG is commonly used in the diagnosis of a variety of dental and maxillofacial
conditions (Figure 3). Image quality using digital OPG with post-processing
(manipulation of contrast and image density) was better than without post-processing
and film-based OPG (p<0.05).14,level III However, OPG was less accurate in
determining condylar fractures compared with CT scans. 15-16, level III


Other Plain Radiographs
Other plain radiographs used in the diagnosis of mandibular condyle fractures are
lateral oblique, transcranial, reverse Towne’s, and posterior-anterior (PA) views.17-18,
level III Reverse Towne’s or PA views are frontal projection radiographs. They allow for
the evaluation of a medial / lateral displacement in mandibular condyle fractures. 18,
level III
There is no retrievable evidence on the effectiveness and safety of plain
radiographs. However, it is known that most of these imaging techniques are less
helpful due to the superimposition of the facial bone complex.17,19, level III (Figure 4

Key Message 1
 A reverse Towne’s view or a posterior-anterior skull view allows for the
evaluation of the possibility of a medial / lateral displacement in mandibular
condyle fractures. It acts as an adjunct to an OPG in these fractures.
2.2.2 Computed Tomography (CT)
CT scans are useful in the diagnosis of mandibular condyle fractures. It allows a 3dimensional (3D) assessment of the condyle in relation to the mandibular fossa
without superimposition of interfering structures.19, level III It is used to classify types of
condylar trauma and also needed to determine condyle displacement into middle
cranial fossa or external auditory canal.20, level III Immediate total body CT scans are
usually performed in patients with polytrauma. Therefore, it can be obtained earlier
than OPG.17, level III
CT scans are more sensitive in the diagnosis of mandibular condyle fractures
compared to OPGs (100% vs 87.5%).15, level III In terms of assessment of suspected
condylar fractures in children, CT scans have better accuracy than OPG with
sensitivity of 92% and 70%, and specificity of 87% and 77% respectively. 21, level III
Coronal CTs were more accurate in determining type of mandibular condyle
fractures compared with conventional radiographs (OPG and posteroanterior
mandibular radiographs) in high neck condylar fractures of the mandible (Spiessl III
and V).16, level III
2-dimensional (2D) (Figure 7) and 3-dimensional (3D) CT (Figure 8) images have
equal accuracy in the diagnosis of mandibular condyle fractures. However, when
compared with observation during surgery, 3D-CT showed better visualisation of the
position and displacement of bone fragments, and comminution of mandibular
condyle fractures than 2D-CT. Thus, it is useful for surgical planning.22, level III

Key Message 2
 3D-CTs show better visualisation of the position and displacement of bone
fragments, and comminution of fractures which is useful for surgical planning
in mandibular condyle fractures.
2.2.3 Cone-beam Computed Tomograph (CBCT)
CBCT scans are very suitable for maxillofacial imaging. The images produced are
2D and 3D, similar to CT scans (Figure 9). In addition, CBCT scans produce less
metal artifacts but is not reliable in viewing soft tissue.23-24, level III
Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures
10
2019
CBCT scans were able to confirm suspected mandibular fractures (based on clinical,
OPG and / or PA skull) in 63.2% of sites (p<0.0001). Therefore, it is useful as an
alternative to CT scans for ambulatory patients without history of loss of
consciousness. 25, level III

Figure 9: CBCT of mandibular condylar fracture
Recommendation 2
 Computed Tomography (CT) or Cone-beam CT scans should be used in the
diagnosis of mandibular condyle fractures when feasible.
o Plain radiographs may be used as an option.
2.3 Classification
The classification of the mandibular condyle fractures takes the following into
consideration:
 anatomical regions
 direction and degree of displacement
 relationship between the condylar head and the glenoid fossa
The two most commonly used classifications are Lindahl (refer to Appendix 3) and
Spiessl and Schroll (refer to Appendix 4).
Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures

3. MANAGEMENT
Treatment
modalities
for
mandibular
condyle
fractures
are
conservative
management, closed reduction (CR) and open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF).
Choice of treatment modality for each patient depends on the following factors: 26-27,
level III

fracture (e.g. age, position and location of fracture, and associated injuries)

patient (e.g. age, compliance, systemic medical conditions, cosmetic impact
and patient’s preference)

surgeon (e.g. experience and preference)
Other factors that should be considered in choosing the treatment modality are cost
and anaesthesia time.
3.1 Conservative
The definition of conservative management for mandibular condyle fractures varies.
However, in this CPG it refers to management with:

Soft diet

Physiotherapy (e.g. mouth-opening exercise)

Analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications
This management is indicated for diacapitular or condylar head fractures in
paediatric patients. 28, level II-2
3.2 Closed Reduction
Closed treatment (refer to Appendix 6) is defined as treatment that does not involve
surgical exposure of the fracture. This usually consists of a period of intermaxillary
fixation (IMF) using either stainless steel wires, elastics or a combination of both
followed by physiotherapy.
When comparing different types of IMF, Schuchardt’s device (acrylated archbar) or
screws alone have no difference in the functional outcome, but the insertion of 4 - 6
screws requires much less time and is less harmful to the teeth and the
periodontium. 27, level III
Evidence suggests rigid IMF for 2 weeks followed by 1-2 weeks of elastic IMF 29-30,
level I or 3 weeks of rigid IMF followed by functional treatment. 27, level III For
intra-capsular condylar fractures, 10 days of IMF followed by a functional orthodontic
activator is suggested. 13, 27, level III
Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures
12
2019
Recommendation 3
 For closed reduction of mandibular condyle fractures, rigid intermaxillary
fixation (IMF) may be carried out for:
o two weeks followed by 1-2 weeks of elastic IMF or
o three weeks followed by functional treatment
3.3 Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF)
ORIF involves surgical exposure of the fracture, anatomical reduction, followed by
osteosynthesis. Surgical approaches for ORIF can be retromandibular / transparotid,
pre-auricular, submandibular, endoscopic assisted intra-oral approach 27, level III or a
combination of these approaches (refer to Appendix 7).
The absolute indications for open reduction in children and adults are as follows:

displacement into middle cranial fossa 31, level lII

inability to obtain adequate occlusion 31, level lIl ; 32, level II-2

lateral extra-capsular displacement of the condyle 31, level llI

presence of a foreign body (e.g. gunshot wound) 31, level lII
The relative indications (primarily in adults) are as follows:

when closed reduction is not recommended for medical reasons (e.g. patients
with seizure disorders, psychiatric problems, alcoholism, refractory behaviour,
mental retardation or retardation secondary to neurologic injury)
Other indications:

failed conservative treatment

failed closed reduction treatment

medial dislocation of condyle >30°; displaced fractures with >5mm bone
overlap; or complete loss of bone contact 33, level llI

shortening of the ascending ramus of > 8mm; or when considerable
displacement or angulation in a coronal and/or sagittal plane is present
26, level III, 34, level II-1

displacement of the condylar head from the glenoid fossa 26, level III;

mechanical obstruction of jaw opening caused by a displaced condylar head

bilateral mandibular condylar fractures 30, level I

unilateral or bilateral mandibular condylar fractures with severely comminuted
midfacial fractures 32, level II-2
ORIF in intra-capsular condylar fractures is controversial because it carries a high
risk of avascular necrosis, 30, level I; 32, level II-2 osseous and fibrosis ankyloses. 30, level I

Closed reduction has been the preferred treatment for many years. However, longterm complications associated with it include open bite, pain, inadequate restoration
of vertical height of the ramus, arthritis, and deviation of the mandible. 35, level I This
has led to a trend towards open treatment which allows anatomical repositioning and
internal fixation, hence, improving functional aftercare. 36-37, level III However ORIF is
also associated with complications such as facial nerve injury and visible scars. 38,
level I
Key Message 3
The standard outcomes to determine successful treatment of mandibular condyle
fractures are:
 Mouth opening >40mm (adult) and >35mm (children)
 No pain at the affected site
 Mandible has good movements in all directions
 Recovery of preinjury occlusal relationship (satisfactory to clinicians and
patients)
 TMJ stability
 Minimal chin deviation on mouth opening

No obvious facial asymmetry
In two meta-analysis, when compared with closed reduction in the management of
mandibular condyle fractures, ORIF showed:
 higher maximal mouth opening 39, level I
 decreased occurrence of malocclusion 39-40, level I
 reduced pain (VAS score) 40, level I
There was no significant difference in temporomandibular joint pain, facial symmetry
and mandibular activity between both treatment modalities.39, level I However, another
meta-analysis and an RCT showed no significant difference in mouth opening
between ORIF and closed reduction. 29, level I ; 32, level II-2
ORIF was better when compared with closed reduction in terms of:
 protrusion 32, level II-2; 40, level I
 lateroexcursion 32, level II-2; 40, level I
 ramus height shortening 40, level I

Immediate post-treatment assessment showed ORIF was better than closed
reduction in the following outcomes:
 medio-lateral angulation of fractured condyle 29, 41, level I
 restoring ramus height 29, 41, level I
 occlusal status 29, 41, level I
However, at six months, there was no significant difference between ORIF and
closed reduction for all outcomes except for deviation of mouth opening (0% vs
70%). 29, 41, level I
A meta-analysis on management of mandibular condyle fracture in adults showed
ORIF was superior to closed reduction in the following outcomes at 6 - 36 months:
38, level I
 maximal inter-incisal opening (WMD=3.32 mm, 95% CI 2.42 to 4.04 mm)
 laterotrusive movement (WMD=1.14 mm, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.55 mm)
 protrusive movement (WM=.99 mm, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29 mm)
 malocclusion (OR=0.41, 95% CI 0. 26 to 0.62 mm)
 chin deviation on mouth opening (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.99 mm)
However, there was no significant difference in pain between both groups.
Key Message 4
 ORIF of mandibular condyle fractures shows better outcomes in restoring ramus
height and occlusal status, protrusive and laterotrusive movements, and
preventing chin deviation on opening.
Recommendation 4
 ORIF of mandibular condyle fracture should be considered based on the
following:
o patient’s factors
o availability of accurate diagnostic facilities
o types of fracture
o surgeon’s experience

3.5 Mandibular Condyle Fractures in Children
In children below the age of 5 years, condylar fractures were seen in 76 % of
mandibular fractures. 42, level II-3 This reduced to 50% in patients aged 13-15 years. 42,
level II-3 Unilateral condylar fractures represented 83 % of the fractures.
Mandibular condylar fractures in this group are unique as there is a significant
correlation between age and site of condylar fracture. 13, 42, level II-3
Intra-capsular fractures were more commonly seen in children aged below 12 years
old. 42, level II-3 In children, sagittal fractures of the mandibular condyle were commonly
seen and 4% to 26% of cases were complicated by ankyloses. 40, level I
CT scan is the gold standard for radiographic investigations in a paediatric patient
presenting with clinical sign and symptoms suggestive of an underlying condylar
fractures. 13, level III
The management of MCF in the paediatric group consists of conservative, closed
reduction and ORIF, with closed reduction being the most common practice. 43, level III
i) Conservative treatment in the paediatric patients especially in diacapitular and
condylar head fractures consists of: 28, level III ; 44, level III
 Liquid or soft diet for several weeks with close observation
 Functional exercises and/or physiotherapy
ii) Closed reduction consists of:
 IMF with rigid wires and/or elastics for a period of 7-10 days. There was no
difference in clinical outcomes between the two methods for children below 12
years old. 13, 45, level III
 Functional appliance therapy– design of the appliance and duration of
application is based on individual specific treatment objectives with the overall
aim of re-establishing the vertical dimension of the face.
 Occlusal splints - thickness and duration of the splint is dependent on the
dental developmental stage and classification of the fracture 13, 46, level III
Closed treatment in paediatric condylar fracture yields generally good results and
adequate condylar remodelling with few major complications. Favourable clinical
outcomes were found in 74% of the patients. For subjective assessment, 83% had
no subjective symptom and 98% describe chewing function as normal.
Radiographically 87% remodelling was considered complete. However, it should be
noted that radiographic and clinical outcomes are not correlated, in which
satisfactory outcome was found even though the radiograph did not show this.
43, level III
Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures
16
2019
Because of the increased risk of joint dysfunction and aberration in mandibular
growth, non-surgical management should be considered the first line treatment for
paediatric condylar fractures. 28, level III
iii) ORIF
There is limited evidence on the effectiveness and safety of ORIF in paediatric
patients. However, there are case reports describing the use of resorbable plates in
paediatric patients.
Key Message 5
 No one method of IMF used in closed reduction has been shown to be superior
in the management of mandibular condyle fractures.
Key Message 6
 Closed treatment of mandibular condyle fractures shows good clinical outcomes
for paediatric patients.
3.6 Post-treatment complications
Complications related to surgical management of MCF are infrequent. 47, level III
Reported complications are:
a) facial nerve damage (8.6%, of which 8.3% was temporary and 0.3% was
permanent)
b) breakage or loss of repair materials (1.79%)
c) salivary leakage (1.62%)
d) salivary fistula (1.11%)
e) infection (0.60%)
f) Frey’s syndrome (0.51%)
g) hemorrhage (0.17%)
h) seroma (0.17%)
i) sialocele (0.17%)
j) acoustics effects (0.17%)
k) condylar resorption (0.09%)
l) incorrect repositioning (0.09%)
m) pre-auricular hyperaesthesia (0.09%)
Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures
17
2019
Complications related to surgical approaches are discussed in Appendix 7.
In closed reduction, reported complications are:
a) malocclusion (p<0.001) 47, level III
b) inadequate remodeling (3.05% of cases ,13 out of 425 cases) 47, level III
c) TMJ dysfunction (p=0.015) 47, level III
In children, the added concern in treatment of mandibular condylar fractures is its
effect on growth and development of the jaw. However there is no retrievable high
level evidence on this.
4. REHABILITATION
There is no retrievable evidence on effectiveness and safety of any one method of
rehabilitation in MCF. The development group consensus on rehabilitation for MCF
in paediatric or adult patients consist of:
a) Early mobilisation:
IMF not more than 2 weeks in condylar head (intracapsular) fracture
b) Active jaw movements:
Intensification of jaw exercise after removal of rigid IMF, for at least 6 months
c) Close supervision:
Weekly visit as outpatient in the first 30 days post treatment
d) Compliance by the patients:
Comply to the treatment protocol (refer to Appendix 8) and follow up schedule
5. FOLLOW-UP
There is also no retrievable evidence on any effective protocol for follow-up in
mandibular condyle fractures.
Based on development group consensus, regular follow-up is required until the
following outcome criteria are achieved:

satisfactory occlusion

maximal inter incisal distance is more than 35 mm for children, and 41 mm for
adults

deviation from the midline during mouth opening is less than 3 mm

protrusion of 5 mm, and laterotrusion of 6 mm

no sign of ankylosis

no functional and growth disturbance
Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures
18
2019

until permanent dentition is established in children with deciduous / mixed
dentition
Recommendation 5
 Rehabilitation and regular follow-up should be carried out post-treatment of
mandibular condyle fractures to ensure optimum outcomes.
6. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
It is important to standardise the management of mandibular condyle fractures at all
healthcare facilities in Malaysia using an evidence-based CPG in order to manage it
appropriately. Recognition of signs and symptoms and appropriate responses from
the health professionals are important factors in management of mandibular condyle
fractures. Clinicians are required to keep abreast with knowledge through continuing
professional education as well as understanding of patient expectations. Therefore, it
is important for these guidelines to be disseminated to healthcare professionals in all
healthcare facilities.
Cost implications on management of mandibular condyle fractures vary depending
on several factors such as patients’ co-morbidities and expectations and type of
treatment advocated. Successful treatment outcomes would require proper clinical
and radiographic assessment thus involving further cost.
6.1
Facilitating and Limiting Factors
Wide spread practise of this CPG can be facilitated by:
a) Dissemination of the CPG to healthcare professionals and teaching
institutions via printed and electronic copies
b) Continuing professional education on the management of mandibular
condyle fractures for healthcare professionals
c) Presence of adequate resources in all healthcare facilities for diagnosing
and treating of mandibular condyle fractures
Limiting factors for application of the recommendations of the CPG include:
a) Lack of understanding or limited knowledge on the management of
mandibular condyle fractures
b) Variation in skills and treatment practices
c) Constraints in equipment and facilities
d) Inadequate funds

6.2
Potential Resource Implications
Potential resources implications to implement the CPG are as follows:
a) Widespread distribution of this CPG to all healthcare facilities.
b) Re-enforce training of healthcare professionals to ensure knowledge and
information is up to date.
6.3 Proposed Clinical Audit Indicators
To assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed as clinical
audit indicators for quality management:
Percentage of satisfactory
occlusion in the treated
mandibular condyle
fractures
=
Number of patients with
satisfactory occlusion in the
treated mandibular condyle
fractures within a year
X 100%
Total number of patients with
treated mandibular condyle
fractures in the same period
Standard: More than 90%

Complications of Undiagnosed and Untreated MCF
Untreated condylar fractures lead to complications such as malocclusion, pain,
mandibular hypomobility, TMJ problems and ankyloses and facial deformity.
Malocclusion
Untreated unilateral condylar fractures may have premature contact on the affected
posterior teeth, open bite on the contralateral posterior teeth and deviation of
mandible to the affected side. For bilateral condylar fractures, the malocclusion
commonly present is an anterior open bite.
Mandibular hypomobility
Mandibular hypomobility can be defined in general as inter-incisal opening less than
40 mm to frank ankyloses. 48, level III The affected mandibular movement includes
maximum inter-incisal opening (MIO), lateral excursive and protrusive jaw
movements are frequently adversely affected by mandibular condyle trauma.
Temporomandibular joint complications
 Pain
Pain is usually moderate and located in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area or
muscles of mastication such as temporalis and masseter of the affected site. 49, level III
The pain is usually present on mouth opening but occasionally may be present
during occlusion.
 Temporo-mandibular joint derangement
TMJ derangement occurs when there is a change in the shape of the disc. This
could lead to disc displacement and the major symptoms include joint sound,
abnormal movement of the condyle head, impingement of condyle head, mandibular
movement limitation and joint pain. For TMJ derangement, changes in disc shape
and the functional disorders of the condyle-disc complex are minimized and
prevented by the early reduction and rigid fixation of the displaced bone fragments
adjacent to the joint.

 TMJ ankylosis
Ankylosis is the most common cause of hypomobility. Ankylosis is divided into intracapsular ankylosis and extra-capsular ankylosis. The ankylosis that is associated
with the untreated condylar fractures is the intra-capsular type. The subtypes of intracapsular ankylosis according to Sawhney (1986) 50, level III are:
i) Type 1: minimal bony fusion but extensive fibrous adhesions around the joint
ii) Type II: there is more bony fusion, especially at the outer edge of the joint surface,
but no fusion within the more medial area of the joint
iii) Type III: there is a bridge of bone between the mandible and the temporal bone
iv) Type IV: the joint is replaced by a mass of bone
 Traumatic arthritis of the TMJ
Traumatic arthritis is an arthritis that occurs secondarily after the deformity of the
joint. It is caused by direct injury to the articular cartilage or fracture due to trauma.
In the intra-capsular fracture of the condyles, articular surface injury occurs during
the trauma onset, and subsequently traumatic arthritis occurs due to chronic and
repeated joint movement. 51, level III Clinical symptoms that may occur in an early
phase include joint sound and pain during joint movement. As bony arthritis
progresses, joint sound increases and as well as lock sensation, pain, and mouth
opening limitation.
Facial deformity
Decreased mandibular growth occurs in 20% to 25% of patients with mandibular
condyle fracture. 51, level III This growth abnormality has been reported to be attributed
to direct condylar growth and severe functional disorders caused by adjacent
muscular stiffness, injury of soft tissues, and scars. The clinical features may include
mandibular retrognathism, anterior open bite, chin deviation and contralateral
posterior open bite. 52, level III

Surgical approaches
1. Pre-auricular approach
 Indications: condylar head and upper neck fractures
 Mohan et al. (2012) found, when compared with the retromandibular
approach, the pre-auricular approach had more postoperative facial nerve
weakness which they attributed to retraction injury to access lower neck
fractures. 53, level III
 Cosmetically, the scar is well hidden within the pre-auricular crease. 53, level III
2. Retromandibular approach
 Indications: direct access to the ramus and the condylar neck with minimal
retraction.
 Risk of facial nerve damage via the retromandibular approach is minimal. This
risk is increased with prolonged traction at the operative site, surgeon’s
experience, post injury edema, and other factors causing difficult wound
access such as obesity. 29, level I
3. Submandibular approach
 Indications: access to ramus and low subcondylar fractures.
 Submandibular approach showed higher incidence of facial nerve palsy and a
higher percentage of visible/hyperthropic scars compared to other surgical
approaches to the mandibular condyle. 27, level III
 Paralysis or paresis of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve can
also occur either from direct injury or from retraction forces
Overall, scarring in open reduction was described as acceptable in most cases. 27,

4. Endoscopic-assisted reduction and internal fixation (ERIF) 38, level I, 57, level III
Indication: lower condylar fractures where dislocation with lateral override is present.
 This is an intraoral approach using an endoscope to assist in visualization.
Right-angle drills and screw drivers are used to assist in fixation.
 However, ERIF has a steep learning curve and requires well trained assistants
5. Osteosynthesis in ORIF
The introduction and implementation of better materials for osteosynthesis over the
past 30 years have broadened the indications for surgical treatment of mandibular
condylar fractures. 32, level II-2, 38, level I
Two four-holes miniplates have been the gold standard since the early 2000s. The
fixation of MCF with 2 miniplates is more stable than a single plate repair 27, level III as
it avoids high mechanical strain complications such as TMJ disorders, non-union or
fibrous union. 57, level III
Multiple variations of condylar plates have been advocated to improve rigid fixation
such as two parallel plates, angulated straight plates, 3D plates such as: Y, delta,
lambda square and trapezoidal condylar plates (TCP). Recently TCP has increased
in popularity – it is thought to better achieve the principle of functionally stable
osteosynthesis as described by Champy. 57, level III

Rehabilitation protocol
A) Paediatric Patient
The protocol for rehabilitation with removable splint: 58, level II-2
 A removable occlusal splint with varying thickness is fabricated according to the
age, developmental stage of the mandible, and degree of condylar dislocation.
This is worn for 1-3 months, accompanied by functional exercises.
 Under parental supervision, children are instructed to have a soft diet and wear a
removable semihard occlusal splint for 1-3 months, 24 hour per day until
restoration of the occlusion relationship.
 Mouth opening exercises begin at the third week after injury and included vertical
opening, contralateral excursions, and protrusive movements in front of a mirror.
 Exercises continued for more than 6 months.
In addition, the group suggests the use of guiding elastics if necessary as an adjunct.
B) Adult Patient
In adults, either open or closed treatment, early rehabilitation is essential to have a
good functional outcome. The protocol post treatment is as follows: 56, level III
 Guidance elastics for 7 days
 Elastics at night for an additional 7 days
 Soft diet for 30 days
 Functional exercise from day 15 onwards
 Intensification of functional therapy from day 30 to at least 6 months
 Weekly visit as outpatient in the first 45 days post op
 Monthly for the following 6 months
However, this recommendation can be tailored to individual clinical needs.
