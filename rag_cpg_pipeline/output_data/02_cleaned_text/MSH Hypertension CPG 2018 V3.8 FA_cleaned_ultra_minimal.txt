STATEMENT OF INTENT
This guideline was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the management
of hypertension. All efforts were made to ensure references quoted were the most
current at the time of printing. Specific attempts were made to use local data and
publications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline may not necessarily
lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care. Every health care provider
is responsible for the care of his/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation
and treatment options available locally. However, adherence to this guideline is strongly
recommended as a starting point in managing patients as it constitute the best available
evidence at the time of writing.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES
This guideline was issued in 2018 and will be reviewed in 2023 or earlier if important
new evidence becomes available. This is an update to the Clinical Practice Guideline
on Management of Hypertension – 4th Edition (published 2013) and supersedes the
previous. Electronic version will be made available on the following websites:

DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
The panel members had completed disclosure forms. None held shares in pharmaceutical
firms or acted as consultants to such firms. Some may have been engaged as speakers in
conferences or Continuing Professional Development activities mainly organised by the
Malaysian Medical Association, the Malaysian Society of Hypertension, National Heart
Association of Malaysia or similar professional non-governmental associations (NGOs).
These events may or may not have received financial assistance from pharmaceutical
companies as part of an educational grants (details are available upon request from the
CPG Secretariat).
SOURCE OF FUNDING
The development of the CPG on Management of Hypertension (5th Edition) was
supported via unconditional educational grant from Servier Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. The
funding body was not involved in and has no influence on the development of the
guidelines. An independent third party was engaged for all secretarial task and was
appointed by and reported directly to the Malaysian Society of Hypertension.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
1. Hypertension is defined as persistent elevation of systolic BP of 140mmHg
or greater and/or diastolic BP of 90 mmHg or greater.
2. The prevalence of hypertension in Malaysians aged 18 years and above
was 35.3% in 2015, a slight increase from 33.6% in 2011.
3. Hypertension is a silent disease; unfortunately, in 2015, for every two
diagnosed patients in Malaysia there are 3 undiagnosed patients. This
has not changed since 2011. Blood pressure should be measured at every
chance encounter.
4. Untreated or sub-optimally controlled hypertension leads to increased
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal morbidity/ mortality and overall
mortality.
5. A systolic BP of 120 to 139 mmHg and/or diastolic BP of 85 to 89 mmHg
is defined as ‘at risk blood pressure’ and should be treated in certain high
risk groups.
6. Healthy living should be recommended for all individuals with hypertension
and ‘at risk blood pressure’.
7. Decisions on pharmacological treatment should be based on global
vascular risks and not on the level of blood pressure per se.
8. In patients with newly diagnosed uncomplicated hypertension and no
compelling indications, choice of first line monotherapy includes ACEIs,
ARBs, CCBs, diuretics and ß-blockers.
9. Only 37.4% of Malaysian patients achieved blood pressure control (<140/90
mmHg) while on treatment. Although this is an improvement from 2011
(34.7%) every effort should be made to achieve target blood pressure in
all patients. Target blood pressure depends on specific patient groups.
10. Combination therapy is often required to achieve target and may be
instituted early in patients with stage II hypertension and in high risk
stage I hypertension.
11. A patients whose BP is not controlled on three or more drugs (including a
diuretic) is by definition having resistant hypertension.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
In 2015 the Ministry of Health released data from the National Health and Mortality
Survey which focused on Non Communicable Diseases. Diseases of the heart and
circulatory system (Cardiovascular diseases or CVD) still dominates the national health
landscape being the number 1 cause of morbidity and mortality for the last few decades
and is projected to do so for years to come. Of all the risk factors contributing to CVD,
hypertension confer the greatest risk for both male and female based on the latest
national burden of disease in 2008. It is thus pertinent that all health care providers
directly or indirectly involved with CVD know what is latest in the management of
hypertension.
I will like to record my utmost appreciation to all the members of the Working Group
on Hypertension for their tireless effort in coming up with this latest edition of the
Hypertension Clinical Practice Guideline. This is the fifth in the series since it was
first launched in 1998. This reflects the rapid evolution of knowledge in hypertension
driven by major outcome trials for which there were a few since the last edition 5
years ago. There are also more Malaysian studies quoted which is a testimony of the
growing research interest in the topic nationally. I am happy to report that in some
of the landmark multicentre clinical trials quoted, Malaysian researchers were actively
involved. A special thanks to the Health Technology Assessment Unit of the Ministry of
Health Malaysia for ensuring that the development of this CPG conforms to the high
standards it had laid down.
Although the NHMS 2015 showed some positive developments in important key
indicators on hypertension, there is still a lot of scope for improvement. It is hoped
that this latest edition of the Hypertension CPG will continue to play an important role
in controlling this major CVD risk factor. It is the hope of the Working Group that the
release of this new edition will be followed by concerted effort by various stakeholders
to implement the recommendations made. By so doing, we will have contributed in
a significant way to combat the scourge of CVD particularly pre mature CVD. If that
happens, this CPG will have served its purpose, God Willing.
Yours Sincerely,
Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman
Chairman, Working Group on Hypertension CPG 2018

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
RATIONALE
The Clinical Practice Guideline on the Management of Hypertension was developed
to provide a clear and concise approach to all health care providers on the current
concepts in the management of hypertension. Since hypertension is managed by various
levels of health care providers in Malaysia, attempts were made to ensure the different
stakeholders will benefit from this CPG. This is reflected by the representation of the
committee members who developed the guideline. There were four previous guidelines
on hypertension; in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2013.This edition is the fifth in the series and
was deemed necessary due to new evidence which has emerged since the last edition.
Prior to the publication of this edition, the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015
was published. The results of the survey showed that the prevalence of hypertension has
increased while the awareness has decreased compared to a similar survey done in 2011.
However the rate of blood pressure control in the hypertensive population has increased
by 10% (now 37.4% of treated patients are controlled). This rate of blood pressure control
is still poor when one compares with a large nation like Canada where the control rate
was more than 80%. This may reflect the fact that clinicians are still not clear of the target
blood pressure to achieve in their patients. It is hoped that this CPG will contribute
towards achieving the desired targets.
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
The members of the Development Group (DG) for this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG)
were from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and
private healthcare providers. The membership of the DG was multidisciplinary and most
specialties are represented by at least 2 experts. These are Cardiovascular Medicine,
Nephrology, Geriatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Family Medicine and Clinical
Pharmacology/Clinical Pharmacy. There are also specialties which are represented by 1
expert. These include Endocrinology, Neurology and Public Health. Where there are at
least 2 members, 1 act as the principal author and the other reviewer of the initial draft.
Each draft will then be reviewed collectively in every DG meeting.
The CPG update was done based on the CPG Management of Hypertension 4th
edition of 2013. In the update, systematic review methodology was used and the scope
covered include epidemiology and public health, definition and classification, blood
pressure management, diagnostic criteria, investigations, global cardiovascular risk
evaluation, general principle of management, non pharmacological and pharmacological
management, management of patient sub groups and approach to resistant and
refractory hypertension. Emerging areas in hypertension are also covered including
Health Economics, Device Based treatment and scope for future research. A literature
Rationale and Process of Guidelines
Development
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
search was carried out using the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid
and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines
International Network. The search was done on Published English literature focusing
mainly but not exclusively on Clinical Trials. Important observation studies, where relevant,
were also looked at. Unlike some CPGs, the search was not limited to literature published
in the last fifteen years. This is because hypertension management has be powered and
driven by good evidence generated over the last thirty years. Some seminal and practice
changing trials were conducted a few decades ago and the result so conclusive that
repeating the trials will be an act of futility. In addition, the reference lists of all recent
Hypertension Guidelines i.e that written over the last 5 years only were retrieved and
searched to further identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 24 May
2017 to 5 January 2018. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at
the end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published after
January 2018 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after
this cut-off date.
References were also made to the most recent CPG on Hypertension from the American
College of Cardiology / American Heart Association released in full in December 2017.
This CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation
(AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.
A total of 23 clinical questions were developed under 13 different sections. Members of
the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer to Appendix 5 for
Clinical Questions). The DG members met 9 times throughout the development of these
Guideline. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using
Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and further
discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated after
that were agreed upon. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were
made by consensus of the DG. This CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic
reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials in particular trials where Malaysia participated.
Where evidence are lacking or non existent, local practices are taken into consideration.
The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive
Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of recommendation was
done using the principles of Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (Version 1.0
updated July 2017). The writing of the CPG follows strictly the requirement of AGREE II.
On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external reviewers both nationally
and internationally. It was also posted on the Malaysian Society of Hypertension (MSH)
official website for feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to
the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia
for review and approval. Details on the CPG development methodology by MaHTAS
can be obtained from Manual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based
Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh.gov.my/
index.php/pages/view/117).
Rationale and Process of Guidelines Development
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
OBJECTIVES
This guideline is intended to provide education and awareness on the proper
ways to:
1. diagnose hypertension

This guideline is intended to provide evidence on the:
1. optimal management of a patient with hypertension
2. latest therapeutics on subgroups of hypertensive patients
EXCLUSION
This guideline, however, does not cover:
1. strategies for hypertension screening
2. strategies to reduce population blood pressure
CLINICAL QUESTIONS
The two major clinical questions to be addressed in this guideline include:
1. What are the current best practices in the management of a patient with
hypertension?
2. How can hypertension management be done in tandem with the overall strategy
to manage global vascular risk of a patient?
For further detail, please refer Appendix 5.

Malaysians are undiagnosed.
B
Check BP for every adult above age 18 years at least
once as part of their annual health screening, and more
frequently for those who are at risk (family history, obese
and those at-risk of high blood pressure).
B
Use electronic blood pressure measurement devices instead
of mercury sphygmomanometers despite the latter being a
gold standard for non-invasive measurement. (NEW)
C
Before measuring BP, check if patients have stopped
smoking, eating, drinking caffeinated drinks, have not been
exercising for at least 30 minutes, be seated for at least 1
min in a quiet room, back & arm supported, (e.g. resting on
the table), be seated with legs uncrossed, stopped talking
and is relaxed.
C
Check and use the correct bladder cuff size with placement
at heart level.
C
Encourage patient to do home BP monitoring (HBPM)
which helps to empower them and may improve medication
adherence.

GRADE
Management
of Severe
Hypertension
Hypertensive Urgencies
Do not reduce BP rapidly (within minutes to hours) in
hypertensive urgencies as it may precipitate ischaemic
events.
C
For patients whose BP responded with adequate rest (after 2
hours), discharge them with Hypertensive Urgency Discharge
Plan. (NEW)
B
For patients whose BP do not respond to adequate rest,
start with combination oral pharmacotherapy targeting a BP
reduction of 25% within 24 hours.
C
Hypertensive Emergencies
Reduce BP by 10%-25% within minutes to hours but not
lower than 160/100 mmHg. This is best achieved with
parenteral drugs. (NEW)
B
Reduce SBP to less than 140 mmHg during the first hour
for patients with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, and
pheochromocytoma crisis. Reduce to less than 120 mmHg
for patients with aortic dissection.
C
Reduce BP by no more than 25% within the first hour; then,
if stable, to 160/100 mmHg within the next 2 to 6 hours; and
then cautiously to normal during the following 24 to 48 hours
in all other situations.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Hypertension is defined as persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140
mmHg or greater and/or diastolic BP of 90 mmHg or greater, taken at least twice on two
separate occasions.
Although there is an attempt to redefine hypertension as >130 and/or 80 mmHg,1 this
Committee recommends that the old recommendation remains. The Committee is of
the opinion the proposed lower definition will not change the way we treat our patients,
particularly those with cardiovascular complications with BP equal to or more than
130/80 mmHg needs treatment to lower BP regardless.
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) is already the main cause of death in Malaysia
(Figure 1-A) and the biggest contributor in terms of disability life-years (DALYs), with
high blood pressure the biggest contributor for both males and females2 (Figure 1-B).

Chapter 1. Epidemiology, Definition and Classification of Hypertension
FIGURE 1-B DALYs Attributable to Risk Factors, Malaysia 20082
The latest National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) for NCD risk factors in 20153
showed an overall prevalence of hypertension of 35.3% among adults 18 years and
above. This is an increase from 33.6% in 2011 as compared to 34.6% in 2006. However,
in terms of awareness, only 37.5% were aware in 2015 a drop from 40.7% in 2011. In
2006, the awareness rate was 35.6%.3
No significant difference between gender was observed. There was a general increasing
trend in prevalence with age, from 6.7% in the 18-19 years age group, reaching a peak
of 75.4% among the 70-74 years age group. Based on the 2015 survey, prevalence was
the highest among other Bumiputras (37.3%) followed by Malays (36.4%), Indian (34.9%)
and Chinese (34.2%).3
Hypertension was more prevalent in the rural area in all three NHMS: 36.9% versus
32.9% (2006), 36.5% versus 32.6% (2011) and 39.2% versus 34.1% (2015). In terms of
gender differences, hypertension was more prevalent among males; 35.3% versus
33.9% (2006), 34.2% versus 33% (2011) and 35.9% versus 34.8% (2015).
The relationship between BP and risk of cardiovascular events is continuous, consistent
and independent of other risk factors. The higher the BP, the greater the chance of
myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and kidney diseases. The presence of each
additional risk factor, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus or smoking status,
compounds the risk. Therefore, the main aim of identifying and treating high BP is to
reduce these risks of end organ damage or end organ complications. The classification
of clinic BP levels in adults is shown in Table 1-A.

1.1 Isolated Systolic Hypertension
Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is defined as SBP of ≥140 mmHg and DBP <90
mmHg. It is common after the age of 50, and carries with it a poor prognosis. Clinical
trials have demonstrated that control of ISH reduces total mortality, cardiovascular
mortality, stroke and heart failure events.5,6,7
Changing patterns of BP occur with increasing age. The rise in SBP continues throughout
life in contrast to DBP, which rises until approximately age 50, tends to level off over
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 1. Epidemiology, Definition and Classification of Hypertension
• Hypertension is defined as persistent elevation of systolic BP of 140 mmHg
or greater and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or greater, taken at
least twice on two separate occasions.
• Measure BP at every opportunity as a high number of Malaysians are
undiagnosed.
• Check BP for every adult above age 18 years at least once as part of their
annual health screening, and more frequently for those who are at risk
(family history, obese and those at-risk of high blood pressure).
the next decade, and may remain the same or fall later in life.8,9 Diastolic hypertension
predominates before age 50, either alone or in combination with SBP elevation. The
prevalence of systolic hypertension increases with age, and above 50 years of age,
systolic hypertension represents the most common form of hypertension. DBP is a
more potent cardiovascular risk factor than SBP until age 50; thereafter, SBP is more
important.10
1.2 Isolated Office (“White-Coat”) Hypertension
Isolated office hypertension is characterised by an elevation in clinic blood pressure
but normal home or ambulatory blood-pressure values. In these subjects the clinic
BP is persistently above 140/90 mmHg but the home or daytime ambulatory systolic/
diastolic BP measurements are lower than 135/85 mmHg.
1.3 Masked Hypertension
Patients with masked hypertension have normal clinic blood pressure but elevated
daytime ambulatory or home blood-pressure level (≥135/85 mmHg). Prognosis of
masked hypertension is worse than isolated office hypertension.12
For both isolated office and masked hypertension, once diagnosed, initial therapeutic
interventions should be non-pharmacological and aim for adoption of healthy living.
However, drug treatment is indicated, particularly when the patient’s cardiovascular risk
profile is elevated or when target-organ damage (TOD) is detected.12 (Refer to chapter
3 on Diagnosis and Initial Assessment).
SUMMARY
RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Blood pressure should be measured under standardised condition (see section 2.1).
It can be measured directly or indirectly. There are four common devices used for the
indirect measurement of BP namely:
• electronic devices
• aneroid sphygmomanometer
• automated ambulatory BP devices
• mercury column sphygmomanometer
The mercury sphygmomanometer remains the gold standard for non-invasive
measurement.13(Level III) However, it is largely being replaced by the electronic blood
pressure measurement devices due to environmental and health concerns.14
There are many calibrated electronic or ambulatory BP devices available in the market.
Only models validated by professional bodies (www.bhsoc.org, www.aami.org) should
be used.
An appropriate cuff size should be used. Both the length and width of the inflatable
bladder are important. The bladder length should encircle at least 80% of the
circumference whilst the width should be at least 40% of the circumference of the arm.
The standard cuff size should be 13 cm x 24 cm. Too small a cuff size will give a falsely
high reading. Too big a cuff will give a falsely low reading.
Blood Pressure should be measured in both arms on the first visit and the higher
reading is taken as the systolic BP.13 Patient should be rested at least 1 minute before
measurement. At least 2 readings preferably 1-2 minutes apart should be taken in the
same arm with the patient in the same position. A third reading should be taken if
the difference between the first two readings is greater than 10 mmHg. The last two
readings should be averaged. In the elderly, BP should be taken sitting & standing.
Blood pressure measurements should not be done on the arm with arterio-venous
fistula in haemodialysis patients.
If the difference in BP between the two arms is >20/10 mmHg, further evaluation is
required to look for the cause. If patients are at high risk of postural hypotension, blood
pressure should be taken lying and one minute after standing.
Measurement of Blood Pressure

30
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 2. Measurement of Blood Pressure
A systolic drop of >20 mmHg after one minute of standing is considered a significant
postural drop.13
2.1 Electronic BP Sets
As mentioned earlier, electronic BP sets are now preferred.
A technical committee assessment by MOH concluded that if electronic BP set is used,
it must be confirmed by mercury Sphymomanometer in patients with cardiac illness,
artherosclerosis, renal disease and in children. (Digital Blood Pressure Measurement
sets, Health Technology Assessment Section, Medical division, Ministry of Health
Malaysia. 014-2017 available at http://www.moh.gov.my.)
These electronic machines are generally less accurate in patients with arrhythmias (e.g.
atrial fibrillation).
2.2 Home BP Measurement (HBPM) Using Electronic Devices
Home BP measurement is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis and management of
hypertension especially in selected patients. If properly performed, it has good
prognostic value.15,16 (Level II-2)
Systematic reviews have shown that HBPM is superior compared to office measurements
in diagnosing hypertension, in uncontrolled hypertension, assessing antihypertensive
treatment, improving patient’s adherence (compliance) and provides potential cost
saving.17 (Level I),18-20
Additionally, some studies have shown that HBPM measurements can be an alternative
to ABPM and may have similar prognostic value.21,22(Level I) Home devices that measure the
blood pressure in the fingers or the wrists are not recommended.
Situations where HBPM is useful include:23
• at initial assessment
• to diagnose hypertension
• to diagnose isolated office hypertension
• to diagnose masked hypertension
• to assess treatment effects
• to diagnose true resistant hypertension
• to encourage adherence to treatment
• to optimise blood pressure control
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 2. Measurement of Blood Pressure
RECOMMENDATIONS
BP Measuring Technique
For Clinic BP, patients should:
• refrain from smoking, eating, caffeine intake or exercise for at least 30
minutes
• be seated for at least 1 min in a quiet room, back & arm supported (e.g.
resting on the table)
• be seated with legs uncrossed, not talking and relaxed
• use the correct bladder cuff size placed at heart level
For home measurements, besides the above:
• a minimum measurement for 3 days (ideally 7 days) should be performed
• should be done at about the same time once in the morning (before drug intake if
on treatment) and evening (before meal)
• two readings should be taken at each occasion (at least 1 minute apart)
• the readings must be immediately recorded in a specific logbook or stored in a
device with memory
The following must be taken into consideration when interpreting HBPM:23
• BP values measured on the first monitoring day should be disregarded
• Average the remaining BP measurements (at least 3 days)
• Mean home systolic BP >135 mmHg and/or diastolic BP >85 mmHg should be
considered as elevated
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 2. Measurement of Blood Pressure
2.3 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)
Most of the data upon which estimates of risk are based, as well as benefits of treatment
have been accumulated from office BP readings and therefore ABPM is not essential for
the diagnosis and management of most patients with hypertension.
The data provided by ABPM does not influence therapeutic decisions in the vast
majority of patients. The current cost of ABPM devices will also limit its widespread use.
ABPM is useful in selected clinical situations. These include:24,25 (Level III)
• diagnosis of isolated office hypertension
• diagnosis of masked hypertension
• patients with borderline or labile hypertension
• detection of nocturnal hypertension
• evaluation of suspected hypotensive symptoms, especially in the elderly
• fluctuating office BP readings
• confirmation of resistant hypertension
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Evaluation of patients with documented hypertension has three objectives:
1. To exclude secondary causes of hypertension. (Table 3-A)
2. To ascertain the presence of target organ damage or complication. (Table 3-B)
3. To assess lifestyle and identify other cardiovascular risk factors (Table 3-C) or
coexisting condition that affect prognosis and guide treatment. (Table 3-D)

Chapter 3. Diagnosis and Initial Assessment
According to a study in Malaysia as many as 54% patients with essential hypertension
did not have their cardiovascular risks adequately assessed.27
Following initial clinical evaluation and investigations, the patient should be risk
stratified. Many patients with hypertension have more than one other cardiovascular
Physical examination should include the following:
• General examination including height, weight and waist circumference
• Measure BP appropriately. (refer to Chapter 2)
• Fundus examination
• Examination for carotid bruit, abdominal bruit, presence of peripheral pulses and
radio-femoral delay
• Cardiac examination for cardiomegaly, signs of heart failure and aortic
regurgitation
• Abdominal examination for renal masses/bruit and aortic aneurysm
• Neurological examination to look for evidence of stroke
• Signs of endocrine disorders (e.g. Cushing syndrome, acromegaly and thyroid
disease)
• Ankle brachial index (if available)
The minimum initial investigations aim to screen for presence of secondary causes of
hypertension, determine the presence of CV risk factors, target organ damage (TOD)
and target organ complication (TOC). They should include the following:26(Level III)
• Full blood count
• Blood glucose
• Renal function tests (creatinine, eGFR, serum electrolytes)
• Lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides)
• Uric acid
• Urinalysis (dip stick: albuminuria/microalbuminuria & microscopic haematuria)
• Electrocardiogram (ECG)
If the examination or investigations suggest the presence of a secondary causes, the
patient should be referred for specialist evaluation. If there is evidence of TOD or TOC
(Table 3-B), further tests should be considered.
• Diabetes mellitus
• Dyslipidaemia
• Cigarette smoking
• Microalbuminuria/Proteinuria
• Estimated GFR <60 mL/min/m2

risk factor. Each additional risk factor increases cardiovascular risk substantially. Hence,
overall global cardiovascular risk of a patient with hypertension should be done.28,29
There are various ways to assess global cardiovascular risk and this includes using
validated risk charts like the Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Chart which has
been validated locally and found to perform quite well30,31 or using risk stratification
tables (Table 3-D) which stratifies the risk of developing major cardiovascular events,
which includes stroke, myocardial infarction and total mortality.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Non-pharmacological management (healthy living) plays an important role in the
management of hypertension and in improving overall cardiovascular health.33-35 When
recommending healthy living, it is important to know that these interventions require a
joint effort from patient, family and healthcare providers.
4.1 Weight Reduction
Dietary interventions to lower body weight are often recommended for overweight
people with mild hypertension. In people with hypertension, weight reducing diet has
been shown to reduce blood pressure and body weight.36 A 4kg reduction in body
weight would achieve a BP reduction of 4.5/3.2 mmHg. There is evidence that showed
a reduction of 1kg in weight relates to 1 mmHg reduction in SBP.37 However, the long
term effect of weight loss on mortality and morbidity in people with hypertension is
unknown.36,37
4.2 Sodium Intake
High salt intake is associated with increased risk of stroke, stroke mortality, and coronary
heart disease mortality.38,39 Reducing sodium intake significantly reduces blood pressure
in adults.38-41 WHO recommends a reduction of sodium intake to <2 g/day or <5 g/day
of salt (about one teaspoon of salt) in adults.42 A recent Cochrane review has shown
that a reduction of sodium intake from a high average of 201 mmol/day (11.6g of salt)
to an average level of 66 mmol/day (3.8g of salt), resulted in a decrease in BP of 7.8/2.7
mmHg in Asian people with hypertension.40 However there is inadequate evidence
assessing the effect of reduced sodium intake on cardiovascular disease mortality and
morbidity.38,39,43-45 In Malaysia, the estimated mean sodium excretion of normotensive
people was 3.4 to 3.8 g, equivalent to 8.7 to 9.5 g of salt intake per day.46,47 This exceeds
the recommended salt intake and hence salt reduction is recommended for most
people especially the hypertensive population.48
Non-Pharmacological Management
4
39
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 4. Non-Pharmacological Management
4.3 Alcohol Consumption
Alcohol consumption elevates BP. Previous meta-analysis has shown that reducing
alcohol consumption reduced BP by 3.3/2 mmHg.49(Level I) A recent meta-analysis has
shown that reducing alcohol intake lowers BP in a dose-dependent manner with an
apparent threshold.50(Level I) People who drink are advised to limit alcohol consumption
to < two drinks per day.50(Level I)
4.4 Regular Physical Activity
Increased physical activity has been shown to reduce BP. However, there is a lack of
data on its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality.51 Meta-analyses have shown
that dynamic aerobic endurance,52-53 dynamic resistance,54 and isometric resistance
training55-57 lower BP. All patients with hypertension benefit from any form of these
physical activities.58 Cumulative moderate intensity aerobic exercise of at least 150
minutes per week is advised.59,60
4.5 Healthy Eating
A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low fat dairy products with reduced saturated and
total fat can substantially lower BP (11/6 mmHg in hypertensive patients and 4/2 mmHg
in patients with high normal BP).60(Level I) A recent meta-analysis suggests that healthy
dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Nordic,
and Mediterranean diet significantly lowered BP by 4.26/2.38 mmHg.61 These diets are
rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, fish and dairy products
and low in meat, sweets, and alcohol. A recent cohort study that included Malaysian
population without cardiovascular disease has shown that higher fruit, vegetable, and
legume consumption was associated with a lower risk of non-cardiovascular and total
mortality.62
4.6 Cessation of Smoking
Smoking can raise BP acutely. However the effect of chronic smoking on BP is less clear.
Nevertheless smoking cessation is important in reducing global cardiovascular risk.
4.7 Relaxation Therapy
Stress management is useful but evidence on relaxation interventions on BP reduction
has not been convincing.60,63 Yoga had been shown in a systematic review to reduce
blood pressure by 4.2/3.6 mmHg but the quality of evidence is poor.64
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 4. Non-Pharmacological Management
4.8 Dietary Potassium Intake
A meta-analysis has shown that increased dietary potassium intake reduces BP in adults
with hypertension without adverse effect on blood lipid concentrations, catecholamine
concentrations, or renal function.65 For adults with normal renal function and not at risk
of hyperkalaemia, increasing dietary potassium can reduce BP by 3.49/1.96 mmHg.65
Higher dietary potassium intake was associated with a 24% lower risk of stroke.65 This
can be achieved by eating fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes.
4.9 Others
Evidence for beneficial effect of micronutrient alterations, caffeine reduction and
dietary supplementation with fish oil, calcium, magnesium, garlic and fibre on BP is
limited.34,35,66-73 Meta-analyses have suggested that regular consumption of black tea
and green tea can reduce BP but the sample size was small and quality of studies
varied.74,75(Level 1)
• Healthy Living must be instituted as an integral part in managing
hypertension. (Grade A)
• Reduce salt intake, do regular physical activity, limit alcohol intake to < 2
drinks per day for those who drink, increase dietary potassium and lose
weight to reduce BP. (Grade A)
RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
5.1a Initiating Treatment
For patients with Stage I (mild) hypertension with low cardiovascular risk, advice
should be given on healthy living for a period of three to six months. Pharmacological
treatment has not been shown to prevent cardiovascular outcome in this group
of patients.77,78 Patients should be seen at least twice (ideally monthly) during this
period to assess the efficacy of the non-pharmacological intervention. Stage I
patients with medium or higher risk79-84 should be offered drug treatment upon
diagnosis (Figure 5-A).(Level I)
5.1b Choosing Antihypertensive Drug Treatment
In patients with newly diagnosed uncomplicated hypertension and no compelling
indications, choice of first line monotherapy includes ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs and
diuretics which have all been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.85-89(Level I) Beta-blockers are not recommended as first line monotherapy in
this group of patients according to some guidelines.4(Level III),90,91 This was based on
an earlier meta-analysis which showed that it is not as effective in lowering blood
pressure and in the prevention of stroke compared to the other anti-hypertensive
agents.92-95 However more recent meta-analyses including updated versions
of earlier meta-analyses95,99(Level I) and an analysis100 have suggested ß-blockers
(especially ß1 selective) can be given as first line agent. Other guidelines continue to
recommend ß-blockers as first line agent even in uncomplicated newly diagnosed
hypertension.26,101,102 However, almost all guidelines recommend that ß-blockers
should be considered in younger patients in particular:
• those with an intolerance or contraindication to ACEIs and ARBs or
• women of child-bearing potential or
• patients with evidence of increased sympathetic drive.
5.1 General Guidelines
All patients must be risk stratified to guide management. Decision to initiate
pharmacologic treatment depends on the global cardiovascular risk (Table 3-D). It
is the reduction of BP which provides the main benefits in the general hypertensive
population.76 (Level I) The choice of drug should be individualised.
Pharmacological Management
5
42
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 5. Pharmacological Management
Ideally, individualisation should be based on scientific evidence of reduction in
clinical outcomes and co-morbidities (Table 5-C). Contraindications to the use of
these drugs must also be considered.
In patients with stage I hypertension, treatment should be started with monotherapy
at low dose. Monotherapy can lower BP to <140/90 mmHg in approximately 20–
50% of patients with mild to moderate hypertension103 If after a sufficient period of
treatment (up to six weeks) with monotherapy BP is still not controlled, three options
are available;
• the dose of the initial drug can be increased
• the drug can be substituted with another class of drug
• a second drug can be added
Choices of combination therapy is as shown in Table 5-A & 5-B.
If target BP is not achieved despite showing some blood pressure lowering effect
with monotherapy, either increase the dose of the initial anti-hypertensive agent or
add a second anti-hypertensive. The former may however give rise to dose-related
adverse effects. Properly selected antihypertensive combinations may also mitigate
the adverse effects of each other. If the patient does not show response or does not
tolerate the initial drug, substituting with a drug from another class is recommended.
(Level III) In patients presenting with stage II hypertension or beyond, combination
therapy as first line is recommended.(Level III) (Refer to Figure 5-A). Combination
therapy can be considered as first line in high risk stage 1 hypertension especially
for secondary prevention 83,84 (Level 1)
Single Pill Combinations (SPC) is very convenient to use and promote treatment
adherence by reducing pill burden and simplifying the treatment regimen.104,105,106
(Level 1) In addition, it takes less time to achieve BP control using a combination than
monotherapy.107,108,109 (Level I)
It should be emphasized that simplification of the treatment regimen using SPC is
only one strategy for improving adherence. For many patients, cost is a critical issue.
In Malaysia, generic SPC are generally not available. Patented SPC are available but
are more expensive. This may adversely affect adherence especially for self-paying
patients. Free drug combination is the obvious choice in such circumstances. It is
however worth emphasizing that available evidence showed SPC is associated with
not only improved adherence, but also lower overall healthcare cost.110(LevelII-2)
It is important to be reminded that the beneficial effects of BP lowering with
pharmacotherapy is demonstrated from medium to very high CV risk. The absolute
benefit in terms of CV event reduction is greater the higher baseline risk.111 (Level 1)

Chapter 5. Pharmacological Management
5.1c Target Blood Pressure
Efforts must be made to achieve target BP. For patients <80 years old, the target
SBP should be <140 mmHg and DBP <90 mmHg.88,100 For patients aged 80 years and
above, aim for a target of <150/90 mmHg115 (Refer to chapter 7.5 on Hypertension
in Older Adults). For high/very high risk individuals the target is <130/80 mmHg116,117
(Refer to chapter 7 on Hypertension in Special Groups).
If BP is still >140/90 mmHg with three drugs, including a diuretic at optimal tolerated
doses, there is a need to exclude medication non-adherence and isolated office
hypertension. After excluding these causes of uncontrolled hypertension, the patient
is then defined as having resistant hypertension118 (Refer to chapter 10 on Resistant
Hypertension). A quick check on the possible causes of resistant hypertension is
required. These include:
• secondary hypertension
• excessive sodium intake, excessive liquorice intake, drugs and drug
interactions. (see chapter 4 Non-pharmacological Management)
• complications of long standing hypertension such as nephrosclerosis, loss of
aortic distensibility and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis
5.2 Follow–Up Visits
Follow up intervals should be individualised based on global CV risk, pre-treatment BP
levels and drugs used. For high and very high risk patients, it is advisable to bring the
BP to target within 3 to 6 months.82 Once target BP is achieved, follow-up at three to
six-month intervals is appropriate. As a rule, once the BP is controlled, most patients
will require life-long treatment. Patients must be counseled to have at least six monthly
follow ups even though the BP is well controlled and not to resort to merely going for
repeat prescription without seeing a doctor. During these visits, doctors should assess
persistence of BP control, adverse reaction to treatment, global vascular risk (including
new onset and pre-existing CV risk factors) and complications of hypertension with may
have developed since the last visit.
5.3 When To Refer
Most patients can be effectively managed by primary care practitioners. Patients with
the following conditions should be referred to the appropriate specialists including
Family Medicine Specialists for further assessment. Indications for referral to the
appropriate specialists include:
• severe hypertension (>180/110 mmHg) - refer to chapter 6 on Management of
Severe Hypertension
• suspected secondary hypertension
• resistant and refractory hypertension
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 5. Pharmacological Management
RECOMMENDATIONS
• recent onset target organ damage
• pregnancy
• office hypertension with additional CV risk
• children and adults <30 years
• secondary prevention with multiple co-morbidities/risk factors
5.4 Step-Down Therapy
Step-down therapy is discouraged in the vast majority of patients. However in patients
who insist on it, the following criteria must be considered first:
• Patients’ BP must not be higher than stage I (mild) hypertension with low global
CV risk
• BP well-controlled for at least 1 year on the same medication at the same dosage
• Must agree to be followed-up at least 3-6 monthly
• Must be motivated to adopt healthy living
A recent systematic review supports this recommendation.119 This review of studies done
between 1975 to 2013 showed that a trial of treatment withdrawal in well controlled
hypertensives followed by subsequent regular blood pressure monitoring is safe with
minor adverse events. Predictors of successful withdrawals were patients on prior
monotherapy and lower blood pressures before withdrawal.
• Treat most patients with pharmacological agent life-long. (Grade C)
• Choose mono-therapy in patients with stage 1 hypertension and with no
compelling indication from one of the 5 classes of drug of agents (ACEIs,
ARBs, CCBs, Diuretics or ß-Blockers) based on patient’s individual clinical
profile. (Grade C)
• Choose combination therapy in patients with medium/high/very high risk
stage 1 hypertension and stage 2 hypertension. (Grade A)
• Treat BP to SBP<140 mmHg and DBP<90 mmHg for most hypertensive
patients. (Grade A)
• Treat SBP to <130mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg for high/very high risk
patients. (Grade A)
• Use combination therapy (free or single pill) for most patients to achieve BP
control. (Grade A)
• Arrange periodic scheduled visits to assess global CV risk, emerging new
risk factors and organ damage/complication. (Grade C)
• Co-manage patients whose BP are controlled with primary care facilities
(Klinik Kesihatan or private general practice). (Grade C)

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Severe hypertension is defined as persistent elevated SBP >180 mmHg and/or DBP
>110 mmHg.
These patients may present with:
• incidental finding in an asymptomatic non-previously diagnosed patient
• treated hypertension on follow-up who are asymptomatic
• patients with symptoms which may include:
»» non-specific symptoms like headache, dizziness, lethargy
»» symptoms and signs of acute target organ damage/complication. These include
acute heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, acute renal failure, dissecting
aneurysm, subarachnoid haemorrhage, hypertensive encephalopathy and
preeclampsia/eclampsia (Refer to chapter 7.4 Hypertension and Stroke, chapter
7.6 Hypertension in Women)
Patients are then categorised as having:
a. hypertensive urgencies (urgency), or
b. hypertensive emergencies (emergency)
(a) and (b) are also referred to as hypertensive crises.
In a recent large series, only a minority of patients admitted (5.1%) had hypertensive
crises. Of those, more than three quarters (76.6%) constitute hypertensive
emergencies.120(Level II)
Management of these patients depends on the clinical presentation and laboratory
investigations. The evaluation of these patients should include a thorough history and
physical examination, particularly looking for signs of acute target organ damage/
complication and causes of secondary hypertension. (Table 6-A)
The commonest reason of severe hypertension is long-standing poorly controlled
essential hypertension. Other causes are as listed in Table 6-A.

Chapter 6. Management of Severe Hypertension
6.1 Specific Management
The aim of management is to reduce BP in a controlled, predictable and safe manner, to
avoid provoking or aggravating acute coronary syndrome, cerebral or renal ischaemia.
6.1.1 Hypertensive Urgency
Hypertensive urgency is defined as severe increase in BP which is not associated
with acute end organ damage/complication and these include patients with grade
III or IV retinal changes (also known as accelerated and malignant hypertension), but
no overt symptoms and signs of acute target organ damage/complication. These
patients may be admitted.
Blood pressure measurement should be repeated after 30 minutes of bed
rest.121,122(Level II) Initial treatment should aim for about 25% reduction in BP over
24 hours but not lower than 160/100 mmHg.123,124(Level II) Oral drugs proven to be
effective are outlined in Table 6-B. Combination therapy may be necessary.
Importantly, there is no role for intravenous BP lowering drugs. Many of these
patients have withdrawn from or are not adhering to antihypertensive therapy
and do not have clinical or laboratory evidence of acute target organ damage.125
Possible precipitating factors for hypertensive urgency include non-adherence to

6.1.2 Hypertensive Emergency
Hypertensive emergency is defined as severe elevation of blood pressure associated
with new or progressive end organ damage/complication such as acute heart failure,
dissecting aneurysm, acute coronary syndromes, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute
renal failure, subarachnoid haemorrhage and/or intracranial haemorrhage. These may
occur in patients with BP <180/110 mmHg, particularly if the BP has risen rapidly.
These patients:
• should be admitted for immediate intervention and monitoring.
• need to be reduce their BP rapidly based on clinical scenarios - refer also to
chapter 7.4 Hypertension and Stroke, and chapter 7.6 Hypertension in Women.
• should have their BP reduced by 10%-25% within certain minutes to hours but
not lower than 160/90 mmHg.128,129(Level III)
This is best achieved with parenteral drugs. (Table 6-D)

in 30 to 60 minutes, if the
patient is clinically stable,
further gradual reductions
toward a normal BP can
be implemented over the

There has been very few head to head comparative trials on the management of
hypertensive crises especially hypertensive emergencies. A recent meta-analysis
showed that IV labetalol have comparable efficacy and safety compared to nicardipine
with the later showing more predictable and consistent BP control.133,134 (Level 1)
Specific clinical scenarios requiring rapid lowering of SBP, usually to at least <140
mmHg, in the first hour of treatment include aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia or
eclampsia, and pheochromocytoma with hypertensive crisis.1,131
In summary, the selection of an antihypertensive agent should be based on the drug’s
pharmacology, pathophysiological factors underlying the patient’s hypertension,
degree of progression of target organ damage, the desirable rate of BP decline,
and the presence of comorbidities. The therapeutic goal is to minimise target organ
damage safely by rapid recognition of the problem and early initiation of appropriate
antihypertensive treatment.1,129

6.2 Dangers of Rapid Reduction in Blood Pressure
Rapid reduction of BP (within minutes to hours) in hypertensive urgencies should be
avoided as it may precipitate ischaemic events.136
Oral or sublingual drugs with rapid onset of action can result in an uncontrolled BP
reduction. Several serious side effects have been reported with the administration of
sublingual fast-acting nifedipine and therefore this is no longer recommended.137(Level III)
However oral nifedipine retard can be used and has been recommended as first line
therapy for hypertensive urgencies.124(Level III)
Following stabilisation of patient’s BP, subsequent management is tailored towards
achieving optimal control.
For management of patients with severe hypertension and stroke, refer to chapter 7.4
Hypertension and Stroke.
• In hypertensive urgencies, aim for 10-20 mmHg SBP reduction after 2 hours
of rest. Failing this, pharmacotherapy should be initiated. (Grade B)
• Treat hypertensive urgencies with combination oral therapy targeting BP to
reduce by around 25% within 24 hours. (Grade C)
• Treat hypertensive emergencies with intravenous drugs with specific targets
based upon clinical scenarios. (Grade B)
• Reduce SBP to less than 140 mmHg during the first hour for patients with
severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, and pheochromocytoma crisis. For
patients with aortic dissection reduce SBP to less than 120 mmHg. (Grade C)
• Reduce SBP by no more than 25% within the first hour; then, if stable, to
160/100 mmHg within the next 2 to 6 hours; and then cautiously to normal
during the following 24 to 48 hours in all other situations. (Grade C)
RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
7.1 Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus
From the Malaysian National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015, the prevalence
of diabetes in those 18 years and above was 17.5%, and in the 18-19 years age group the
prevalence was 5.5%, indicating that diabetics in Malaysia are generally younger.
Hypertension is common in patients with diabetes mellitus. Its presence increases the
risk of morbidity and mortality. In 2016 the prevalence of hypertension in Malaysian
diabetics was 76%.138 Hypertension should be treated early in diabetes to prevent both
microvascular and macrovascular complications and CV death.
7.1.1 Threshold for Treatment
Pharmacological treatment should be initiated in patients with diabetes when the BP
is persistently ≥140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic.
The presence of microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria should be treated even if the BP
is <140/90 mmHg. An ACEI or ARB is preferred.139-147 (Level I) In a proportion of patients,
microalbuminuria may be normalised by high doses of ACEIs143 (Level 1) or ARBs144,145 (Level I)
even if the BP is already optimally controlled. Normalisation of microalbuminuria is
associated with a reduction in the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate.148
7.1.2 Target Blood Pressure
Tight BP control should take precedence over the class of anti-hypertensive drug
used.149,150 (Level I) This will often require combination therapy.
Prior to the ACCORD study, it was generally accepted that for diabetics, the lower
the BP the better the outcomes. However, in the ACCORD Study, diabetic patients
at high risk of cardiovascular events who were randomised to a target systolic blood
pressure (SBP) of <120 mmHg, did not show a reduction in the composite outcome of
CV death, myocardial infarct and stroke, as compared with <140 mmHg.151 (Level I) This
could possibly be due to the J-curve phenomenon seen in this particular cohort of
patients who had underlying cardiovascular disease at baseline. This is supported by
a more recent population based analysis.152
Hypertension in Special Groups

61
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
In diabetics with CKD, the recommended target BP is <130/80 mmHg.
Other reports153,154 emphasise that major trials like ACCORD incorporate elderly
patients (mean age 62 years) with established CVD or with multiple CV risk factors.
These trials may not be relevant to younger diabetics with few or no risk factors, in
whom continued benefits are derived from lowering the SBP to below 140 mmHg. In
Malaysia, diabetics are younger and more aggressive BP targets may confer greater
benefits.
The targets recommended by Malaysian CPG have been consistent over the years;
and the studies above confirm that generally the target BP should be aimed at
<140/80 mmHg,83,155 with a target of <130/80 mmHg in younger patients and those
at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.139,155,156 However, in diabetics with established
CAD further lowering of the BP beyond 120/80 mmHg does not confer additional
cardiovascular benefit.
7.1.3 Management
The management of the hypertensive diabetic will involve healthy living changes as
well as drug treatment.
7.1.4 Principles of Pharmacological Management
The use of certain classes of anti-hypertensive drugs may be detrimental to the
diabetic patient because of their modes of action or adverse effects. Diabetes control
may be compromised and diabetic complications aggravated, for example:
• decreased insulin responsiveness with higher doses of diuretics
• masking of the early symptoms of hypoglycaemia with ß-blockers and slower
recovery from hypoglycaemia with non-selective ß-blockers
• aggravation of the symptoms of peripheral vascular disease with ß-blockers
• dyslipidaemia with most ß-blockers and diuretics
• worsening of orthostatic hypotension with peripheral ∂-blockers or centrally
acting drugs
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are the drugs of choice based on
extensive data attesting to their cardiovascular benefits and reno-protective effects
in patients with diabetic kidney disease.157 (Level I) They have also been reported to
prevent the onset of nephropathy in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients with or
without hypertension.155,158,159 (Level II) In addition they do not have adverse effects
on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. However, its routine use in normotensive
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
normoalbuminuric diabetic patients is currently not recommended. If an ACEI is not
tolerated, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be considered.
For type 1 diabetes with nephropathy, ACEIs are the recommended agent.140 For type
2 diabetes, both the ACEIs & ARBs may be used.
Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics can be added on when monotherapy is inadequate.
Single Pill Combination of a thiazide-like diuretic (indapamide) with perindopril has
been reported to reduce overall mortality.83(Level I)
CCBs do not have significant adverse metabolic effects. They do not compromise
glycaemic control in diabetic patients. They can be effectively combined with a
RAS blocker to lower blood pressure in hypertensive diabetics. The combination
of benazepril with amlodipine was superior to the combination of benazepril with
hydrocholothiazide, leading to a reduction of cardiovascular events in the overall
study population as well as the diabetic subgroup.84(Level 1)
Beta-blockers may be used when ACEIs, ARBs or CCBs cannot be used or when there
are concomitant compelling indications. However, they should be used with caution,
especially in patients with type 1 diabetes.160(Level III)
The SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of oral anti-diabetic agents. In addition to
lowering blood sugar levels, they lower the BP modestly but consistently.161 However,
the mechanism by which BP is lowered is unknown. In the EMPA-REG trial162(Level 1) and
the CANVAS Program,163(Level 1) the SBP was lowered by a mean of 5.0 and 3.9 mmHg
respectively. In the two trials, the composite endpoints of CV death, myocardial
infarct and strokes was also reduced. The reduction in the composite endpoints may
however, not be related to BP reduction and the underlying mechanism in improving
CV outcome is also unknown.
• Initiate ACEIs in diabetes without proteinuria. Use ARB for ACEI
intolerant patients. (Grade A)
• Initiate ACEIs or ARBs in patients with diabetes and proteinuria. (Grade A)
• Consider CCBs, diuretics or ß-blockers if RAS blockers cannot be used.
(Grade B)

Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.2.1 Hypertension and Non-Diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease
Hypertension may be a cause or consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).164,165
CKD is one of the commonest causes of secondary hypertension. Hypertension
in CKD is often associated with an elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria and/or
haematuria. The prevalence of hypertension increases with increasing levels of renal
impairment, and approximately 50-75% of individuals with GFR <60 ml/ min/1.73m2
(CKD stages 3–5) have hypertension.166 Hypertension accelerates the progression of
CKD and may lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, CKD is associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There are proven benefits of
blood pressure lowering for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with
moderately reduced kidney function167 as well as those on dialysis.168,169(Level 1)
Tight control of BP in patients with CKD is therefore important. BP goals depend on
urinary protein excretion. The target BP should be <140/90 mmHg for patients with
CKD170-172 (Level I) and <130/80 mmHg for those with proteinuria ≥1g/24hours.173(Level I)
Where well tolerated, aiming towards an Automated Office Systolic BP of 120mmHg
in patients aged >50 years with nondiabetic nephropathy, GFR>20 ml/min/1.73m2
and proteinuria <1g/day has shown cardiovascular benefits.174,175(Level II-2) When
aiming towards <120 mmHg systolic, close monitoring is recommended to detect
treatment-related adverse effects including hypotension, syncope, electrolyte
abnormalities and acute kidney injury.175 All anti-hypertensive drug classes can be
used to achieve this goal.167
In the management of hypertension in CKD, control of BP and proteinuria are the
most important factors in terms of retarding CKD progression. Anti-hypertensive
agents that reduce proteinuria have an advantage in patients with nondiabetic
proteinuric nephropathy. Meta analyses of comparative trials concluded that
ACEI conferred an anti-proteinuric effect greater than other anti-hypertensive
drugs.176(Level 1) Overall 30% reduction in incidence of ESRD with ACEI can be
expected.177 The anti-proteinuric effect and reduction in ESRD was beyond that
attributable to the BP lowering effect.172,178(Level I) This anti-proteinuric effect of ACEI
was most prominent in patients on a low sodium diet or those treated with diuretics.
Patients with proteinuria >3g/24 hours benefit the most.172,178 The advantage of ACEI
is most apparent in patients with rapid progression of renal disease associated with
proteinuria. ARBs are similar to ACEI in lowering BP and reducing proteinuria.
Combined RAS blockade can reduce proteinuria more than monotherapy.179
However this is associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, hypotension and
renal failure.180(Level 1) Hence, this approach is not recommended in patients with CKD.
Renal insufficiency should not be a contraindication to starting ACEI or ARB therapy,
nor should it be a reason for discontinuing therapy. Serum creatinine level should
be checked within the first two weeks of initiation of therapy and also after every
increase in dose. If there is a persistent rise (at least 2 occasions) of serum creatinine
7.2 Hypertension and Renal Diseases
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
of >30% from baseline within two months, ACEIs181(Level II-3) or ARBs should be reduced
or stopped after excluding other precipitating factors. These patients should be
referred to a nephrologist or physician.
In patients with GFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2, thiazide diuretics may not be effective
antihypertensive agents and therefore loop diuretics are preferred.182(Level III)
Concurrent diuretic therapy will often be necessary in patients with renal insufficiency
since salt and water retention is an important determinant of hypertension in this
setting.
Calcium channel blockers may be used in renal disease. In those with proteinuria, the
non-dihydropyridine group of CCBs namely diltiazem or verapamil are preferred, as
they have an additional anti-proteinuric effect.176(Level I) Dihydropyridine CCBs can be
considered if optimal BP is not achieved but should not be used as monotherapy in
patients with proteinuria. The combination of an ACEI and a non-dihydropyridine
CCB is more antiproteinuric than either drug alone.183(Level II-2)
• BP goals depend on urinary protein excretion.
• Anti-hypertensive agents that reduce proteinuria have an advantage in
patients with nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathy.
• ACEI and ARBs confer an anti-proteinuric effect greater than other antihypertensive drugs.
• Patients with proteinuria of <1g/24 hours, lower BP to <140/90 mmHg.
(Grade A)
• In patients with proteinuria of >1g/24 hours, lower BP to <130/80 mmHg.
(Grade A)
• In patient >50 years, GFR >20 ml/min/1.73m2 and proteinuria <1g/day
lower SBP <120 mmHg using Automated Self-measured Office BP to
reduce cardiovascular event. (Grade B)
• Choose RAS blockers as initial antihypertensive therapy for patients with
micro- or macroalbuminuria. (Grade A)
• Consider concurrent diuretic therapy and dietary salt restriction as salt
and water retention are important determinants of hypertension in CKD.
• Add non-dihydropyridine CCBs if BP goal is still not achieved and there is
persistent proteinuria. (Grade A)
• Avoid dual RAS blockade in patients with CKD. (Grade A)

7.2.2 Renovascular Hypertension
Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is defined as a rise in arterial pressure attributable
to reduced perfusion of the kidney(s).184 It is important to diagnose renovascular
hypertension as it is potentially reversible. Treatment also has the potential to restore
or preserve renal function. The aetiology of renovascular hypertension includes the
following:
• Atherosclerotic renovascular disease
• Fibromuscular dysplasia
• Takayasu’s arteritis
• Transplant renal artery stenosis
Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is an important cause as it can lead to
ESRD.185 It is also associated with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease
and peripheral vascular disease. In patients with ARAS older than 60 years, the five-
year-survival is 45% in patients with bilateral ARAS and 18% in those requiring dialysis
therapy.186
The presence of a stenotic renal vessel in a patient with hypertension does not
necessarily equate to RVH. Some clinical features suggestive of RVH include:
• onset of hypertension before 30 years, especially without family history
• recent onset of hypertension after 55 years or deterioration in BP control in a
previously well-controlled patient
• resistant hypertension
• abdominal bruit; particularly if associated with a unilateral small kidney
• flash pulmonary oedema
• renal failure of uncertain cause in the presence of normal urine sediment
• renal failure induced by ACEIs or ARBs
• coexisting diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease
Renal angiography including measurement of the pressure gradient remains the gold
standard in the diagnosis of RVH.187 Non-invasive investigations include doppler
sonography, captopril-enhanced isotope scan, spiral CT angiography (CTA), and
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in patients with normal renal function.188
All patients with ARAS require intensive medical therapy. ACEIs or ARBs are
recommended to control blood pressure and reduce clinical events in those with
known cardiovascular disease. Medical treatment includes statins, low dose aspirin,
cessation of smoking and management of diabetes when present. This approach can
be considered for patients with stenosis less than 70% or those with stable renal
function and good BP control despite radiological evidence of stenosis >70%. These
lesions should be monitored for progression using colour duplex sonography and the
renal function of patients must be carefully monitored. A persistent rise in creatinine
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
of >30% over 2 months warrants cessation of ACEI/ARB drug therapy. This is best
done under specialist’s supervision.
If revascularisation is required, it is usually achieved by percutaneous angioplasty
with stenting or surgical revascularisation in patents with complex anatomic lesions.
Revascularisation should be considered under the following circumstances:188
• A short duration of blood pressure elevation prior to the diagnosis of RVH
• Recurrent flash pulmonary oedema or refractory heart failure
• Resistant hypertension
• Intolerance to optimal medical therapy e.g. deterioration of renal function
during antihypertensive therapy
• Otherwise unexplained progressive deterioration in renal function
Where indications for revascularisation are uncertain, 3 prospective randomised
trials have not demonstrated compelling benefits either with endovascular stents or
surgery when added to effective medical therapy.189-191(Level 1)
Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) rarely have excretory dysfunction, and
hypertension in these patients generally responds to ACEIs.192(Level II-2) Given the typical
patient with FMD (young female with lower angioplasty-related risks, the need for
many years of anti-hypertensive treatment plus limitations of RAS blockers during
pregnancy), most clinicians would probably favour angioplasty for patients with
FMD.193(Level III) However, the benefits of angioplasty may be limited. The chance of
achieving normal BP without anti-hypertensive agents is less than 30%, although some
improvement in BP may be expected in an additional 50% or more.193
• Optimal medical management of ARAS includes ACEI or ARB for blood
pressure control and reduction of CV events, statins, low dose aspirin
and glycaemic control.
• Patients with RVH due to ARAS should be primarily medically managed
because renal angioplasty and stenting has not shown any advantage
over optimal medical therapy alone. (Grade B)
• Patients with RVH due to FMD should be considered for
revascularisation. (Grade B)

7.3.1 Hypertension and Coronary Heart Disease
Hypertension is the major risk factor for atherosclerosis, driving overall CV risk, thus
sustained good control is important. This is especially important in the presence
of other risk factors. Multiple CHD risk factors combine as multipliers, to increase
CHD risk that is greater than the sum of its individual components. Management
of patients with hypertension should consider the individual’s absolute CHD risk.
(Refer Table 3-D Risk Stratification) The decision to initiate drug treatment should
take this into consideration.
Although the recommended target is <140/90 mmHg, in those at high CV risk
in whom it is deemed safe on clinical grounds, and in whom drug therapy is well
tolerated, aiming for a lower blood pressure may be considered.116,117,194(Level 1)
Clinical studies have also shown that coronary events in hypertensive patients with
CHD are reduced in those whose blood pressure is controlled.195(Level 1) Based on
many studies using different groups of antihypertensives, the benefits are achieved
predominantly by lowering the blood pressure rather than the use of any specific
class of antihypertensive agent.96,196,197(Level 1)
There are clinical trials showing morbidity and mortality benefits of anti-hypertensive
agents such as ß-blockers, ACEIs and ARBs,198-200(Level 1) following myocardial
infarction. Following any coronary event, patients will be at high risk of subsequent
events, especially if the hypertension is not controlled. In the first 2 weeks after an
MI, ß-blockers have been shown to reduce re-infarctions and mortality in the short
term (30 days).201-204(Level 1)
Cardio-selective ß-blockers are preferred. In CHD patients with symptomatic &
stable angina, the treatment of choice should be a ß-blocker or a CCB. Short-acting
nifedipine should not be used.
Combination therapies, with suitable drugs should be considered to reduce adverse
effects and improve adherence (refer Chapter 5 Pharmacological Management).
7.3 Hypertension and Heart Disease
The blood pressure target in patients with hypertension
and CHD is <130 / <80 mmHg.116(Level 1)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
• Use ß-blockers, ACEIs or ARBs in post myocardial infarction patients to
reduce recurrent myocardial infarction and death. (Grade A)
• Initiate ß-blockers, ACEIs and Aldosterone antagonists in patients with
systolic heart failure to reduce morbidity and mortality. (Grade A)
• Use ARBs or ACEIs and aldosterone antagonist in heart failure patients
with preserved ejection fraction to reduce morbidity including
hospitalisation. (Grade A)
• Treat blood pressure to <140 / <90 mmHg.
RECOMMENDATIONS
7.3.2 Hypertension and Heart Failure
Hypertension is the most frequent underlying cause of heart failure. Chronic,
uncontrolled hypertension can cause heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(≤40%) (HFrEF).205
In hypertensive patients with HFrEF, hypertension aggravates heart failure by
increasing left ventricular afterload, promoting left ventricular remodeling and
progression of myocardial damage. Hypertension treatment is important for
improving the long-term prognosis.
Anti-hypertensive agents including ß-blockers,206-208 ACEIs,209 and aldosterone
antagonist,210 have shown mortality benefits and reduction in the number of
hospitalisations, in patients with HFrEF. In these patients, ACE inhibitors and ß-blockers
are recommended for initial therapy. ß-blockers are contraindicated in the presence
of acute heart failure. Careful monitoring for hyperkalaemia is recommended when
combining an aldosterone antagonist with an ACEI or ARB. The evidence for ARB is
less convincing211 but they may be used for ACEI intolerant patients.212-218
In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction >50% (HFpEF), blood
pressure control is important. For these patients, results with ARBs have been
mixed.213,215 Several randomised control trials evaluating the efficacy of ARBs found
no effect on prognosis including all-cause mortality. In these patients spironolactone
has been shown to reduce hospitalisation with HF.219
A meta-analysis with ACEI has shown a modest effect on HFpEF.220(Level 1) However, a
large-scale, prospective study (Swedish Heart Failure Registry) indicated that the total
mortality rate was lower in patients taking RAS blockers.221
Should hypertension be persistent in spite of ACEI / ARB, aldosterone antagonist
and/or ß-blocker, CCBs which are not negatively inotropic, such as amlodipine
and felodipine, can be added. These patients should also be on loop diuretics for
symptomatic relief.

Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.3.3 Hypertension and Atrial Fibrillation
Hypertension is the most important risk factor for new onset of atrial fibrillation
(AF)222,223 of which it increases the risk of cardiogenic cerebral embolism. In the
presence of AF, the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality increases by
2.5-fold224-226 In particular, left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement are
independent risk factors for new onset of atrial fibrillation. When antihypertensive
treatment leads to the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, the incidence of
atrial fibrillation decreases.227
Hypertension further increases the risks of stroke and arterial embolism in patients
with chronic atrial fibrillation.228,229
Although anticoagulants are used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF,
it also increases the incidence of hemorrhagic complications, especially intracranial
hemorrhage.230 Strict blood pressure control is necessary in patients taking
antithrombotic drugs.231
A few small studies 232,233 and subgroup analyses of larger trials 234,235 have reported
that ARB can reduce the incidence of recurrent atrial fibrillation or help maintain
patient in sinus rhythm.236
For elderly patients (>75 years old) who are on anticoagaulation for atrial fibrillation,
both ACEI and ARB reduce mortality.237(Level II-2)
For rate-control of permanent atrial fibrillation, ß-blockers or non-dihydropyridine
CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) should be considered.238
The blood pressure target is <140/90 mmHg.239
7.3.4 Hypertension and Peripheral Arterial Disease
Hypertension and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can co-exist. The risk factors
for PAD include hypertension, diabetes, current smoking and dyslipidaemia.240
As atherosclerosis is a systemic vascular disease; diffuse atherosclerosis, CAD,
and renovascular disease often coexist in these patients. 2-5% of patients with
hypertension have intermittent claudication and 25-55% of patients with peripheral
arterial disease present with hypertension.241
Patients with PAD have almost three times the risk of a cardiovascular event and
death.242 They should be screened for atherosclerotic disease of the other systems.
Control of hypertension in patients with PAD is poor.243 The aim of treatment in PAD is

Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.3.5 Hypertension and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)
Left Ventricular hypertrophy is caused by pressure load and often regresses through
long-term antihypertensive treatment. Those with LVH are at risk of premature
cardiovascular events or death.
The most important factor in the regression of cardiac hypertrophy is good BP
control. Hence all antihypertensives currently used can reduce cardiac hypertrophy
through sustained control of blood pressure.248,249 Regression of LVH can also
be achieved by weight reduction and salt restriction. Echocardiography is more
sensitive than ECG for detection of LVH.250 Several studies have suggested that
BP lowering leads to regression of LVH.251,252 To reduce clinical outcome, ARBs are
preferred in hypertension with LVH on ECG.112(Level 1)
• Treat blood pressure in hypertensives with peripheral arterial disease
(PAD) to <140/90 mmHg. (Grade B)
• Use any antihypertensive except ß-blockers as first choice. (Grade C)
• Give ACEI to patients with PAD to prevent vascular events. (Grade B)
• Consider cilostazol in the elderly patients with symptomatic CAD or PAD.
(Grade B)
• Counsel patients to stop smoking. (Grade B)
• Ensure other concurrent risk factors (especially diabetes, dyslipidaemia)
are optimally managed.
• Prescribe antiplatelet agent unless contraindicated. (Grade A)
RECOMMENDATIONS
The blood pressure target is <140/90 mmHg247(Level II-2)
both symptom relief and prevention of cardiovascular events. There is no consensus
on the treatment of choice for hypertensive patients with PAD,244 although subanalysis of major trials showed benefits of ACEI in patients with PAD.245 ß-blockers
may cause vasoconstriction and worsen frequency of intermittent claudication. They
may be used with caution in patients with compelling indications (CHD and/or HF).
Should patients present with Raynaud’s phenomenon, consider CCBs which have
vasodilating properties. Cilostazol has been shown to be useful especially in the
elderly with disabling peripheral arterial disease.246 In addition to these medications,
patients should stop smoking. Other therapies including LDL-cholesterol lowering
and better control of diabetes are also recommended.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for ischaemic stroke (IS)
and haemorrhagic stroke (HS).254 Blood Pressure levels are consistently shown to be
associated with the risk for stroke.255,256 Although both SBP and DBP are associated
with stroke, SBP is more predictive.257 Data from the Malaysian National Stroke Registry
(NSR) showed that more than 75% out of the 1018 patients included in the registry has
hypertension as its major risk factor.258
Worldwide, 15 million people suffer from stroke annually. Of these, 5 million die and
another 5 million are left permanently disabled.254 It is presently among the top four
leading causes of death in ASEAN countries.259 In Malaysia, stroke is the leading cause
of death and disability in adults. Its incidence has alarmingly increased annually by
29.5% (ischaemic stroke) and 18.7% (haemorrhagic stroke).258
7.4.1 Primary Prevention of Stroke
Systematic reviews of 17 primary prevention trials involving a total of 47,000
participants showed that lowering SBP by 10–12 mmHg and DBP by 5–6 mmHg
leads to a 38% reduction in the risk of stroke.260(Level 1)
The benefits have been shown in both systolic-diastolic hypertension and in isolated
systolic hypertension.261,262, (Level 1) All classes of antihypertensives have the potential to
prevent stroke. Calcium channel blockers in particular, provided significantly better
protection against stroke compared with diuretics and/or ß-blockers in Asian263(Level 1)
and Caucasian115(Level 1) populations. In the elderly264(Level 1) and very elderly113(Level 1)
hypertensives, diuretics has been shown to prevent stroke.
7.4.2 Treatment of Hypertension in Acute Stroke
Treatment of elevated BP in acute stroke is controversial.265 Stress-related high BP
values (>140/90 mmHg) are present in up to 80% of patients with acute stroke while
almost 25% of patient presents with markedly raised SBP values >180 mmHg.266,267
In a majority of patients, a decline in blood pressure without any specific medical
treatment will occur within days or weeks.268,269 A slightly higher systemic BP is
required to maintain the cerebral perfusion in the situation of increased intracranial
pressure, partial thrombosis and disturbed cerebral perfusion (See Figure 7.4-A).
7.4 Hypertension and Stroke
• Target BP <130/80 mmHg. (Grade A)
• Use ARBs as treatment of choice in hypertensive patients with LVH on
ECG. (Grade A)
RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.4.2.1 Ischaemic Stroke (IS)
Current guidelines recommend that treatment of hypertension in acute IS
should be delayed for several days or up to 2 weeks after an IS unless there is
hypertensive encephalopathy, severe left ventricular failure, acute renal failure,
acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, acute pulmonary oedema or
repeated BP readings reveal SBP values >220 mmHg and DBP >120 mmHg.270
(Table 7.4-A). Existing antihypertensive medications during the acute phase of
stroke should be deferred until patients have suitable enteral access and are
medically and neurologically stable.265 (Level III)
In cases where acute BP reduction is indicated, BP lowering should be done
cautiously targeting BP reduction of 10 to 20% from the baseline BP over
24 hours. More profound BP reductions (>20%) have been associated with
neurological and functional worsening.270 BP management in patients for
thrombolysis/thrombectomy will not be discussed in this guideline (Discussed
in the ischaemic stroke CPG).
7.4.2.2 Haemorrhagic Stroke (HS)
Current recommendations for treatment of elevated BP levels in patients with
acute HS are more aggressive than those with IS271(Level III) (Table 7.4-A). Both the
Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (ATACH) trial,271(Level 1)
a 4-tier dose-escalation study of intravenous nicardipine-based BP lowering in
80 patients within 3 hours of ICH, and the pilot phase Intensive Blood Pressure
Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (INTERACT1)272(Level 1) trial in 404
mainly Chinese patients within 6 hours of ICH found rapid reduction of SBP to
<140 mmHg to be safe. The INTERACT2 trial has shown no increase in death
or serious adverse events from early intensive BP lowering in eligible patients
with elevated SBP. INTERACT2273(Level 1) trial and subsequent meta-analysis274
have suggested that acute aggressive lowering of SBP to ≤140 mmHg within 3-6
hours of onset provide some evidence to indicate improved functional recovery.
The more recent ATACH-II trial enrolled patients within 4.5 hours of ICH onset.
They were randomly assigned to blood pressure reduction with intravenous
nicardipine to achieve systolic pressures in the range of 140 to 179 mmHg
(standard care) or 110 to 139 mmHg (intensive blood pressure lowering). This
trial took more aggressive and faster approach in BP lowering. Unfortunately, it
did not show any significant outcome in mortality and functional recovery. There
were significantly more renal adverse events within 7 days after randomisation in
the intensive-treatment group.275
Parenteral agents, such as labetalol or nicardipine that are easily titrated
and have minimal vasodilatory effects on cerebral blood flow are preferred.
Otherwise, easily titratable intravenous medications can also be used. The use
of sublingual nifedipine should be avoided because of the risk of abrupt BP
reduction and possible worsening ischaemia.270,273(Level III)

7.4.3 Secondary Prevention of Stroke
Patients who have had a stroke or a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) are at increased
risk of future stroke, especially in the following few months.277 Annual recurrence
rate is 12.5% per year.278 Survival rates decreased from 63.7%, 42.8% and 24% at 1,
5 and 10 years respectively. Of those who survived at 10 years, almost a third had
poor range of clinical outcomes.279
* Referenced from 153rd Edition, MIMS, 2018.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Lowering BP has been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent strokes.280,281 Meta
analyses of randomised controlled trials confirm approximately 30–40% reduction
in stroke risk with blood pressure lowering.282
Combination of ACEI and thiazide-like diuretic has been shown to reduce stroke
recurrence in both normotensive and hypertensive patients when treatment was
started at least two weeks after the stroke.79(Level 1)
Three additional large-scale randomised trials of antihypertensive medications after
stroke have been published. In one such trial, patient with hypertension and a stroke
or TIA within 2 years of the event were randomised to an ARB or CCB. Despite
similar BP reductions, recurrent total strokes and TIAs were less frequent among
those randomised to ARB. There was a reduction in primary composite events
which were significantly lower with ARB, with reduction in TIAs accounting for most
of the benefit of ARB.283(Level 1) However in a bigger trial, patients with Ischaemic
stroke were randomised to ARB or placebo within 90 days of an event with no clear
benefits of ARB in preventing recurrent stroke after 2.5 years of follow-up.284(Level 1) In
another placebo control trial involving ARB, patients with IS were randomised within
30 hours following onset of symptoms.285(Level 1) At 6 months follow-up, there were
no significant difference in the composite primary endpoint (stroke, myocardial
infarction, or vascular death). Taken together, a specific role for ARB in secondary
stroke prevention cannot be confirmed.286(Level 1)
The target BP after a stroke is less clear. More recent guidelines suggested a target
of <140/90 mmHg26(Level III) but the most recent major outcome trial suggest that for
patients with recent lacunar stroke, a target of <130/80 mmHg is beneficial287(Level 1)
especially for prevention of intracranial haemorrhage.
• Treat blood pressure to prevent both primary and secondary stroke.(Grade A)
• Do not lower SBP <180 mmHg in the first 2 weeks in acute ischaemic stroke
patients unless hypertensive emergencies co-exist. (Grade C)
• Do not lower SBP to <140 mmHg in patients presenting within 6 hours of
haemoraghic stroke (HS) and BP of <220 mmHg. (Grade C)
• Consider aggressive reduction of BP in HS patients presenting with SBP >220
mmHg with continuous intravenous infusion of antihypertensive and frequent BP
monitoring. (Grade C)
• Avoid lowering BP abruptly with sublingual nifedipine in acute stroke. (Grade C)
• Lower BP to be <140/90 mmHg in both normotensive and hypertensive patients
for secondary prevention. (Grade A)
• Lower BP to <130/80 mmHg for secondary prevention in lacunar stroke. (Grade A)

Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Hypertension is a very common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality in older people. The definition of hypertension in the older adult (>65
years old) is the same as that of the general adult population. Hypertension is an
increasingly important public health concern as our population ages. The prevalence
of hypertension in adults >65 in Malaysia has been reported to be 71.7%,288 and the
proportion of older adults in Malaysia is expected to increase from 9.0% in 2017 to 15%
of the total population by 2030.289
Hypertension magnifies the risk for cardiovascular disease, with each 20
mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and 10 mmHg increase in diastolic
BP associated with a doubling in risk of death from stroke and coronary artery
disease.255 In older adults, the risk of cardiovascular events and death is twice as
that observed in younger individuals at same levels of BP.4 SBP increases linearly
with age, leading to an increase in prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension
in the older adult. SBP is a better predictor of cardiovascular events than DBP.290
Treatment of hypertension in the older adult, particularly of high SBP, significantly
reduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular
events (myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke).6,79,83,113,117,151,253,262,263,287,291-295(Level 1)
There is evidence that this benefit extends to even the very elderly (>80 years old).113(Level1)
Despite the profusion of published data, there remains ongoing debate regarding
optimal management of BP in the older adults, with various guidelines espousing
different targets and treatment recommendations. The term ‘hypertension in older
adults’ itself causes some difficulty as it encompasses the age groups of the ‘youngold’ (65-70 years) to the ‘old-old’ (>80 years). This group of patients is extremely
heterogeneous with regards to comorbidities, frailty, and physical and cognitive
functioning. Hypertension trials are also widely variable in terms of age cut-offs,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient cardiovascular risk profiles, treatment regimens
and method of BP measurement.
Current evidence supports treating the older adult to a target SBP of <150 mmHg to
improve all cardiovascular outcomes.6,113,262,293(Level 1) There is some evidence that targeting
a SBP of <140 mmHg may be beneficial, especially in reducing risk of stroke,296,297 whilst
a recent trial supports even stricter targets (SBP <130 mmHg).117(Level 1)
7.5.1 Considerations in the Older Adults
Hypertension management in older adults are often complicated by the various
pathologies associated with aging. There are numerous challenges including multiple
comorbidities, postural hypotension, falls, functional and cognitive impairment and
frailty. These conditions frequently overlap. The absolute benefit of aggressive BP
treatment in older adults with multiple comorbidities and frailty is not well known.
7.5 Hypertension in the Older Adults
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.5.1.1 Multiple Comorbidities
Multiple morbidity increases with age and its prevalence is estimated to be about
65% and 82% for those aged 65-84 and 85 years and above respectively.298
Multimorbidity is defined as the presence of 2 or more long term conditions.299
At least two-thirds of hypertensive patients have another chronic disease.
There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide management
of hypertension in this group of patients.300 Observational studies imply that a
SBP of 140-160 mmHg is associated with better mortality outcomes in older
adults with impaired physical or cognitive functioning.301-307(Level II- 2) Observational
data have also found that treating to lower targets (SBP <120 mmHg and DBP
<70 mmHg) may increase the risk of death and cardiac events in older high-risk
individuals (those with CAD, LVH and diabetes mellitus),308-314(Level II-2) supporting a
J-curve association between both SBP and DBP and adverse outcomes in older
persons.
7.5.1.2 Polypharmacy and Adverse Drug Reactions
Polypharmacy is another feature associated with older adults and has been shown
to be related to poor outcomes including postural hypotension, falls, electrolyte
disturbances, heart failure, hospitalisation and mortality.315 Antihypertensives
commonly contribute to polypharmacy in older adults.316 Adverse drug reactions
are more frequent and often more severe in older adults due to physiological
changes affecting drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, presence of
multiple comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Therefore, it is important to critically
evaluate the need for each medication.
7.5.1.3 Postural Hypotension and Falls
Advancing age is associated with an independent increase in prevalence of
postural hypotension. Postural hypotension is defined as a sustained reduction in
SBP of at least 20 mmHg or DBP of 10 mmHg from lying to standing position.317
In symptomatic older adults it is recommended to check BP up to 3 minutes of
standing. Both uncontrolled hypertension, especially ISH, and aggressive BP
treatment have been associated with postural hypotension.318-322(Level II-1) Postural
hypotension, symptomatic or not, is associated with falls in older adults.318,323,324(Level II-2)
Less strict BP targets may therefore be acceptable in the very elderly, the frail,
those with multimorbidities and previous fallers.322(Level III)
7.5.1.4 Cognition
In addition to cardiovascular disease, another pertinent health concern for the
ageing Malaysian population is cognitive decline and dementia. Dementia has a
devastating impact on quality of life, and is associated with significant escalation
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
of healthcare expenditure. Hypertension in midlife (40-65 years old) has been
found in longitudinal studies to be a risk factor for developing cognitive decline
in later life. Hypertension predisposes mainly to development of vascular
cognitive impairment, but has also been found to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s
pathology.325,326(Level II-2)
Evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effect of antihypertensive
treatment on incident cognitive decline and dementia in older adults has
largely been negative, due to most trials being of insufficient duration,6,295,327-329
although observational studies of up to 20 years suggest a benefit.301 Conversely,
observational data suggest that aggressive treatment of hypertension (to <130
mmHg SBP and <70 mmHg DBP) in older adults is associated with increased risk
of new-onset cognitive impairment,301,325,326 and more rapid cognitive decline in
individuals with established dementia.330
7.5.1.5 Frailty
Frailty increases in the older adult, especially in those over 80.331 It is defined as
increased vulnerability to physical stressors as a result of reduced physiological
reserve.332 The HYVET trial showed benefit of treating hypertension in adults >80
years of age and did not find any effect of frailty on the benefit of hypertensive
treatment. However, it should be noted that HYVET excluded the very frail.
Post-hoc analysis of the SHEP trial333(Level II-1) found that the benefit of treatment
on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality disappeared in those with functional
impairment. Observational studies have also demonstrated the importance of
frailty status on hypertension and outcomes.301,303(Level II-2) Therefore, results from
the HYVET and SPRINT trials which support treatment in the very elderly and
intensive therapy respectively need to be interpreted with caution. Goals should
be driven by patients’ functional status and comorbidities.
7.5.2 Assessment
Recommendations for BP measurements in older adults are similar to those for the
general population. If there is presence of postural hypotension, the standing BP is
used to guide treatment decisions.
It is very important to ascertain hypertension and the true level of BP before
commencing or adding pharmacological therapy. We advocate multiple readings
using an automated office blood pressure monitor after up to 3 minutes of quiet
rest.
Evaluation of older patients with hypertension should not differ from that of younger
adult populations. In cases of resistant hypertension, secondary causes such as
atheromatous renal artery disease should similarly be ruled out.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Where appropriate, one should consider a formal frailty assessment using one of
the validated tools.334(Level II) At a minimum, one should observe for a reduction in
mobility, decreased functional ability and impaired cognition.
7.5.3 Treatment
The >65’s are the most medically heterogeneous population and a simple ‘one size
fits all’ approach would not be appropriate. Individualised decision in the context of
comorbidities and patient tolerance to medication(s) is important.
Therapy should be started cautiously with monotherapy at a low dose and titrated
upwards slowly. The patient should be reviewed frequently in the initial stage (2 – 4
weeks). Initiation with combination therapy is not encouraged and considered only
after failure of initial therapy.
In the presence of ADRs such as postural hypotension and falls, de-prescribing
should be considered. There is evidence that de-prescribing does not result in an
increase in mortality in this group of patients.335 This will also improve pill burden for
the patient and address polypharmacy.
Treat the older adult when SBP is >160 mmHg. Treatment targets are as stated below:
For fit* 65-80 years old patients consider target SBP <130 mmHg.
* free from health conditions that limit mobility and/or functional ability with good nutrition and

have been proven to be efficacious in the older adults.336(Level 1) Refer to chapter 4 for
more on non-pharmacological methods.

7.5.4 Conclusion
There are many challenges in treating hypertension in the older adult. Managing
blood pressure in isolation is not conducive to achieving a patient-centered
approach. BP targets depend on many factors unique to each patient. Healthcare
providers must be mindful that in older adults, additional aspects must be
considered before starting therapy. These include frailty, physical and cognitive
functioning, and tolerance to treatment. Less strict BP targets may be considered
in certain situations.
• Treatment of hypertension in the older adult, particularly of high SBP,
significantly reduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
mortality, and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, heart failure
and stroke), even in the very elderly.
• There is strong evidence of benefit for treating to target SBP <150
mmHg.
• There is some evidence for treating to even lower target SBPs in certain
subgroups of older adults.
• Older patients with multimorbidities, cognitive or functional impairment
and frailty are under represented in randomised control trials for
hypertension. Observational studies suggest worse outcomes in these
patients.
• Measure standing BP and use it to guide treatment decision. (Grade C)
• Assess comprehensively to confirm hypertension. (Grade C)
• Assess for frailty, mobility, function, cognition, nutrition, postural
hypotension and falls. (Grade C)
• Individualised treatment based on clinical scenarios. (Grade C)
• Target SBP <150 mmHg for >80 year olds. (Grade A)
• Target SBP <140 mmHg for 65-80 year olds. (Grade B)
• Consider SBP <130 mmHg in fit 65-80 year olds. (Grade A)
• Apply less strict targets for the frail, functionally and/or cognitivelyimpaired, those with multi-morbidities and those with adverse reactions
from therapy. Consider de-prescribing in this group of patients. (Grade C)

Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.6.1 Hypertension in Pregnancy
Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg
and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg.337 An increase of SBP of 30 mmHg
and DBP of 15 mmHg above baseline BP is no longer recognised as hypertension
if absolute values are below 140/90 mmHg. Nevertheless, this warrants close
observation, especially if proteinuria and hyperuricaemia are also present.338
Korotkoff V should be used as the cut-off point for DBP, and Korotkoff IV utilised
only when Korotkoff V is absent.337(Level III) The gold standard tool to measure blood
pressure in preeclampsia is still the mercury sphygmomanometer.337 In the absence of
a mercury sphygmomanometer, an automated blood pressure measuring device can
be used provided it is calibrated annually against the mercury sphygmomanometer.
Automated devices are acceptable for BP measurement in pregnancy based on a
prospective study, which showed that there was no difference in the maternal and
fetal outcomes despite lower DBP reading using the automated device.339
7.6.1.1 Proteinuria
Significant proteinuria in pregnancy is defined as ≥300 mg protein in a 24hour urine sample, or a spot urine protein-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/mmol.337
If the dipstick is the only test available, 2+ is approximated to ≥300 mg/day
proteinuria.337 Significant proteinuria reflects advanced disease and is associated
with poorer prognosis.
7.6.1.2 Classification
There are various classifications for Hypertension in Pregnancy. The most recent
is by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy
(ISSHP). 337
1. Preeclampsia (PE): de novo or superimposed on chronic hypertension
a. PE is clinically diagnosed in the presence of de novo hypertension after
20 weeks gestation, with one or more of the following:
i. Significant proteinuria
ii. Renal insufficiency: serum creatinine ≥90 micromol/l or oliguria
iii. Liver disease: raised transaminases and/or severe right upper
quadrant or epigastric pain
iv. Neurological problems: convulsions (eclampsia), hyperreflexia
with clonus or severe headaches, persistent visual disturbances
(scotoma)
7.6 Hypertension in Women
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
v. Haematological disturbances: thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy,
haemolysis
vi. Fetal growth restriction
b. PE superimposed on chronic hypertension is diagnosed in the presence
of any of the following, in a woman with chronic hypertension:
i. De novo proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation
ii. A sudden increase in the severity of hypertension
iii. Appearance of features of PE-eclampsia, and
iv. Worsening proteinuria in a woman with pre-existing proteinuria
early in gestation
This is followed by normalisation of the BP by three months postpartum.
Oedema is no longer part of the definition of PE.340 Excessive weight gain or
failure to gain weight in pregnancy may herald the onset of PE.341
2. Gestational hypertension is defined as hypertension detected for the first
time after 20 weeks gestation. Although it usually runs a benign course,
it can progress into PE in 25% of cases, more so if it presents before 34
weeks.337
3. Isolated office hypertension is defined as elevated BP of 140/90 mmHg only
in the clinic with normal BP demonstrated by ambulatory BP monitoring
(ABPM) either awake or during sleep. In the absence of ABPM device,
HBPM can be used. Studies in non-pregnant population showed that they
are comparable.342 Women in this group should not be considered low risk
as they may progress to gestational hypertension (50%) or PE (8%).337,343
4. Chronic hypertension is hypertension diagnosed prior to 20 weeks gestation
or presence of hypertension preconception, or de novo hypertension in
late gestation that fails to resolve three months postpartum.

7.6.1.3 Key Points in Primary Care Practice
The primary care physician plays an important role in the prevention and early
detection of PE and its complications. An obstetrician should lead the joint
management of women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.
1. Preconception counseling and adjustment of treatment in women with
chronic hypertension.
Women with chronic hypertension may require a change in the type of antihypertensive agent used pre-pregnancy.345(Level III) The drugs of choice in
pregnancy are methyldopa and labetalol (Table 7.6-A). Atenolol has been
shown to lead to fetal growth restriction. The use of ARBs, ACEIs and thiazide
diuretics are associated with fetal anomaly and are therefore contraindicated
in pregnancy.346 Women in the reproductive age group requiring these drugs
should be on effective contraception. In the event of unplanned pregnancy,
the drugs must be stopped.347
It should be noted that the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy is solely
for maternal safety particularly for prevention of intracranial bleeding. It does
not reduce the risk of development of preeclampsia or perinatal mortality,
nor improve fetal growth.348 There is still no clear evidence on the target
BP that should be achieved prior to or during pregnancy. A recent study
comparing less tight (target DBP of 100 mmHg) against tight (target DBP 85
mmHg) control of BP in women with non-proteinuric chronic hypertension or
gestational hypertension showed no significant differences between these
two groups with regard to both maternal and perinatal complications.349
Risk
Risk Factors
Moderate349
• primigravida
• age >40 years
• pregnancy interval >10 years
• body mass index of >35 kg/m2 at first visit
• family history of PE
• multiple pregnancy
High349
• hypertensive disease during previous pregnancy
• chronic kidney disease
• autoimmune disease such as Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (SLE) or anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS)
• type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and
• chronic hypertension
2. Recognition of women at risk of preeclampsia for commencement of
prophylaxis.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
3. Prophylactic therapy
a. Aspirin
Women with ≥2 moderate or one high risk factor should be started
on low dose aspirin from 12 weeks up to 16 weeks of gestation until
delivery.350 The dosage should be 100-150 mg and taken at bedtime in
order to significantly reduce the incidence of PE.351-353
b. Calcium
A systematic review showed that low dose calcium supplement (generally
500-1000mg daily) commenced before 20 weeks gestation reduces the
risk of PE.354
c. Vitamin D
There is no proven role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of PE.355
d. Others
Other supplements in pregnancy such as marine oil, garlic, and pyridoxine
have no proven benefits.356-358 Combined vitamin C and E (i.e. tocopherol
from soybean) should be avoided because they significantly increase the
incidence of low birth weight without any preventive effect against PE.359
4. Prediction of the incidence of preeclampsia
A predictive test that is available locally, measuring serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratio
from 20 weeks of gestation onwards has good negative predictive value
for a week. It is useful in identifying which patients require admission and
close monitoring. It will also help to decide on the need for antenatal
corticosteroids in anticipation of pre-term delivery.360
5. Fetal anomaly screening
Women with chronic hypertension have about 20-30% increased risk for
fetal congenital cardiac anomaly.361 These women are to be referred to
the Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) specialist in the tertiary centre to be
recommended to undergo nuchal translucency (NT) scan at 12-14 weeks
followed by a detailed ultrasound scan at 22-24 weeks of gestation. If a
cardiac anomaly is detected, cardiology referral is recommended.
6. Prevention of eclampsia and other complications of preeclampsia
Patient and healthcare provider education on the importance of signs
and symptoms of preeclampsia for early diagnosis and referral for further
management may prevent progression to eclampsia.362,363(Level II-2)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.6.1.4 Severe Preeclampsia
Severe preeclampsia must be promptly identified so that the patient can
be urgently admitted to hospital for close observation and timely delivery.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines severe
preeclampsia based on the following features:364
a. Systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg on two occasions at
least 4 hours apart while the patient is resting
b. Thrombocytopenia – platelet count below 100,000/cm3
c. Abnormal liver enzymes (elevated AST/ALT), severe persistent right upper
quadrant or epigastric pain unresponsive to treatment
d. Pulmonary oedema
e. New onset of cerebral or visual disturbances
Diagnosis of severe preeclampsia should not depend solely on the above criteria.
If in doubt, it is better to over rather than under diagnose. This will prevent delay
in referral. Any patient with preeclampsia should be closely monitored, as the
progression to severe preeclampsia is unpredictable and rapid.
In the event of an acute hypertensive crisis, IV hydralazine, IV labetalol, or
oral nifedipine, may be used to lower the BP.365,366(Level I) Sublingual nifedipine
is no longer recommended (Table 7.6-B).367(Level III) Diuretics are generally
contraindicated as they reduce plasma volume, may cause Intrauterine Growth
Restriction (IUGR) and may possibly increase perinatal mortality. Their only use
is in the treatment of acute pulmonary oedema.341(Level III) In order to reduce the
risk of maternal stroke, the blood pressure should be reduced within 30-60
minutes.368
7.6.1.5 Anticonvulsants in Preeclampsia-Eclampsia
Parenteral magnesium sulphate is currently the drug of choice for the prevention
of eclampsia and to abort an eclamptic fit (Table 7.6-C).367,369(Level 1) The alternative
is intravenous diazepam, bearing in mind that it is inferior in efficacy compared to
magnesium sulphate. Magnesium sulphate also provides fetal neuroprotection
following preterm birth with a significant reduction in the incidence of cerebral
palsy.370
7.6.1.6 Postpartum Care
Postpartum, women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are advised to
have their BP checked regularly at local clinics if there is a significant delay
in their scheduled hospital follow-up. In these patients, the dose of antihypertensive should be tailed down gradually and not stopped suddenly.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
On average, anti-hypertensive agents are required for longer in women with
preeclampsia (approximately two weeks) compared with those with gestational
hypertension (approximately one week) although there is substantial variability
among women that cannot be predicted reliably.371
De novo onset of hypertension or aggravation of BP levels during the postpartum
period can occur.372 These patients should be promptly referred to hospital
especially if there is significant proteinuria.(Level III) Eclampsia may occur in the
postpartum period. Chronic hypertension is diagnosed when the hypertension
and/or proteinuria persist after three months postpartum.337,338
7.6.1.7 Long Term Follow-Up
Evidence suggests that up to 13% of women with preeclampsia will have
underlying essential hypertension that was not suspected antenatally.373 In
addition, following severe preeclampsia, there is an increased risk of ischaemic
heart disease, thromboembolism and stroke.374 Long-term follow-up of patients
with a history of hypertension in pregnancy is therefore advisable. (Level III)
7.6.1.8 Reducing Mortality
A substantial reduction in preeclampsia/eclampsia related mortality could
be achieved by widespread screening for hypertension and proteinuria. Early
referral and delivery is indicated for severe PE.375

Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
7.6.2 Hypertension and Oral Contraceptives
Combined oral contraceptives (COC) can induce significant increases in BP with
chronic use, which is nearly always reversible after 4 weeks of discontinuation.379
Hypertension has been reported even with low-dose-oestrogen monophasic
pills.380 A woman who develops hypertension while using COC should be advised to
stop taking them and should be offered alternative forms of contraception.381(Level III)
Low dose combined hormonal contraceptives should only be used if no other
method is suitable, even for women with controlled hypertension.382
Drospirenone (a progestin), has anti-mineralocorticoid diuretic effects, and
can lower BP when combined with oestrogen in COCs.383 It is a recommended
alternative for patients with hypertension or who developed hypertension but wish
to continue oral contraception. All progestogen-only methods are appropriate
except in women whose BP is higher than 160/100 mmHg. In these patients, the
injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is contraindicated, along
with all oestrogen-containing contraceptives.381
• Use Korotkoff V to diagnose and monitor to treatment of
hypertension in pregnant women. (Grade C)
• Consider automated BP device instead of mercury
sphygmomanometer to diagnose and monitor treatment. (Grade A)
• Provide counselling and appropriate management to women with
chronic hypertension and who are planning for pregnancy. (Grade C)
• Avoid RAS blockers in all women of childbearing potential unless
adequate precaution has been taken against pregnancy. (Grade A)
• Refer pregnant women with hypertension to the obstetrician for
further management. (Grade C)
• Provide calcium supplementation from early pregnancy to prevent
PE. (Grade A)
• Commence aspirin from 12-16 weeks and continue until delivery in
pregnant women with one or more high risk factors or two or more
moderate risk factors for PE. (Grade A)
• Use oral nifedipine 10 mg stat dose to rapidly control BP in acute
hypertensive crisis prior to transfer to hospital. (Grade C)

Baseline BP must be assessed before initiating hormonal contraceptives. Blood
pressure should then be measured at least every six months.(Level III) The same applies
to usage of the combined contraceptive patch and the vaginal ring.
7.6.3 Hypertension and Menopausal Hormonal Therapy
The presence of hypertension is not a contraindication to oestrogen-based
menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT). It is recommended that all women treated
with MHT should have their BP monitored every six months.(Level III) The decision to
continue or discontinue hormonal therapy in these patients should be individualised.
Two large trials on women aged 50-79 years, concluded that the use of MHT
increased cardiovascular events.384,385 (Level I) Conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), alone
or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate, was used in the study. In view
of this, greater caution and closer monitoring is required for hypertensive patients
on CEE. Drospirenone when used as progestin in HRT, showed improvement in BP
control.379,386
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Hypertension in Neonates and Infants
The incidence of hypertension in neonates admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
was 1.3%.387
It is more common in neonates and infants with antenatal steroids, maternal hypertension,
postnatal acute renal failure, chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus or in those
with indwelling umbilical arterial catheters.387 Catheter related hypertension is related
to thrombus formation at the time of line placement.388
Measurement of BP
Healthy term neonates rarely have hypertension. Routine BP measurements are not
advocated in this group. The gold standard of BP measurement in neonates is by direct
measurement of arterial pulse pressure wave form.
Standardised Protocol for BP Measurement in Neonates:389,390
• measure by oscillometric device
• lie prone or supine
• use appropriate sized BP cuff
• use right upper arm
• measured when infant is asleep or in quiet awake state
• 3 successive BP reading at 2 min intervals
A reference table for BP values after two weeks of age in infants from 26 to 44 weeks has
been derived after taking into consideration gestational age at birth, postconceptional
age and size for gestational age. The 95th and 99th percentile values are intended to
serve as reference to identify infants with persistent hypertension that may require
treatment.389 (Refer to Appendix 1)
Treatment is recommended when BP is consistently above the 99th percentile. There
are few published case series that used diuretics, ACEI, ß-blockers and CCB.389(Level II-2)
There is concern over the use of ACEI in preterm neonates.391 It has been reported to
cause an exaggerated fall in BP and may impair the final stages of nephron maturation
and it use is best avoided until 44 weeks postconceptional age.389,392(Level III)
7.7 Hypertension in Neonates, Children and Adolescents
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Hypertension in Children and Adolescents
In Malaysia, the prevalence of hypertension in primary school children in one study was
13.4%.393
Prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents is increasing in tandem with the
increasing prevalence of obesity in this group.394,395
The NHMS 2016 has shown that the prevalence of obesity among children below 5
years was 6% (Weight for Height >+2SD).396 In 2011, the prevalence of obesity among
children below 10 years was 5.3%.397
Measurement of BP: Who and when398
1. Children ≥7 years old
• Healthy children: Measure annually if obese
• Children with diabetes, renal disease, aortic arch obstruction, coarctation or on
medications known to increase BP: Measure at every medical encounter
2. Children <7 years who are at risk of developing hypertension
Measure at every medical encounter for those with:
• history of complications requiring neonatal intensive care
• congenital heart disease
• recurrent urinary tract infections, hematuria or proteinuria
• known renal disease or urological malformation
• family history of congenital renal disease
• solid-organ transplant
• treatment with drugs known to raise BP
• other systemic illness associated with hypertension (neurofibromatosis, tuberous
sclerosis)
• evidence of raised intracranial pressure
Although the latest guidelines from the US Task force recommends the age cut off to be
3 years, we recommend 7 years taking into consideration the current state of resources
in the primary health centre.(Level III)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
BP Measurement Technique
1. The initial BP measurement may be oscillometric.399 (On a calibrated machine that
has been validated for use in the pediatric population.)
2. If BP level >90th percentile on oscillometric devices, confirmatory measurement
should be obtained by auscultation. Re-measure BP twice by using auscultatory
technique and average these two.
3. Measurement of BP in children follows the same principles as set out in the
section on BP measurement. Special attention needs to be paid in selection of an
appropriate cuff size in relation to the child’s right upper arm.
• The diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents is made when
the auscultated BP values on three repeated and different visits are greater
than the 95th percentile for age, sex, and height of the patient, or is ≥130/90
mmHg (whichever is lower).398
SUMMARY
Height and gender are important determinants of pediatric BP. BP levels are interpreted
based on gender, age and height. In the 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics
guidelines, normative table were revised by using data from normal-weight children
only. (Refer to Appendix 2 & 3)

Once a child is diagnosed with hypertension, he should be referred to a paediatrician
for further evaluation and management.400
The healthcare provider should obtain a perinatal, nutritional, physical activity,
psychosocial and family history and perform a physical examination to identify finding
suggestive of secondary causes of hypertension.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Primary Hypertension
Children and adolescents ≥6 years of age do not require an extensive evaluation for
secondary causes of hypertension if they have a positive family history of hypertension,
are overweight or obese, and/or do not have history or physical examination findings
suggestive of a secondary cause of hypertension.
Secondary Hypertension
Causes of secondary hypertension in children:
• Renal parenchymal disease and renal structure abnormality (most common)
• Renovascular disease
• Coarctation of the aorta
• Endocrine hypertension
• Drug induced (corticosteroids)
Screening test and relevant population
1. Routine investigations to be performed in all patients
• Urinalysis
• Chemistry panel (electrolytes, urea, and creatinine)
• Lipid profile
• Renal ultrasonography in those <6 years of age or those with abnormal
urinalysis or renal function
2. Investigations to assess comorbidities (the obese child)
• Fasting blood sugar
• Haemoglobin A1c
• AST, ALT
3. Optional tests to be obtained on the basis of history and initial study
Isolated Office Hypertension
A patient with BP levels >95th percentile in a doctor’s office but who is normotensive
outside a clinical setting has “Isolated Office Hypertension”.
Ambulatory blood pressure measurement is necessary to confirm hypertension in
otherwise healthy children. ABPM levels should be interpreted with appropriate
paediatric normative data for children >5 years of age or height of ≥120 cm. Isolated
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 7. Hypertension in Special Groups
Goals of Therapy398(Level III)
office hypertension is diagnosed by ABPM when the mean SBP and DBP <95th percentile
and SBP and DBP load <25%.401
Isolated office hypertension does not require treatment but may need repeat ABPM in
one- to two-year intervals to detect development of sustained hypertension.
Treatment of Paediatric Hypertension
Goals of therapy for children with hypertension:
• To achieve a BP level that reduces the risk of target organ damage.
• To reduce risk of premature atherosclerosis and early development of
cardiovascular disease.
• To reduce risk of developing adult hypertension and metabolic syndrome.402-404
Lifestyle and Non-Pharmacologic Treatment
Non-pharmacologic management including dietary changes, exercise and weight
reduction (if obese) is recommended in all children with hypertension.398
Pharmacologic Treatment
Definite indications for initiating pharmacotherapy include:398
• hypertension with failed lifestyle modification
• stage 2 hypertension without a clearly modifiable factor (e.g. obesity)
• any stage of hypertension associated with chronic kidney disease or diabetes
mellitus
• hypertension with target organ damage
Clinicians should initiate pharmacologic treatment with an ACEI, ARB, long-acting
calcium channel blocker, or thiazide diuretic.

• For obese children >7 years old: measure annually.
• Once a child is diagnosed with hypertension, he should be referred to a
paediatrician for further evaluation and management.
• At the time of diagnosis of hypertension, clinician should provide advice
on diet and recommend moderate to vigorous physical activity to help to
reduce BP.
• Once pharmacologic therapy is initiated, BP must be reduced to <90th

Hypertension and its sequelae results in a huge healthcare burden. It is the major
risk factor for stroke, MI, HF and end-stage renal disease.258,406-408 More than half of
hypertensives are unaware and almost two thirds of patients on treatment are not
controlled.288
The cost of treating hypertension consists of direct and indirect cost. Direct cost
includes the cost of treatment (drugs, investigations, healthcare providers time and
transportation) whereas indirect cost measures the income lost due to hypertension
and its complications. A difficult to measure indirect cost would be the cost to society
in managing patients with sequelae of hypertension (e.g. managing patients with a
hypertensive bleed, hypertensive heart and renal failure).
A study in a primary care setting showed that more than half of treatment cost is driven
by antihypertensive medications. This cost increases as the severity of hypertension
increases.409,410 The direct cost to the Ministry of Health for antihypertensive medication
has steadily increased from RM570.3 million in 2014 to RM608.8 million in 2016.411
The direct and indirect cost for hypertensive complications is not available for Malaysia.
A study in Malaysia showed that the estimated direct cost for complications in patients
with diabetes for the outcomes of stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure to be
as high as RM12,685 per admission. The estimated cost of diabetes complication to
the country annually may be as high as RM3.52 billion based on the highest estimate
sensitivity analysis. It is likely that hypertension complication with its higher prevalence
would cost more than this. 412
Patients with hypertension have a significantly higher risk of developing CKD which is
associated with a high socioeconomic burden. The annual cost of chronic haemodialysis
was RM40,557 and peritoneal dialysis was RM38,138 per patient per year in 2009. The
average cost of adult living kidney transplant was RM29,482.413 The total estimated cost
for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) was RM1.7 billion. Hypertension contributed to at
least 20% of this cost (RM340 million).
Treating hypertension is cost effective.414 A recent study showed that screening and
treating hypertension even for primary prevention has a high health impact (equivalent
to RM50,925 per QALY adjusted for purchasing parity).415 The impact on treating
hypertension for secondary prevention is expected to be even higher.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 8. Economic Impact of Hypertension
Community-based interventions such as education, screening and self-monitoring have
been shown to be cost effective in preventing and controlling hypertension. These
initiatives targeted health behavioural changes and medication adherence. They may
even reduce the cost of complications and long-term healthcare cost.415,416
The vast majority of antihypertensive drugs are now off patent, making generics more
affordable. For example, amlodipine became more affordable when its generic form
was introduced in 2009. This was evident in the public sector as the expenditure for
amlodipine dropped 10-fold, from RM85.8 million in 2008 to RM8.2 million in 2010
making hypertension treatment more cost effective.417
Hypertension is responsible for at least 45% and 51% of deaths from heart disease and
stroke respectively.418 A more concerted effort should be taken for the early diagnosis
and better control of hypertension. This will reduce the direct and indirect cost of
treating hypertension and its complications to the patients, family, society and the
government as a whole.
• Treating hypertension is cost effective especially with the widespread
availability of generic drugs.
• Conduct more awareness programmes on clinical and economic benefits in
prevention and early treatment of hypertension.
SUMMARY
RECOMMENDATIONS
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
9.1 DIURETICS
Diuretics, specifically thiazide diuretics, have been the mainstay of hypertension
treatment, alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensive agents. Diuretics work
via inducing natriuresis which alter long term sodium balance, leading to reduced
peripheral vascular resistance and sustained blood pressure reduction. Diuretics provide
synergistic effect to almost all anti-hypertensive agents, particularly renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) blockers. There were also outcome data that supported the potential
cardiovascular benefits of thiazide diuretics, particularly in those with preserved renal
function.419 (Level 1)
Thiazide diuretics are classified into thiazide (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazidelike diuretics, e.g. chlorthalidone (CTD) and indapamide. Locally, hydrochlorothiazide
(HCTZ) is the most commonly used thiazide diuretic. Most positive outcome studies
used thiazide-like diuretics, i.e. chlorthalidone5,89 and indapamide.113 Even though there
were no head to head trials comparing HCTZ and CTD, a systematic review and network
meta-analyses reported superiority of CTD to HCTZ in preventing cardiovascular
events. This difference might be attributed to the pleomorphic effects of CTD or to the
shorter duration of action of HCTZ.420(Level II-1)
HCTZ is effective in the range of 12.5mg – 50mg daily dose.421(Level II-1) However a dose
above 25mg per day is more likely to cause electrolyte and metabolic adverse effects.
The major out come data for the use of thiazide-like diuretics (CTD) was from ALLHAT
study.89(Level II-1) Chlorthalidone-based regimen was equally effective in reducing clinical
outcome as lisinopril and amlodipine. In chronic kidney disease with eGFR<30ml/
min/1.73m2, thiazide diuretics are less effective and a switch to loop diuretics is
recommended.
A recent case-control study highlighted a significant increase in the risk of skin and lip
squamous cell carcinoma among thiazide diuretics users.422,423 (Level II-2) There was a clear
dose-response effect with the highest cumulative dose of HCTZ having the highest risk.
There was more than 7-fold increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma for a cumulative
use of ≥200,000 mg HCTZ (equivalent to 50mg daily for a duration of more than 11
years). Even though this is an observational study, the risk is not negligible.

Chapter 9. Types of Antihypertensive Agents
Beta-blockers have long been used in the treatment of hypertension. They are
particularly useful in hypertensive patients with effort angina, tachyarrhythmias or
previous myocardial infarction where they have been shown to reduce cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality. Certain ß-blockers have been shown to be beneficial in
patients with heart failure. (Table 5-C)
Beta-blockers are absolutely contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled asthma
and relatively contraindicated in other forms of obstructive airways disease (including
controlled bronchial asthma). It is also absolutely contraindicated in patients with severe
peripheral vascular disease and heart block (2nd and 3rd degree).
They are generally well tolerated. Adverse effects reported include dyslipidaemia,
masking of hypoglycaemia, and increased incidence of new onset diabetes mellitus.
Despite that, a long-term follow-up of a study in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
showed that the benefit of ß-blocker persisted and is even better than an ACEI.424(Level II-2)
Other reported adverse events include erectile dysfunction, cold extremities and
nightmares (especially for lipophilic ß-blockers), increased triglyceride levels and
reduced HDL levels (especially for non-selective ß-blockers). Use of ß-blockers during
pregnancy is cautioned.
In a major landmark study, an ARB was shown to be superior than ß-blocker in patients
with high risk hypertension and ECG LVH112 (Level 1) This prompted a meta-analysis on the
use of ß-blockers in the treatment of hypertension.92 Beta-blocker therapy did not reduce
the risk for first myocardial infarction compared to other drugs but was associated with
a significant 16% higher risk for stroke when compared to non- ß-blocker therapy and
that atenolol in particular was associated with a significant 26% increase in the risk of
stroke when compared to other anti-hypertensive agents. Beta-blockers lower brachial
systolic blood pressure but not the aortic pressure compared to other drugs. Heart
rate is reduced but peripheral resistance is increased, thus increasing the arterial wave
reflection during systole rather than diastole.425 (Level II-1) Similarly, another meta-analysis94

and a systematic review also showed that ß-blockers were associated with a significant
increase in their withdrawal due to side effects.426
Caution is necessary in the interpretations of negative findings from earlier analysis on
ß-blocker as:
• most of the studies involved atenolol (hence the comparative outcomes of other
newer vasodilatating ß-blockers are not well established as there has been no
comparative studies between the ß-blocker sub-classes.
• almost all the studies were carried out in the West, hence the comparative outcomes
of other ethnic groups are not well established.
However, more recent meta analysis showed that ß-blocker is as effective as other drugs
in improving clinical outcome.95-98 The latest Cochrane Review95 however indicates that
as first line treatment, they are:
• inferior to CCB for total mortality outcomes.
• better than placebo for total CVD (primarily driven by decrease strokes) but no
better than other classes of anti-hypertensive agents.
• better than placebo for strokes but worse than CCB and no better than other
classes of anti-hypertensive agents for total coronary heart disease outcome.
It is thus reasonable for ß-blockers to be used as single first line therapy to initiate
anti-hypertensive therapy for patients with hypertension especially if there are specific
compelling needs for its use such as those with post-MI or heart failure. Some guidelines
like The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) UK Guideline,4 JNC VIII90 and
the ACC/AHA1 did not recommend ß-blockers as first line anti-hypertensive agent. It
is however still recommended as first line by other guidelines.26,101 including guidelines
from this region. 102,427,428
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 9. Types of Antihypertensive Agents
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a structurally and functionally heterogenous class
of drug. The main mechanism of action is vasodilation, which decreases peripheral
resistance. Certain subtypes of dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs, e.g. T-type CCBs have
been shown to dilate both the afferent and efferent arterioles, reduce glomerular
capillary pressure and proteinuria. This may play a role in prevention of kidney damage
and preservation of renal function.
In view of the effective BP lowering property and excellent safety profile, CCBs especially
dihydropyridine (DHP) type have been recommended as first-line anti-hypertensive agents.
A metanalysis showed that CCBs reduced stroke in hypertensive patients more than
placebo and ß-blockers but were not different than ACE inhibitors and diuretics.429 (Level 1)
However, there is no evidence that dihydropyridine CCBs are superior to other
antihypertensive agents in Asian populations for the treatment of hypertension in
reducing cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular events, stroke, congestive heart
failure, and coronary revascularisation.430 (Level 1)
Metanalyses have shown that RAS blockers and CCBs combinations are superior to
other combinations in lowering cardiovascular events, in addition to a better safety
profile.431,432 (Level 1)
9.3 Calcium Channel Blockers
• Consider ß-blocker as single first-line anti-hypertensive agent especially
when there are compelling indications for their use. (Grade A)
• Choose vasodilating over non-vasodilating ß-blockers as a preference.
However there had not been extensive head-to-head comparison between
ß-blockers. (Grade C)

Chapter 9. Types of Antihypertensive Agents
The RAS is implicated at all stages of the “CV continuum” that links hypertension
with other risk factors and major CV events. Therefore, it represents a rational and
established therapeutic target when lowering blood pressure.433
9.4.1 Ace Inhibitors (ACEIs)
ACEIs are effective antihypertensive agents which can lower cardiovascular risk,
reducing mortality and morbidity in hypertensives and those at high cardiovascular
risk.245,434 (Level 1) They are more effective in preventing coronary artery disease in
patients with hypertension.435 (Level 1) ACEIs are generally well tolerated and do not
have adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. Their safety profile is good.
ACEIs have also been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with
congestive heart failure436-438 (Level 1) and in post myocardial infarction patients with
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.439-444 (Level 1)

TABLE 9.4-A Recommended Dosing for ACEIs
In patients with established vascular disease but normal left ventricular function,
ACEIs reduce mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and new-onset congestive
heart failure.245
In the diabetic patient, ACEIs have been shown to reduce cardiovascular
mortality.155 (Level 1) These agents prevent the onset of microalbuminuria,
reduce proteinuria and retard progression of diabetic and non-diabetic renal
disease.445,446 (Level1)
Adverse effects include cough and, rarely, angioedema. In patients with renovascular
disease or renal impairment, deterioration in renal function may occur. Serum
creatinine and potassium should be checked before initiation and within 2 weeks
after starting. If there is hyperkalemia (>5.6 mmol/L) or a persistent rise of serum
creatinine of more than 30% from baseline within two months, the dose of the ACEI
should be reduced or discontinued.
This class of drug may increase foetal and neonatal mortality and therefore are
contraindicated in pregnancy and breast feeding. Counselling should be given to
women of child bearing age before initiation of RAS blockers. Pregnant patients
should seek immediate medical advice.
Combination Therapy with ACEI
The combination of an ACEI and a dihydropyridine CCB is preferred over the
combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in patients with hypertension and
high CV risk.84 (Level 1)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 9. Types of Antihypertensive Agents
9.4.2 Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
ARBs are drugs which specifically block angiotensin II receptors. Unlike ACEIs,
persistent dry cough is less and as such ARBs are recommended for risk reduction
in ACEI intolerant patients.447,448(Level 1)
ARBs are effective in preventing progression of diabetic nephropathy145,449(Level 1) and
may reduce the incidence of major cardiac events in patients with heart failure,450,451
(Level 1) hypertensive LVH452 (Level 1) and diastolic heart failure.213 (Level 1) In patients with LV
dysfunction post MI, ARBs have also been shown to be non-inferior to ACEIs.453 (Level 1)
The cardioprotective effects of ARBs when compared to ACEIs especially for
prevention of myocardial infarction, CV and all cause mortality were recently called
into question.454(Level 1) An earlier large meta-analysis of ARBs showed that although
it did not increase the risk of myocardial infarction compared to placebo or active
control, unlike ACEIs, it seem not to have special cardio protective effects.455 (Level 1) A
more recent meta-analysis however concluded that that ARBs do reduce CV events
including the risk of myocardial infarction.456 (Level 1)
Despite conflicting findings from various meta analyses, it is important to look at
the original studies, especially “head to head“ trials on these drugs. In high risk
CV patients with or without hypertension, the evidence showed that ARB is noninferior to ACEI for CV protection.457 (Level 1) However in patients with left ventricular
dysfunction, ACEI have more evidence including reducing mortality and ARB is
used for ACEI intolerant patients.451,458(Level 1) As for diabetics patients with or without
hypertension, ACEI improves CV outcome including total mortality especially in
combination with thiazide-like diuretics.83 (Level) The same is true for non-diabetic
nephropathy178(Level 1) and type 1 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy.140,141(Level 1)
However for type 2 diabetic nephropathy, both ACEI155(Level 1) and ARB144-146(Level 1)
improve renal outcome although only ACEI has the added advantage in improving
CV and renal outcomes. In hypertensives with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy, CV
protection (especially stroke reduction) have been demonstrated with ARB.112 (Level 1)
On the other hand for secondary stroke prevention, the evidence favour ACEI
especially in combination with thiazide-like diuretics.79(Level 1) Table 9.4-C summarises
the available evidence on the therapeutics of RAS blockers in patients with various
comorbidities.

9.5.1 The ∂-Blockers and the Combined ∂, ß-Blockers
The peripheral ∂1-adrenergic blockers lower BP by reducing peripheral resistance.
They also reduce prostatic and urethral smooth muscle tone and provide symptomatic
relief for patients with early benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).461 Unless there are
other compelling reasons, they should be the treatment of choice for hypertensive
patients with BPH. The use of non-specific ∂-blockers like phentolamine and
phenoxybenzamine has been restricted to the treatment of phaechromocytoma.
In addition, ∂-blockers have favourable effects on lipid metabolism. However
postural hypotension is a known side effect, especially at initiation of therapy.462,463
They should be used with care in the elderly.
Combined ∂ and ß-blockers offer enhanced neurohormonal blockade. Labetalol
has been in use for over 20 years and is safe in pregnancy (Refer to chapter 7.6 on
Hypertension in Pregnancy). The intravenous formulation is useful in hypertensive
emergencies, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.464
Carvedilol has been shown to be effective in hypertension and also to improve
mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure.465-467 (Level 1) In addition, it has no
adverse effects on insulin resistance and lipid metabolism.468 However, its safety in
pregnancy has not been established.

9.5.2 Centrally Acting Agents
The centrally acting agents available in this country are alpha-methyldopa, clonidine
and moxonidine. The common side effects of the centrally acting agents include
drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, dizziness and mood change. Moxonidine is less
likely to cause these reactions. The side-effects may decrease after a few weeks of
continued treatment. In general, treatment should begin with the lowest possible
dose to minimise the side-effects.
Alpha-methyldopa has been in use for many years. It is the drug of choice for
hypertension in pregnancy. It may be considered for resistant hypertension in
combination with other classes of anti-hypertensive agents.469
Clonidine should NOT be withdrawn suddenly because rebound hypertension may
occur.470 The use of clonidine is discouraged because safer and more potent drugs
are available.
Moxonidine is an orally administered imidazoline compound with selective agonist
activity at imidazoline II receptors. It can be used as monotherapy in patients with
mild to moderate hypertension or in combination with other anti-hypertensive
agents. Studies have suggested that it may improve the metabolic profile of
patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Rebound hypertension on
cessation of the drug is less likely compared to clonidine but abrupt withdrawal is
not recommended. It has been shown to increase mortality in patients with heart
failure and is therefore contraindicated in patients with heart failure or at risk of
heart failure.471

The only direct vasodilators available in Malaysia are hydralazine and minoxidil.
Hydralazine is only available in parenteral formulation for hypertensive emergencies.
Minoxidil may be considered for refractory hypertension. The usefulness of this
class of drugs is limited by their side-effects, including headache, compensatory
tachycardia, salt and water retention. Hirsutism is a troublesome side-effect with
long-term use of minoxidil. These drugs should only be prescribed by physicians
familiar with their usage.

9.5.4 Drugs In Development
As the pathophysiology of hypertension becomes clearer, compounds are being
developed to interrupt the pathways leading to an elevated blood pressure and to
normalise it.
Among the compounds being tested are:
1. Those targeting aldosterone (anti-aldosterone agents). The strategy is to either
block aldosterone production (aldosterone synthase inhibitors) or to block its
receptor (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).
The prototypes of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists would be
spironolactone and eplerenone. Finerenone is the latest in this class and is
currently undergoing phase III trials, not only for hypertension but also for
diabetic nephropathy and heart failure. Because it has low affinity for steroid
receptors, there is a lower incidence of gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction,
and reduced libido.
2. Those targeting the classical RAS. These would include angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 activators, angiotensin type 2 receptor agonists and vaccines against
the angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors.
3. Centrally acting aminopeptidase inhibitors to inhibit excessive sympathetic
outflow from the brain.
4. Vasopeptidase inhibitors which degrade natriuretic peptides.
5. Dual-acting angiotensin receptor–neprilysin Inhibitors. The combination of
valsartan and sacubitril is already in clinical use. However this combination has
found its niche in the management of heart failure rather than hypertension.

9.6.1 Traditional Medicine for Hypertension
In 2000, the WHO in a key paper, (http://who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/
definitions/en/) clearly outlined the definition and scope of traditional medicine as
follows:
Traditional medicine
Traditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based
on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether

explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention,
diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.
Complementary/alternative medicine (CAM)
The terms “complementary medicine” or “alternative medicine” are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set
of health care practices that are not part of that country’s own tradition and are not
integrated into the dominant health care system.
Herbal medicines
Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished
herbal products, that contain as active ingredients parts of plants, or other plant
materials, or combinations.
In most countries including Malaysia, the traditional treatment of hypertension will
consist of:
• oral, usually herbal medication
• various forms of relaxation exercises, including yoga and qigong
Herbs used in hypertension
There are few publications in the English literature on the treatment of hypertension
with herbs. The most quoted is by Tabassum and Ahmad473, the “Role of Natural
Herbs in the Treatment of Hypertension”. They comprehensively describe almost
50 herbal remedies for hypertension, including garlic, ginger, roselle, black plum,
mistletoe, wheat bran, cocoa, wild tomato, sesame, radish, pomegranate, basil, cork
wood, tomato, linseed, flaxseed, black mangrove, French lavender, pima cotton,
soybean, carrot, swamp or river lily, Chinese hawthorn, black bean, coffee weed,
tea, green oat, breadfruit, celery and prickly custard apple.
An extensive online review on Medscape474 showed that herbal medicines for
hypertension have not undergone the rigorous testing for efficacy and safety
that is expected of modern drugs. None have undergone the gold standard of
randomised placebo controlled trials. On top of that, there are reports that various
herbal preparations (usually in capsule form) have been adulterated with modern
drugs. For example, glibenclamide has been found in anti-diabetic preparations,
and sildenafil has been found in compounds to increase male virility. Corticosteroids
have also been added to traditional herbal medicine, with prolonged usage causing
Cushing’s Syndrome and hypertension. Hence, anecdotal reports on the efficacy of
certain herbs cannot be relied on.

Chapter 9. Types of Antihypertensive Agents
• There is no conclusive evidence that traditional medicine produces
sustained reductions in BP with good clinical outcomes.
• Traditional medicines are not recommended for the treatment of
hypertension.
SUMMARY
RECOMMENDATIONS
9.6.2 Relaxation Exercises for Hypertension
Since the 1970s there have been reports on the efficacy of yoga in the treatment of
hypertension (SBP -17 mmHg and DBP -10 mmHg). These trials, albeit small, have
been compared against a control group and are credible.64,475,476 Qigong has also
been demonstrated to lower the BP (SBP -17 mmHg and DBP -10 mmHg). But when
compared against conventional exercise there was no significant difference.477,478
The American Heart Association,479 in their Scientific Statement on Meditation and
Cardiovascular Risk Reduction, noted that BP may be lowered but the results were
variable and inconsistent.
The regimes are postulated to work by reducing excessive sympathetic outflow
from the brain, and in the case of qigong, to improve blood flow to various organs
in the body.
Relaxation regimes as part of a healthy living regime can be useful in the holistic
management of hypertension. Yoga and qigong or any other form of relaxation
exercises may usefully complement drug treatment.
• Relaxation therapy may complement non-pharmacological and
pharmacological treatment of hypertension however it is not
recommended as primary treatment for hypertension.
SUMMARY
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
10.1 Resistant Hypertension
Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled hypertension (>140/90 mmHg)
with good medication adherence while on three26,480 or four anti-hypertensive agents
(including a diuretic) in adequate doses. In a study of a primary care center involving 1,217
hypertensives in Malaysia, the prevalence of resistant hypertension (as defined above)
was reported to be 8.8%.481 Similar prevalence was observed in national surveys in the
United States (National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey from 2003-2008),
the estimated prevalence was 8.9%.482 It is however worth noting that the prevalence
may be an overestimate if white coat resistance is excluded. Ambulatory Blood Pressure
Monitoring studies on treatment resistant patients have demonstrated that between
30-35% of patients have pseudo resistant or office resistant hypertension.483 This is
consistent with a study from a tertiary center in Malaysia.484
Before labeling a patient as having resistant hypertension, it is
important that the practitioner ascertain that:
a. the patient adheres to medication (by definition at least 80%)
b. the blood pressure is measured appropriately
c. the patient does not have ‘office resistant hypertension’
d. an appropriate combination and dosage of drugs is prescribed, namely 3 drugs
including a RAS blocker, a CCB and a diuretic
e. the patient is not taking any substances which may antagonise the hypertensive
effects of the drugs taken (e.g. NSAID, sympathomimetics, liquorice, oral
contraceptives, corticosteroids)
It is therefore important that a thorough review of the patient’s history, physical
examination and investigations be done including estimation of renal function glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). A home or ambulatory blood pressure measurement should be
done to exclude isolated office hypertension. (Refer to chapter 2 on Measurement of
Blood Pressure).
Once a patient is confirmed to have true resistant hypertension, consider referral for
exclusion of secondary causes (Refer to chapter 3 on Diagnosis and Initial Assessment).
Resistant and Refractory Hypertension

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 10. Resistant and Refractory Hypertension
Excluding Secondary Hypertension
Although the prevalence of secondary hypertension is around 5%, its prevalence is
higher in patients with resistant hypertension. Depending on series, prevalence
of secondary hypertension among patients with resistant hypertension can be as
high as 66%, with obstructive sleep apnoea, accounting for most of it.485,486 In two
large series, primary aldosteronism was diagnosed in 11% of patients with resistant
hypertension.487,488 Subsequent investigations arranged should be guided by symptoms
present, examination findings elicited and results from preliminary investigations. It is
prudent that any investigations to be ordered or arranged must be rational with cost
effectiveness in mind.
Treatment options in resistant primary hypertension
a. Non-pharmacological Management
Non-pharmacological approaches (healthy living) must be re-emphasised. (Refer to
chapter 4 on Non-Pharmacological Management)
b. Pharmacological Management
A fourth drug should be added to the combination of RAS blocker, CCB and
diuretic. Two recent metaanalyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled
trials showed that spironolactone is superior to active controls (which includes alpha
blockers, ß-blockers, candesartan, frusemide or alpha methyldopa) in reducing
office, home and ambulatory blood pressures.489,490 (Level 1) These meta analyses of
disparate studies was strengthened by a multicenter randomised controlled double
blind trial which confirmed that spironolactone is the drug of choice as the fourth
drug in resistant hypertension.491 (Level 1)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Chapter 10. Resistant and Refractory Hypertension
• Treat patients with at least 3 drugs (inclusive of a diuretic) before diagnosing
resistant hypertension. (Grade C)
• Consider drug non-adherence and secondary hypertension before
diagnosing resistant hypertension. (Grade C)
• Add spironolactone as a fourth drug in resistant hypertension. (Grade A)
• Consider referring for device based therapy in patients with true resistant
and refractory hypertension. (Grade C)
RECOMMENDATIONS
10.2 Refractory Hypertension
The definition has been proposed to be used on patients whose BP are not controlled
after ≥5 antihypertensives.492
If blood pressures are still not controlled with four drugs, a fifth drug may be considered.
Subsequent therapeutic options include a ß-blocker, an alpha blocker or a centrally
acting drug. The prevalence of refractory hypertension among patients referred to a
specialty clinic for resistant hypertension was reported to be 2.7%489 in one series and
9.5% in another.493
Both resistant and refractory hypertensives are candidates for devise-based
intervention.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
Although the benefits of aspirin in secondary CV prevention is incontrovertible, that
for primary prevention remains controversial.494 A large meta analysis suggested that
for primary prevention, the risk of significant bleeding outweigh the benefits of CV
protection.495 In patients with hypertension a large RCT showed that low dose aspirin
(75 mg daily) reduced major CV events especially for MI but had no effect on the
incidence of stroke. Non-fatal major bleeds were however twice as common with
aspirin.299 Subgroup analysis of this large trial showed that patients who benefited most
are those with well treated hypertensive at higher baseline CV risk or higher baseline
BP. 299 The benefits of low dose aspirin were also most convincing in patients with well
controlled BP and moderate rise in serum creatinine (>114 umol/L).496
A recent large cohort study in Asia showed that aspirin given to uncomplicated
hypertensive patients for primary prevention significantly reduced all cause and
cardiovascular mortality.497 However, since it is associated with an increased risk of
major bleed, careful evaluation of risk/benefit analysis must be made by the doctor
before initiating aspirin.
Aspirin in Hypertension
11
• Consider using aspirin in patients with higher baseline BP. (Grade B)
• Treat patients BP to target first before initiating aspirin therapy. (Grade A)
RECOMMENDATIONS

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)
One of the potential approaches in treating true resistant hypertension and severe
newly diagnosed hypertension is device therapy. This includes renal denervation
therapy (RDN) and carotid sinus stimulation. In these patients, blood pressure rise is
initiated and sustained by sympathetic over activation498 and BP reduction can result
from its inhibition.499,500
Renal denervation therapy gained popularity following early blood pressure reduction
result seen in patients with resistant hypertension on medical therapy in the SIMPLICITY
HTN-1 and 2 trials. However, the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was not significantly
reduced. SIMPLICITY HTN-3, which had a sham control arm showed a neutral result
suggesting a lack of benefit with the single electrode radiofrequency catheter.501(Level 1)
Since 2014, several sham controlled randomised trials employing variations in improved
techniques (multi-electrode catheter, ultrasound and alcohol based denervation) have
been initiated. The recently published SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED examined the effect of
RDN in 80 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. They included patients with SBP
of 150-180 mmHg without any anti-hypertensive medications and found a significant
reduction (-5.5 mmHg for SBP) when compared to sham control at 3 months follow
up.502(Level II-1) This may suggest a potential for this intervention in newly diagnosed
hypertensives. Further confirmatory results from other trials are awaited to confirm the
clinical indication for multi-electrode RDN for newly diagnosed hypertension.503
Baroreceptor activation therapy (BAT) is based on sympathetic inhibition by carotid
sinus stimulation. The arterial stretch baroreceptors respond with a higher discharge
rate, to lower blood pressure, in the setting of rising blood pressure. In chronic
hypertension, this firing is blunted, rendering it less sensitive to respond to changes in
blood pressure.504 Carotid stimulation via surgical implantation of electrodes onto the
carotid bulbs have resulted in lowering the blood pressure.505 This invasive procedure is
still limited by technical, safety issues and cost.
Clinical development in this area should be accompanied by investigations identifying
predictors for good treatment response. Device based therapy should not be part of
routine medical care until further evidence is available.472,506

This latest CPG on hypertension has incorporated key references from research done
in Malaysia. It is also heartening to know that several multicentre international trials
cited in this CPG also had Malaysia as one of the centers involved. There are however a
few unanswered question unique to Malaysia which needed to be addressed in future
CPGs. It is suggested that Malaysian researchers should focus on these research areas
and funding authorities should give due importance to these areas of research.
