DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The Development Group for this Clinical Practice Guideline
(CPG) consisted of paediatric dental specialists, academics and
dental public health specialists. The Review Committee was
actively involved in the development process of this guideline.
The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Severe
Early Childhood Caries was first published in 2005 and since
then, there has been new evidence on diagnosis and
management of this condition. This revision aims to include
more target groups and give a greater emphasis on caries risk
assessment and prevention of early childhood caries. The key
elements of this revised CPG are improvements to the general
text, photographic updates, and simple messages based on upto-date evidence and treatment approaches.
Literature search was carried out at the following electronic
databases: PUBMED/MEDLINE, SUMSearch, Trip Database,
Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR), Journal full
text via OVID search engine and Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE). The following free text terms
or MeSH terms were used either singly or in combination to
retrieve the articles: tooth, dental, decay, caries, rampant,
bottle, nursing, baby and child. All searches were conducted
between March 2010 and August 2011 and only literatures in
English were retrieved. In addition, reference was also made to
other guidelines on Early Childhood Caries e.g. American
Academy of Paediatric Dentistry 2009, European Academy of
Paediatric Dentistry 2008 and Scottish Dental Clinical
Effectiveness Programme. These CPGs were evaluated using
the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation
(AGREE) prior to them being used as references.
This CPG is largely based on the findings of systematic
reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials. The levels of
evidence of the literature were graded using the adapted
version of United States/Canadian Preventive Services Task
Force
Level
of
Evidence,
while
the
grading
of
recommendations was based on the modified version of the
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).
Clinical questions were developed under six major subtopics
and members of the review group were assigned individual
questions within these subtopics. Relevant literature retrieved
were appraised by at least two members and presented in the
form of evidence tables and discussed during review group
meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated
were agreed by the review group and where evidence was
insufficient;
recommendations
were
made
based
on
consensus of the group members.
Although, ideally patient views and preferences should be
considered in the development of CPGs, in this instance, it was
not considered feasible. Nevertheless, patient information
leaflets would be developed to facilitate the dissemination of
important information to the public.
The draft guidelines were reviewed by a team of external
reviewers and posted on the Ministry of Health, Malaysia
website for comments and feedbacks. These guidelines were
presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and
finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry of Health,
Malaysia for approval

GLOSSARY
Dental caries
Destruction of tooth structure caused by acid
produced by bacteria.
Active caries
Carious lesion which is progressing and is
characterized by chalky white appearance of
enamel and yellow coloured soft dentine.
Arrested caries
Carious lesion that is no longer progressive.
Yellow, brown to dark brown enamel lesion
that is hard to probing.
Incipient caries
Early stage of carious lesion, best seen on the
smooth surface of teeth, visible as a white
spot.
Severe early
childhood caries
Any sign of dental caries on any tooth surface
during the first 3 years of life. The decay
pattern usually involves the deciduous upper
maxillary tooth and the upper and lower
deciduous molars. The lesions are usually
suddenly appearing, widespread and rapidly
involve the tooth pulp.
Decayed/missing/
filled teeth
(dmf)
dmf describes the amount or prevalence of
dental caries in an individual
(d - decayed , m - missing, f – filled,)
The sum of the three figures forms the dmfvalue which numerically expresses the caries
prevalence. For example: dmf of 4, 3, 9 =16
means that 4 teeth are decayed, 3 teeth are
missing and 9 teeth have fillings.
1. INTRODUCTION
Dental caries is a biofilm (plaque)-induced acid demineralisation
of enamel or dentine, mediated by saliva.1
level
III The
development of the carious lesion is episodic, with periods of
demineralisation alternating with periods of remineralisation.
1.1
Early Childhood Caries (ECC)
Dental caries in children is typically first observed clinically as a
“white spot lesion.” If the tooth surface remains intact and noncavitated, then remineralisation of the enamel is possible. If the
subsurface demineralisation of enamel is extensive, it
eventually causes the collapse of the overlying tooth surface,
resulting in a “cavity”. The disease, ECC is referred to the
presence of 1 or more decayed (non-cavitated or cavitated
lesions), missing (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces in a
child under the age of 6. In children younger than 3 years of
age, any sign of smooth surface caries is indicative of severe
Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC).2 level lll From ages 3 to 5, the
severity of ECC can be classified according to dmf scores
(Table 1).

1.2
Severe Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC)
S-ECC describes dental caries in the primary dentition of young
children that occur abruptly, spreading widely and rapidly and is
burrowing in nature resulting in early involvement of the dental
pulp. It has also been referred to as rampant caries, nursing
bottle caries and baby bottle tooth decay. Consequences of
S-ECC include a higher risk of new carious lesions,3-6 level ll-2
hospitalizations and emergency room visits7-10 level lll, increased
treatment cost and time,11-12 level lll risk for delayed physical
growth and physical development,13-14 level ll-1 loss of school days
and increased days with restricted activity15-17 level ll-2 and a
diminished ability to learn.18-20 level ll-3 Oral health-related quality
of life (QOL) has also been shown to be significantly correlated
with ECC; children with ECC had significantly worse oral healthrelated QOL than caries free children.21 level ll-2
1.3 Epidemiology
Epidemiologic data in Malaysia indicates that ECC continues to
be a major challenge. Caries prevalence among 6-year olds
remains high, with only a small decline from 80.9% in 1997 to
74.5% in 2007.22 level ll-2 Among 5 year olds, the caries
prevalence was 76.2% with a mean decayed, missing, and filled
teeth (dmft) score of 5.6. About 55.8% of 5 year-olds had 3 or
more deciduous teeth affected by caries whilst 25.3% had dmft
≥10.23 level ll-2
In the US, national surveys show that ECC was highly prevalent
and increasing among poor preschool children and was largely
untreated in children under age 3. Those children with caries
experience have been shown to have high numbers of teeth
affected.24 level lll Similarly, in the UK, sizable groups of 5-year-old
children have clinically significant ECC. In general, although
overall caries prevalence is decreasing, the disease level in preschool children has not decreased consistently. Significant
groups within the population remain in need of oral healthcare.25
level lll
1.4
Clinical Characteristics
The clinical pattern of ECC is rampant.2 Level lll Characteristically,
caries usually affect the primary teeth in the following sequence:
Maxillary central incisors → Maxillary lateral incisors →
Maxillary 1st molars → Maxillary canines and second molars →
Mandibular molars → Mandibular canines and incisors (Table 2
and Fig 1- Fig 3a - d).

2. CARIES RISK
Dental caries is a transmissible infectious disease and
understanding the acquisition of cariogenic microbes improves
preventive strategies. Certain risk factors, behaviours or habits
that give cause for prolonged presence of fermentable cariogenic
substrates, or a high oral cariogenic bacterial count may cause
the child to be at risk for dental decay.
2.1
Risk Factors
The causes of caries are multi-factorial, and the individual risk
factors associated with ECC are therefore not necessarily
causative. The Fisher-Owen diagram26 Level III (Fig 4) summarizes
the complicated interaction between oral health influenced by
environment at child, family and community levels.
Fig 4. Child, family, and community influences on oral health
outcomes of children (Fisher-Owens).
The following is a list of some of the major factors
i.
Dietary Habits
High frequency consumption of sugary foods and drinks are
risk indicators for caries.27-28 level l
ii.
Bottle feeding
Frequent bottle feeding with sucrose-containing infant feed,
especially night time, is a risk indicator for caries in young
children.29 level lll
iii.
Socio economic status
Children who live under poor economic circumstances,
belong to ethnic and racial minorities, have single mothers
and parents with low education have increased prevalence
to ECC.30 level lll
iv.
Mutans Streptococci (MS)
MS maybe transmitted vertically from mother to child
through salivary contact. Infants with high levels of MS or
those with early colonization are more likely to develop
ECC.31-33 level l Children whose mothers have good oral
hygiene have a lower risk of maternal transmission of
Mutans Streptococci (MS) and childhood dental caries.
v.
Plaque
Visible plaque is strongly associated with ECC. Highest
incidence of caries was found among children who did not
brush their teeth.34 level ll-2
vi.
Early Caries Experience
Children with early caries development exhibit high caries
progression as well as a high risk for further development of
an extensive number of new carious lesions.35 level ll-2
2.2
Protective Factors
These are factors that can help arrest or reverse dental caries.
i. Breast feeding
Breast feeding provides the best nutrition for babies.36 level l
There is no effect of breast feeding on early childhood
caries.37 level
ii. Fluorides
Children living in a fluoridated community or have exposure to
fluoridated toothpaste have lower risk of dental caries.38-39 level l
iii. Regular dental care
Children with regular dental care have lower caries risk.40 level II-3
2.3
Caries Risk Assessment
Effective dental care requires early identification of children at
high risk for dental caries, so that they may receive early and
intensive intervention. The goal of caries risk assessment is to
deliver patient-specific diagnostic, preventive, and restorative
services – based on the needs of each individual child.
Conducting caries risk assessment can potentially identify those
at risk even before manifestation of carious lesions.41 level ll-3
The risk factors are assessed by an interview with the parent
and clinical examination of the child. A risk assessment
categorisation of low, moderate or high is based on a
preponderance of the risk factors.
(Refer to Appendix I for Caries-risk Assessment Form for 0 – 3
Year Olds and Appendix II for Caries-risk Assessment Form for 0 –
5 Year Olds)
RECOMMENDATION
 Caries risk assessment should be done for all infants and
young children for early identification and treatment planning
(Refer Appendix 1 & 2)
Grade A
3.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of early childhood caries is both by visual and clinical
examination of children who are at risk.
3.1
Visual and Clinical Examination
Reliable clinical diagnosis and recording of carious lesions and
restorations can be achieved if the teeth are clean and dry. The
initial appearance of ECC is the presence of opaque white
spots which usually starts at the cervical third of upper anterior
teeth. It could then affect the occlusal of upper deciduous
molars, upper canines followed by lower deciduous molars,
lower canines and lower incisors progressing into yellowish
brown carious lesions.41 level ll-3 In advanced S-ECC, the lesion
may progress to expose pulp tissue and breakdown as retained
roots.
A full mouth clinical examination is carried out by a thorough
visual examination with a good light source and a dry field. If
there is any gross plaque deposit, they should be removed by
wiping the surface with gauze. Dental examinations by visual
inspection with the aid of plane mouth mirrors are the most
useful for diagnosing carious lesions. Probing is not an
acceptable method for diagnosing caries in pits and fissure, but
may be useful when assessing caries activity in exposed
dentine. Diagnosing gross caries in children with conventional
methods such as visual and tactile examination is usually
sufficient.42-43 level l
3.2
Radiographic Examination
The broad contact points of the primary dentition make
diagnosis of approximal caries difficult. Therefore, bitewing
radiographs (Fig.5) are an important adjunct in detecting
proximal caries for children age four and above.44-45 level lll If a
child is uncooperative for bitewings, a bi-maxillary oblique
lateral view may be obtained. Orthopantomograms are not
routinely used for caries diagnosis.
Fig 5. Bitewing radiographs
3.3
Other Investigations
Although salivary flow rate and salivary buffering capacity are
said to influence the development of dental decay, it is not
recommended to routinely investigate this in the diagnosis of
ECC.
Typical clinical presentation of S-ECC can alert the parents,
caregivers and other health personnel during their regular
contact within the non-dental setting. Lift the lip technique
should be done once a month at home to look for early signs of
tooth decay on the surfaces of upper front teeth.46 level lll
4.
PREVENTION
The aims of prevention are targeted at a) early identification of
patients who are at risk of ECC so that preventive measures
can be instituted, b) preventing the progression of dental caries
in children who are diagnosed with S-ECC and c) preventing
the recurrence of dental caries in children who have been
diagnosed with severe ECC.
The prevention of S-ECC requires a multi-factorial approach
due to its various etiological factors as summarized below:
i.
Good dietary practice guidelines should be given to
new mothers to prevent ECC.47 level I
RECOMMENDATION

Lift the lip once a month to look for early signs of decay on the
surfaces of upper front teeth

Dental examination should be carried out by visual inspection
with the aid of plane mouth mirrors to identify caries
Grade A
ii.
Healthcare workers must prescribe sugar-free liquid
medicines whenever appropriate.48 level lll
iii.
Toothpastes with fluoride concentration of 1000 ppm
and above are efficacious in preventing caries.
Children under 3 years should use a smear of
toothpaste whilst those aged 3-6 years should use a
pea sized amount of toothpaste.49-50 level I,
iv.
For high risk young children, a small amount of resin
based fluoride varnish can be applied at intervals of 3
months or 6 months.51 level Ill
v.
Reinforce oral hygiene measures to reduce plaque and
transmission of cariogenic bacteria.52 level I
vi.
Collaboration with parents and other healthcare
providers to ensure all infants and toddlers have
access
to
dental
screenings,
counseling,
and
preventive procedures.53 level I
vii.
Encourage early dental visits within 6 months of
eruption of the first tooth and no later than 12 months
of age to conduct a caries risk assessment which can
potentially
indicate
those
at
risk
even
before
manifestation of carious lesions.40 level ll-3
viii.
Children with special healthcare needs should be
referred to a dental practitioner upon diagnosis in order
that early diagnosis and preventive measures may be
instituted.54 level llI

MANAGEMEN
5.
MANAGEMENT
The management of S-ECC is affected by the extent of the
carious lesions and the compliance of the child and parent.
5.1
Control of the Carious Process
An individualized caries risk assessment is the first important
step in the management of S-ECC. It aims to modify the risk
factors as discussed in the previous section.
Parents should be asked to wean off the child from using a
bottle while in bed. In case of considerable emotional
dependence on the bottle, suggest the use of plain water. In
addition, parents are instructed to brush child’s teeth last thing
at night with fluoride toothpaste.49 level I For children aged 3-6
RECOMMENDATION

Maintenance of good dietary practices, good oral hygiene
control as well as the use of fluoridated toothpaste are
recommended for prevention of ECC
Grade A
years, chair-side topical fluoride varnish (2.2% F) application to
teeth (Fig 6) should be carried out twice yearly.55 level I
Fig 6. Fluoride Varnish Application
5.2
Stabilization of carious lesions
The second stage of management would involve stabilization of
lesions. If the carious lesion is arrested, it should be monitored
to ascertain that it remains in non-progressive stage until
exfoliation.56 level lI-2 For non-cavitated proximal enamel lesions, a
resin infiltration system used in conjunction with fluoride can be
used to control caries progression on deciduous molar teeth.57
level II-1
Teeth that require temporization are excavated with spoon
excavators and glass ionomer cement (Fig.7) is used to seal
the teeth. Temporization by sealing of the carious cavity after
caries removal reduces the load of bacterial colonization in
tooth.58 level l
Fig. 7 Caries Stabilization with Glass Ionomer Cement
When undertaking temporization, evidence shows of that
sealing of partially excavated dentine caries is capable of
arresting lesion progression, suggesting that complete dentine
caries removal is not essential to control caries progression.59
level II-2
5.3
Restorative Treatment
Restorative treatment of ECC is based on removal of caries
and
the
treatment
approach
taken
should
take
into
consideration the child’s risk factors and age.60 level lll In addition,
the choice of restorative material used can be influenced by a)
site and extent of decay b) child’s ability to cooperate c)
longevity of the restoration.61 level III
The most commonly used materials used in restoring primary
teeth are described in the table below.

There are no significant differences in the materials for
outcomes as there are not enough clinical trials to support any
particular material.63 level I However, studies on longevities of
restorations tend to favour SSC64 level lll and amalgam over the
resin based materials.65 level ll In young children with high risk of
caries, there is good evidence that stainless steel crowns
(Fig.8) function better than multi-surface intra-oral restorations.

Alternatively, the Hall technique, a simplified method of
managing carious primary molars using preformed metal
crowns cemented with no local anaesthesia, caries removal or
tooth preparation has showed favourable outcomes for pulp
health and restoration longevity than conventional restorations.

5.4
Extraction
For teeth that are pulpally involved, the clinician may decide to
conduct endodontic treatment or extraction. Extraction of
primary teeth is one of the treatment options in managing
children with S-ECC although the clinician should try to avoid
dental extractions during the child’s first visit. The decision to
extract should only be made after considering both general and
local factors below.68 level lll

of the dentition - balancing and compensating extractions
may be considered
5.5
Treatment under General Anaesthesia
If the child is unable to be compliant during dental treatment, or
if the child requires extensive treatment, then the use of general
anaesthesia (GA) may be considered. Outcome of treatments
related to quality of the restorations performed under GA are
better than sedation for all parameters examined.69 level II-3
Evidence suggests that comprehensive treatment appears to
reduce the bacterial load within the oral cavity and full mouth
rehabilitation under general anaesthesia (Fig.9) produced a
statistically significant decrease in MS levels for at least three
months.70
level
II-3 Oral rehabilitation coupled with regular
application of 10% povidone iodine application can be a good
alternative to control dental caries in children affected with
ECC.71 level l
Fig.9 Comprehensive Dental Treatment under General Anaesthesia
5.6
Prognosis
Aggressive dental surgery for ECC does not always result in
acceptable clinical outcomes as there is still risk for relapse.72
level II-2 Despite aggressive treatment of ECC, studies have
shown some patients do develop new carious lesions within 2
years.73-74 level III It has also been shown that patients who fail to
attend their immediate follow-up appointments may be more
likely to experience a relapse.
RECOMMENDATION

Active carious lesion should be temporized with Glass Ionomer
Cement to control caries progression

For children with high caries risk or multi-surface lesions, the
use of stainless steel crowns is recommended.

Non compliant children with S-ECC should be managed with
comprehensive treatment under general anesthesia
Grade B
5.7
Recall and Follow-Up
Children with S-ECC must be reviewed to detect any changes.
Recall intervals are based on the outcome of their caries risk
assessment:

Children with obvious signs of active oral disease or its
predisposing factors should be reviewed at 3 monthly
intervals until well controlled
Recall visit of high caries risk children should be based on the
clinician’s assessment of the child’s caries risk status using the
Caries Risk Assessment checklist, and should not exceed 12
months.75 level III
6.
IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
This section provides advice on the resource implications
associated with implementing the key recommendations and
advice on proposed clinical audit indicators for quality
management to aid implementation.
RECOMMENDATION

Children with S-ECC must be recalled according to intervals
based on the outcome of their caries risk status
Grade A
Implementation of these CPG is an essential part of clinical
governance. It should cater to the local health clinics and
community based on both economic and non-economic
considerations. Mechanisms should be in place to review the
existing healthcare system as compared to the CPG
recommendations. Any differences should be assessed and
addressed appropriately.
Important issues that should be considered when implementing
these CPG are:

Establishment
of
an
early
childhood
oral
health
programme

Adequate training of healthcare providers, parents and
carers to identify S-ECC

Coordinated referral system and availability of resources
for necessary treatment
6.1
Existing
facilitators
and
barriers
in
applying
recommendations
The implementation of the CPG will be facilitated by
strengthening
the
existing
early
childhood
oral
health
programme and focusing on the CPG Training module for
healthcare providers, parents and carers. The module involves
the training of Maternal and Child Health Nurses, Medical
Officers, assistant medical officers and Paediatricians. The
development group will ensure that the contents of the training
module will be in tandem with the recommendations in the
CPG.
There are 3 barriers in applying recommendations of the CPG
in the local context:
1.
Patient factors

Lack
of
awareness
of
the
possible
problems
associated with S-ECC as they are thought of as
“temporary teeth”
2.
Healthcare professional factors

Limited human resources, especially dental nurses
who are multi-tasking

Difficulty in the management of very young children

Limited knowledge among non-dental healthcare
providers
3. Health services factors

Lack of linkages between services and providers
With the availability of these evidence based CPGs, the
current management will be strengthened to reduce the
occurrence of S-ECC.
6.2
Potential
resource
implications
in
applying
recommendations
In
implementing
the
CPG,
the
development
group
recommends strengthening of the existing training module on
management of S-ECC. Adequate human resource, especially
dental nurses are required.
The development group proposes the following clinical audit
indicator
for
quality
management
to
ensure
the
implementation of recommendations in the CPG:
% of patients
who develop
new caries*
within 6
months of
completion of
treatment
No of patients who develop new caries within 6
months of completion of treatment x 100%
x
100
No of patients diagnosed with ECC / S-ECC in that
centre and treated in that centre (i.e., not to include
patients referred to specialist)
* new caries: caries on a new surface of a tooth or caries in a
tooth which was not previously carious
# completion of treatment: caries arrested and all conservative
treatment provided
