STATEMENT OF INTENT
This guideline was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the
management of dyslipidaemia, based on the best available evidence at the time of
development. Specific attempts were made to use local data and publications to
ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not necessarily lead to the
best clinical outcome in individual patient care. Every health care provider is
responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical
presentation and management options available locally.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE
This guideline is issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in about 5 years or earlier if
important new evidence becomes available.

This is an update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines on Management of
Dyslipidaemia published in 2011. This CPG supersedes the previous CPG.
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH
Dyslipidaemia remains a significant problem in Malaysia, with the
National Health and Morbidity survey in 2015 reporting an estimated
47% of the adult population having hypercholesterolaemia. In the
main, dyslipidaemia is asymptomatic but its associations with serious
vascular conditions such as acute myocardial infarction and stroke is
well known.
The previous edition of the National Clinical Practice Guidelines
(CPGs) were launched in 2011. Since then, the evidence base on this
subject has grown and new treatments now available. In addition,
more clinical information on dyslipidaemia has emerged from Malaysia and the region.
Therefore, this edition, which is the 5th Edition of the CPG on the Management of Dyslipidaemia,
is timely.
Accessing this CPG, and others endorsed by the Ministry of Health, by healthcare providers is
now easier, with the advent of modern telecommunications – downloading a soft copy of this
CPG should be a seamless affair. I anticipate the readership of this and other such CPGs to grow
and the information provided be useful for healthcare providers in their day to day management
of patients.
I would like to congratulate the multidisciplinary team for working together for many months to
produce this CPG. Members of the this CPG Expert Panel consist of experts from both the
private and public sectors, from primary to tertiary care centres, and from across the country.
Under the capable and enthusiastic leadership of Dr Robaayah Zambahari, supported by Dr
Jeyamalar Rajadurai, the Expert Panel regularly met to ensure the most recent and relevant
information are incorporated into this CPG. I also thank members of the Panel of External
Reviewers for their efforts.
Finally, I hope elements of this CPG will be put into practice on a daily basis, to tackle the
problem of dyslipidaemia in this country, and eventually result in a drop in mortality and morbidity
associated with vascular disease. I am sure this 5th Edition of the CPG on the Management of
Dyslipidaemia (2017) will go a long way towards achieving this.

RATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT
Rationale:
In Malaysia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in both men
and women1. CVD includes coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease
and peripheral arterial disease. CHD is a spectrum ranging from stable angina to
acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
The prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors – dyslipidaemia,
hypertension, diabetes, smoking and overweight/obesity have been on an
increasing trend. Malaysians develop heart disease (ACS) at a younger age when
compared to people in Thailand, mainland China and western countries. Our local
NCVD-ACS Registry (2011-2013), showed that most patients (96.8%) had at least
one established CV risk factor – hypertension (65%), dyslipidaemia (37%) and/or
diabetes (46%)2.
In preventing CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global risks. This Clinical
Practice Guideline (CPG) is on management of dyslipidaemia. The last CPG (4th
edition) was published in 2011. Thus the need for an update.
Objectives:
The objective of this clinical practice guideline is to review:
•
The
clinical
evidence
linking
dyslipidaemia
and
atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis affects the entire vascular tree. However, evidence for a causal
link is strongest for CVD (heart disease and strokes).
•
Strategies for assessing CV risk that is most applicable to our local
population.
•
Evidence based management of dyslipidaemia, utilising existing healthcare
resources wherever possible.
Process:
This CPG has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart
Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health and the Academy of Medicine. It
comprises cardiologists, endocrinologists, general physicians, pharmacists and
dieticians from the government and private sectors as well as from the Universities.
Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases – PubMed
and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. The following MeSH terms
or free text terms were used either singly or in combination:
“Hyperlipidaemia”; “Dyslipidaemia”; “Hypercholesterolemia”; “Cholesterol”;
“LDL-cholesterol” “HDL-cholesterol”; “Triglycerides”; Diabetic dyslipidaemia”
2017
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
The search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and
published in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from
this huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were
searched to identify further studies. The search was conducted from August
2010 (date of last review for previous CPG) till 31st August 2016.
Local guidelines were also studied. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain
further information. International guidelines mainly that from the American Heart
Association/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the European
Society of Cardiology were used as main references.
After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up by the members of the Expert
Panel and submitted to the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice
Guidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and key health personnel in the major
hospitals of the Ministry of Health and the Private Sector for review and feedback.
The clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of the Expert
Panel were assigned individual topics. The group members met several times
throughout the development of the guideline. All retrieved literature was appraised
by individual members and subsequently presented for discussion during group
meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively
by members of the Expert Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient the
recommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. The draft was then sent
to local external reviewers for comments. It was also sent to the American College of
Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology for feedback.
The level of recommendation and the grading of evidence used in this guideline was
adapted from the American Heart Association and the European Society of
Cardiology (ACC/ESC) and outlined on page 10. In the text, this is written in black
on the left hand margin.
Clinical Questions Addressed:
There were several topics and subtopics that were formulated using the PICO
method, addressing diagnosis and therapy of dyslipidaemia.
For diagnosis:
• Does measuring the lipid profile in the fasting as compared to the
non-fasting state, result in a significant difference in the measured values?
• Does measuring the lipid profile in the fasting as compared to the
non-fasting state, have an impact on cardiovascular risk estimation?

For therapy, the topics and subtopics were as follows:
P: Population- Persons

With heart disease (secondary prevention)

Without heart disease (primary prevention)

With diabetes
o Type 2 diabetes
o Type 1 diabetes

With Chronic Kidney Disease
o Not on renal replacement therapy
 With co-existing cardiovascular disease
 Without co–existing cardiovascular disease
o On renal replacement therapy
 Co-existing cardiovascular disease
 Without co–existing cardiovascular disease

With Heart Failure
o With co-existing cardiovascular disease
o Without co–existing cardiovascular disease ( dilated cardiomyopathy)

With Specific Lipid Disorders
o High TG
 With co-existing cardiovascular disease
 Without co–existing cardiovascular disease
o Low HDL-C
 With co-existing cardiovascular disease
 Without co–existing cardiovascular disease
 Elderly
 Women
 Children and adolescents
I: Intervention:
 Total and LDL-Cholesterol lowering
 HDL-Cholesterol raising
 Triglyceride lowering
C: Comparison:
 Therapeutic lifestyle intervention vs placebo
 Pharmacological therapy vs lifestyle intervention
O: Outcome:
 Reduction in Cardiovascular Disease- Events, vascular mortality
 Reduction in All cause mortality
Edition of

th
Type of Question- Involves:
 Therapy – Lipid lowering
 Harm – Increase in Cardiovascular Event Rate, Adverse effects due to
Lipid lowering and/or Pharmacotherapy
 Prognosis – Cardiovascular Risk Reduction
 Prevention of Cardiovsacular Disease
Type of Study
 Systematic review and meta analysis
 Randomised Controlled Studies
 Cohort studies
Thus, there were numerous clinical questions formulated.
Examples of some of these Clinical Questions:
• In persons with heart disease, does Total and LDL-Cholesterol
lowering with therapeutic lifestyle interventions alone lead to a
reduction in cardiovascular event rate and cardiovascular mortality?
• In persons with heart disease, does Total and LDL-Cholesterol
lowering with pharmacotherapy with statins lead to a reduction
in cardiovascular event rate and cardiovascular mortality?
• In persons without heart disease, does Total and LDL-Cholesterol
lowering with pharmacotherapy with statins lead to an increase in
cardiovascular event rate and/or an increase in adverse effects?
The additional question was:
• How to assess CV risk and risk stratify our local population?
Target Group:
This guideline is directed at all healthcare providers involved in the management of
dyslipidaemia – general practitioners, medical officers, pharmacists, general and
family physician, cardiologists and endocrinologists.
Target Population:
Individuals with and without cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes, Chronic
Kidney Disease, Heart Failure, Specific Lipid Disorders, Elderly, Women, Children
and adolescents.
Period of Validity of the Guidelines:
This guidelines needs to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with
recent developments and knowledge that is being learnt.
Applicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:
This guideline was developed taking into account our local health resources. Blood
chemistry for lipid profiles, liver and renal function tests can be done in all
government health facilities. Almost all the medications recommended (except for
the PCSK9 inhibitors) are approved for use in Malaysia and available in public
hospitals as generics.
This guideline aims to educate health care professional on strategies to optimize
existing resources in the management of dyslipidaemia.
Facilitators and Barriers:
The main barrier for successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of knowledge
of the:
•
role of cholesterol (especially LDL-Cholesterol) in the pathogenesis of
cardiovascular disease
•
benefits of total cholesterol (especially LDL-Cholesterol) lowering
•
safety profile of pharmacotherapy
Implementation of the Guidelines:
The implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical
governance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:
•
Increasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the
importance of knowing their individual CV risk.
•
Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on CV
risk assessment tools and the implementation of appropriate preventative
strategies depending on each individual’s CV risk status. This can be done
byroad shows, electronic media, and in house training sessions.
Clinical audit by individual hospitals, units and general practices to ensure
compliance using the suggested performance measures in Section 13, pg. 80.

SUMMARY
•
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death in
Malaysia for over a decade.
•
The common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors - dyslipidaemia, hypertension,
diabetes, smoking, overweight/obesity – are on an increasing trend.
•
Dyslipidaemia has been well established as a CV risk factor. It refers to the
following lipid levels:
 Total cholesterol (TC) > 5.2 mmol/L
 High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 1.0 mmol/L (males)
< 1.2 mmol/L (females)
 Triglycerides (TG) > 1.7 mmol/L
 Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels - will depend on
the patient’s CV risk - Table 4 & 5, pg. 20
•
Numerous randomized clinical trials have consistently shown that reducing TC
and LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces vascular risk and prevents CVD.
•
LDL-C is the primary target of therapy.
•
Non-HDL-Cholesterol may be considered as a secondary target when treating
individuals with:
 combined hyperlipidaemias
 diabetes
 metabolic syndrome
 chronic kidney disease
•
In measuring lipid levels:
 A standard lipid profile includes measurement of plasma or serum TC,
LDL-C, HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG).
 LDL-C is usually calculated by the Freidewald equation which is not valid in
the presence of elevated TG (TG > 4.5 mmol/L).
 Both fasting and non-fasting samples may be used for lipid screening.
•
Dyslipidaemias may be primary or secondary to nephrotic syndrome,
obstructive liver disease, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, drugs,
alcoholism and insulin resistance states such as T2DM and metabolic
syndrome. Treatment of the underlying aetiology can lead to an improvement
in the lipid profile.
•
In management, the global CV risk of the individual should first be assessed.
(Table 4, pg. 20)
 Patients with established CVD, CKD and diabetes fall into the Very High
and High Risk Categories.
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
SUMMARY
 All other individuals should be risk stratified at the outset using the
Framingham General CVD risk score to determine if they are at High,
Intermediate (Moderate) or Low Risk. (Table 1 & 2 pg. 17 & 18) or online
at https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk-functions/cardiovascular-
disease/10-year-risk.php
•
The intensity of risk factor reduction and target lipid levels will depend on the
individual’s CV risk. (Table 4 & 5, pg. 20)
•
Therapeutic lifestyle changes i.e. adhering to a healthy diet, regular exercise,
avoidance of tobacco smoking and maintenance of an ideal weight, remain a
critical component of health promotion and CVD risk reduction. (Table 6, pg
21)
•
The amount of CV risk reduction seen will depend on the absolute risk of the
individual and the degree of LDL-C lowering that is achieved (level of LDL-C
achieved and/or the percentage reduction).
•
Statin treatment has been clearly documented to reduce CV events in all age
groups and irrespective of the baseline LDL-C. (Table 7, pg. 22)
•
An achieved on-treatment LDL-C level of < 1.8 mmol/L appears to significantly
slow down progression of atherosclerosis.
•
Lower levels of LDL-C have been shown to be associated with atherosclerotic
regression.
•
In most individuals at Low and Intermediate (Moderate) risk, therapeutic
lifestyle changes alone should suffice. Occasionally drug therapy may be
necessary to achieve target lipid levels. Only statins have been studied in these
individuals.
•
In individuals at Very High and High CV risk, drug therapy with statins should
be initiated at the outset in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle changes.
•
In patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and combined
hyperlipidaemias, the primary target of therapy is still LDL-C – the target level
will depend on the individual’s CV risk. (Table 5, pg. 20)

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of mortality in both
Malaysian men and women for more than a decade1,5. CVD includes coronary heart
disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease (strokes) and peripheral arterial disease
(PAD).
According to the National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS) the prevalence of
the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors among adults ≥ 18 years had been on
an increasing trend.6–8 (Table 8, pg. 24). The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia
had risen by 46% over the 4 years, 2011 – 20157,8. Almost 1 in 5 adults in the 18-19
year age group had hypercholesterolemia.8 The prevalence increased with age, from
22.0% in the 18-19 year age group, reaching a peak of 68.8% among adults aged
55-59 years. The prevalence was the same in both rural and urban areas. A similar
survey carried out recently among 13-year old students from both urban and rural
public schools, found that almost 23% of them had total cholesterol >5.2
mmol/L.9
Although atherosclerosis affects the entire vascular tree- coronary, cerebral and
peripheral vessels- the causal link between hypercholesterolemia and CVD (heart
disease and strokes) has been most well established. (Section 4, pg. 30).
Data from the National Cardiovascular Disease – Acute Coronary Syndrome
(NCVD-ACS) Registry 2011-2013, indicated that Malaysians developed acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) at a younger age than that seen in neighbouring
countries.2 The mean age was 58.5 years and the peak incidence was in the 51-60
year age group.2 This is younger than that noted in Thailand (63.5 years)10 and
Singapore (median: 68.3-69.2 years).11 About 6.6% of our patients admitted with
ACS were <40 years2.
In the prevention of CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global risks. This
guidelines emphasize:
•
A multifactorial approach that addresses all risk factors. This is because the
benefits of modifying several risk factors simultaneously are synergistic.
•
That preventing CVD should be directed at global CVD burden rather than CHD
alone.
There already exists clinical practice guidelines (CPG) addressing specific CV risk
factors. The objectives of this CPG on the Management of Dyslipidaemia are to:
•
Critically review the role of dyslipidaemia as a CV risk factor.
2017
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
•
Provide treatment strategies for managing dyslipidaemia, utilising and
optimising existing health resources, in the following:
 High risk individuals – these include those who have established CVD,
diabetes, multiple CV risk factors and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (ie
secondary prevention).
 Individuals who are otherwise healthy (ie primary prevention).
•
Provide strategies for the successful implementation and dissemination of the
recommendations.
Dyslipidaemia refers to the following lipid levels:
•
Total cholesterol (TC) > 5.2 mmol/L
•
HDL-C < 1.0 mmol/L (males) < 1.2 mmol/L (females)
•
TG > 1.7 mmol/L
•
LDL-C levels - will depend on the patient’s CV risk - Table 4 & 5, pg. 20
Decision making however, should be individualised and based on sound clinical
judgement.
Table 8: Prevalence of Cardiovascular Risk Factors Among Adults > 18 Years
of Age in Malaysia
Key Message:
•
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of morbidity and
mortality in both Malaysian men and women for more than a decade.
•
The prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors among
adults ≥ 18 years has been on an increasing trend.
Recommendation:
•
In the prevention of CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global
risks and all CV risk factors should be targeted.

2. Measurement of Lipids and Apolipoproteins
A standard lipid profile includes measurement of:
•
plasma or serum total cholesterol (TC)
•
LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C)
•
HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C)
•
triglycerides (TG)
TC, HDL-C and TG are measured directly.
2.1
LDL-C
LDL-C is usually calculated by the Freidewald equation. This equation is not valid in
the presence of elevated TG (TG > 4.5 mmol/L). In this situation, LDL-C will have to
be measured directly. The method of measurement is not standardized and thus, this
is not routinely performed.
Friedewald equation:
LDL-C (mmol/L) = TC – HDL-C - TG/ 2.2
(If TG > 4.5 mmol/L, this formula is not valid.)
2.2
Non- HDL-C:
Measurement of Non-HDL-C:
•
Estimates the total amount of atherogenic lipoproteins (VLDL, VLDL remnants,
IDL, LDL-C and lipoprotein(a) {Lp(a)}) present in plasma
•
Can be used to evaluate CV risk when TG is > 4.5 mmol/L12
•
Can be used to predict CV risk13-16
Non-HDL-C (mmol/L) = TC – HDL-C
(It is a target of therapy in patients with TG > 4.5 mmol/L)
If non-HDL-C is used as a treatment target, the value is 0.8 mmol/L higher than the
corresponding LDL-C target level.
2.3
Fasting vs Non-Fasting Lipid Measurement
Non-fasting lipid testing is acceptable.15,17–22 The difference in the values between a
fasting and non-fasting sample is small and has been shown to have no impact on
CV risk estimation even in diabetics.18,21,22
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
The maximal mean changes between fasting and non-fasting samples at 1–6 h after
habitual meals are +0.3 mmol/L for TG; −0.2 mmol/L for TC; −0.2 mmol/L for LDL-C;
+0.2 mmol/L for calculated remnant cholesterol; −0.2 mmol/L calculated non-HDL-C.
Concentrations of HDL-C, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and Lp(a)
are not affected by fasting/non-fasting status.21
The use of a non-fasting sample for lipid analysis simplifies blood sampling,
improves compliance to testing, helps workflow in laboratories and facilitates clinical
decision making.20,21 Numerous population studies and major trials have used
random non-fasting blood sampling for measurement of plasma or serum lipids.21
Fasting lipid profile should be considered or preferred:
•
if the non-fasting TG is > 4.5 mmol/L
•
in cases of familial hyperlipidaemia/hypertriglyceridemia
•
following recovery from hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis
•
when initiating medication(s) that may cause hypertriglyceridemia (e.g.
steroids, anti-retroviral therapy)
•
when other tests that are requested require fasting or morning samples (e.g.
fasting glucose)
Other lipid measures that can be considered include Lp(a)23 and Apo B16.
Apo B is found in each of the atherogenic lipoprotein particles -chylomicrons, very
low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), intermediate density lipoprotein
cholesterol (IDL-C), LDL-C and Lp(a). It is thus a better measure of the total
atherogenic burden of an individual.24,25 It has however not been used as a treatment
target in any intervention trial. Apo B can be used as an alternative to
non-HDL-C measurement. It is however, not routinely measured.
Key Messages
•
A standard lipid profile includes measurement of plasma or serum total
cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and
triglycerides (TG).
•
LDL-C is usually calculated by the Freidewald equation which is not valid in
the presence of elevated TG (TG > 4.5 mmol/L).
•
The difference in the values between a fasting and non-fasting sample is
small and has been shown to have no impact on CV risk estimation.
Recommendation:
•
Both fasting and non-fasting samples may be used for lipid measurement.

3. Classification of Dyslipidaemia
Dyslipidaemias may be primary (due to genetic causes) or secondary. (Table 9 & 10,
pg. 28 & 29).
In the following situations, secondary causes of dyslipidaemia should be considered:
•
When TC exceeds 7.0 mmol/L, exclude conditions such as primary
hypothyroidism, nephrosis, and cholestatic liver disease. Hypothyroidism is
more prevalent in the elderly in whom a high index of suspicion may be
necessary for diagnosis.26,27
•
Cushing’s syndrome (including subclinical disease) can lead to lipid
abnormalities in 40-70% of patients.28 Patients on exogenous steroids may
also develop secondary dyslipidaemias.
•
When TG exceeds 4.5 mmol/L, exclude secondary causes such as alcoholism.
•
When there is high TG with low HDL-C, insulin resistance states such as type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome have to be considered.
•
Failure to respond to anti-lipid therapy.
•
In patients with a family history of T2DM or a previous history of thyroid
disease.
•
The effect of drugs on lipid levels is generally small and insignificant except for
anabolic steroids that can lead to almost a 50% reduction in levels of HDL-C
and Lp (a).29–31
Treatment of the underlying aetiology can lead to an improvement in the lipid profile.

4. Dyslipidaemia as a Risk Factor for CVD
Dyslipidaemia is a major risk factor for CVD. According to the NHMS V, 47.7% of
adult Malaysians over the age of 18 have hypercholesterolemia (TC > 5.2 mmol/L)8.
In the most recent National Cardiovascular Disease Database-Percutaneous
Coronary Intervention (NCVD-PCI) Registry 2010-2012, 72.6% of patients had a
known history of hypercholesterolemia (TC > 5.2 mmol/L) at the time of
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)32.
Specific lipid abnormalities implicated are:
4.1
Elevated LDL-C levels
LDL-C has been shown to be atherogenic in epidemiological studies.33–43 There is a
direct relationship between levels of LDL-C (or TC) and the rate of new onset CHD
in men and women who were initially free from CHD.44–47 In people with established
CHD, elevated LDL-C correlates with recurrent cardiac events.48,49
Mendelian disorders resulting from mutations in the genes involved in cholesterol
metabolism, highlight the strong and causal relationship between LDL-C and CVD.50
In familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a mutation in the LDL-C receptor results in
very high levels of LDL-C and premature CVD.
It has been postulated that LDL-C levels of 1.3 to 1.8 mmol/L are physiologically
normal in man.51 There is a near absence of clinical CHD in populations with very low
levels of serum cholesterol throughout their life (TC < 3.9 mmol/L or LDL-C < 2.6
mmol/L).52,53 The risk of CHD appears to increase progressively above these levels.
In the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) Study the lowest incidence of
CHD was seen in individuals at the lowest quartile of LDL-C suggesting that optimal
values for both gender is < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/100 ml).54
A recent analysis of selected observational studies suggests that there is an inverse
relationship between levels of LDL-C and all-cause mortality in the elderly (> 60
years)55. Many of the studies that were included in this analysis however, were small
and with a wide variation in the adjustment of confounding factors. This raises
concern over the conclusion of this analysis.
Edition of
Clinical Practice Guidelines
5
th
Furthermore, epidemiological evidence indicates an association between TC (and
LDL-C) with atherosclerosis and CVD and not necessarily with all-cause mortality.56
An earlier larger systemic review of 900,000 adults showed a clear relationship
between levels of TC and vascular mortality in all age groups.57
Randomized controlled trials have repeatedly shown that lowering of LDL-C reduces
CVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in both gender.58–66 Patients
with established disease have greater absolute benefit from LDL-C reduction. There
appears to be a dose-dependent reduction in CVD with LDL-C lowering; the greater
the LDL-C reduction, the greater the CV risk reduction.58–66
Studies have also shown that LDL-C particle concentration and size are important
predictors of CVD.67-69 However measurement of these are not widely available and
are not standardized.
For these reasons, LDL-C should be the primary target for cholesterol therapy. A 1
mmol/L reduction in LDL-C reduces CV mortality by 22%.70 A meta regression
analysis showed that the use of statin and non-statin therapies that act via
upregulation of LDL receptor expression (i.e. diet, bile acid sequestrants, ileal
bypass, and ezetimibe) lead to similar reduction in major CV events per 1 mmol/L
reduction in LDL-C.71
Statins have consistently been shown to reduce CV events, are safe, well-tolerated
and cost effective.
4.2
Low HDL-C levels
There is substantial epidemiological evidence linking low HDL-C levels (< 1.0
mmol/L) with increased risk of CHD.15,72 A 1% decrease in HDL-C, in epidemiological
studies, has been associated with 2-3% increase in CHD risk.15
Clinical trials using pharmacotherapy to increase HDL-C levels have, however, not
shown any CV benefit.73-76
4.3
Elevated TG levels
The role of TG as a CV risk factor is controversial and not as robust as is with
LDL-C.14,77–80 It is now widely believed that TG is not directly atherogenic but remains
a biomarker of CV risk via its association with remnant lipoproteins and
ApoCIII.14
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
Two studies have suggested that non-fasting TG measurements are more predictive
of CV risk than fasting TG.17,81 Non-fasting TG more accurately reflects the presence
of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins compared to fasting TG measurements. There
is however a lack of a standardized protocol for quantitation of post-prandial
hypertriglyceridemia. This limits its clinical applicability.
Recent clinical trials with pharmacotherapy (fibrates and niacin) that were
specifically directed at reducing TG levels have not however, shown any benefit in
reducing CV events.76,82–85
4.4
Elevated Non-HDL-C levels
Non-HDL-C reflects the concentration of cholesterol within all lipoprotein particles
considered atherogenic. Studies have demonstrated that non-HDL-C is a better
predictor of CV risk than is LDL-C and may be especially true in statin-treated
patients.16,86–92 A prospective study demonstrated that non-HDL-C levels conferred a
similar risk of future major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as LDL-C in patients with
clinically manifest cerebrovascular, coronary artery or polyvascular diseases.89
Achieved non-HDL-C levels seem more closely associated with coronary atheroma
progression than LDL-C.93 Among statin-treated patients, on-treatment levels of
LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apo B were each associated with risk of future major CV
events, but the strength of this association was greater for non–HDL-C than for
LDL-C and apoB.16
Non-HDL-C has however, not been used as a target of therapy in either primary or
secondary prevention clinical trials.
4.5
Atherogenic Dyslipidaemia
This consists of low HDL-C, raised TG and small dense LDL particles.94,95 The LDL-C
levels are usually normal but there is a higher proportion of small dense LDL
particles which are more atherogenic.
Although epidemiological data indicates that the ratio of TC/HDL-C is a CV risk
marker, there have been no outcome studies to support using this as a target of
therapy. Its’ use is thus not recommended.
Edition of
Clinical Practice Guidelines
5
th
4.6
Lipoprotein Lp(a)
The association of Lp(a) to CV risk is continuous and independent of LDL-C or non
HDL-C levels.23,96 However, there is no data as yet that reducing Lp(a) leads to an
improvement in CV outcomes.
For this reason, Lp(a) is not recommended to be routinely measured.
Key messages
•
There is strong and consistent evidence of LDL-C as a CV risk factor.
•
LDL-C lowering has been to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in
individuals with CVD (secondary prevention) and without CVD (primary
prevention).
•
Patients with established disease have greater absolute benefit from
LDL-C reduction.
•
There appears to be a dose-dependent reduction in CVD with LDL-C
lowering; the greater the LDL-C reduction, the greater the CV risk
reduction.
•
Statins have consistently been shown to reduce CV events, safe,
well-tolerated and cost effective.
Recommendation:
•
LDL-C should be the primary target of therapy.
•
The greater the LDL-C reduction, the greater the CV risk reduction

5. Global Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
5.1
Risk Stratification
Based on the Malaysian NHMS V data, about 1 in 5 young adults (aged 18-19
years) have TC > 5.2 mmol/L.8 All the CV risk factors- diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, overweight/obesity and smoking- stratified by age,
showed a sharp increase in prevalence from the age group 25-29 years.8
As such, the committee advocates screening all adults > 30 years of age.
These individuals should have a complete lipid profile (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and
TG). The presence of other CV risk factors (blood sugar, blood pressure (BP),
weight, smoking status, physical inactivity) should also be determined and the
individual counselled appropriately.
Individuals who are at high risk of developing CVD should have a lipid profile
earlier in life (> 18 years of age). This includes individuals with a family history
of premature CVD, genetic dyslipidaemias, metabolic syndrome, diabetes
mellitus (DM) and abdominal obesity.
5.2
Prevention of CVD
Individuals at highest risk of CVD can be categorized as (Table 4, pg 20):
•
Very High Risk, or
•
High Risk
Very High Risk individuals include those with (Table 4, pg. 20):
•
Established CVD
 Patients who already had a CV event are at highest risk for a recurrent
event.
▪ After an ACS, the 6-month risk of CV death and major CV event rate

it just a CV risk marker.101,105,106

Individuals who belong to the above Very High Risk and High Risk categories,
should be encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle (stop smoking, regular
exercise and a healthy diet) in addition to pharmacotherapy, to ensure that all
their risk factors are treated to targets.
These individuals derive the greatest benefit from risk factor reduction and lipid
lowering statin therapy.108,109
In all otherwise healthy individuals, their global CV risk should first be
determined to help guide the intensity of risk factor reduction efforts. Based on
their CV risk, they may be categorized as:
•
Intermediate (Moderate) Risk
•
Low Risk
I, A
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
CV risk refers to the likelihood of an individual developing a CV event, fatal or
non-fatal, over a defined time period.
The relative risk reduction of lipid lowering therapy is similar in all individuals
irrespective of their CV risk status. However, in low risk individuals the absolute
benefit may be less.108-111
There are several risk equations that may be used to determine CV risk. (Appendix 1,
pg. 102). The cut-off points that are used in these risk models to define risk categories
are in part arbitrary. They are based on the risk levels at which benefit
was demonstrated in clinical trials.
All risk models have limitations and difficulty when extrapolated to our local
population. Ideally, the CV risk model used should be based on data derived from our
local population. Currently, we do not have such a CV risk score. Both Thailand and
Singapore have their own CV risk score which is based on the older Framingham
Risk Score (10-year risk of CHD deaths, Non-fatal MI only) adapted
to the local populations.112,113
The risk score that is widely used in Malaysia is the Framingham General CVD risk
score tool (FRS-General CVD) for primary care that assesses the 10-year risk of
developing CVD (heart disease, strokes, PAD and heart failure).3 (Tables 1 & 2 pg.
17-18) It can also be calculated online at https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/
risk-functions/cardiovascular-disease/10-year-risk.php
The earlier version of the Framingham Risk Score CHD (2002) provided a risk
estimate of “hard” CHD events only i.e. cardiac death and non-fatal MI.
The FRS – General CVD has the advantage of being derived from a population that
had received no or little treatment at the start and during the study.114 It is also simple
and easy to use – an important feature if healthcare providers are to use it routinely.115
In two local studies, the FRS-General CVD risk model was a better
discriminator of CV risk in our local multi ethnic population.116,117
The new 2013 ACC / AHA risk calculator has the advantage that it is gender
specific.118 In a local study, however, this risk model overestimated CV risk in the
Malaysian population.119
Individuals who belong to the Very High Risk and High Risk categories
mentioned earlier in section 5.1 do not need to be risk stratified.

All other apparently healthy individuals should be risk stratified using the
FRS-General CVD Risk Score3 (Tables 1 & 2 pg. 17-18) or online at
https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk-functions/cardiovascular-disease/10-ye
ar-risk.php
The 10-year risk calculation is to be performed at the outset to help guide the
intensity of lipid lowering therapy.
•
It cannot be used to track changes in risk over time as risk factors are
modified.
•
In calculating the risk scores the TC and HDL-C should be the average of at
least 2 measurements.
•
The average baseline blood pressure (BP) should be obtained from an
average of several readings.
•
A “smoker” means any cigarette smoking in the past month.
Based on the 10-year CV risk, individuals may be:
•
> 20% - High CV Risk
•
10-20 % - Intermediate (Moderate) CV Risk
•
< 10% - Low CV Risk
Those individuals with a 10-year risk of CVD of > 20% are High Risk. (Section 5.1,
pg
34) They
should
be
treated
aggressively
from
the
outset
with
non-pharmacological measures and pharmacotherapy to achieve treatment targets.
Individuals who have a 10-year CVD risk of < 10% are Low Risk. Low-risk
individuals should be given advice to help them maintain this status.
Many young individuals may fall into this category of low absolute risk of CVD but
they may have a high lifetime risk if their individual risk factors are high. These
include individuals with:
•
BP > 180/110 mmHg
•
LDL-C > 4.9 mmol/L
In these individuals, using Vascular Age (Table 3A & B, pg. 19)3 may be helpful in
defining CV Risk and guiding management strategies. This risk model has not been
validated in our local population.
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
Individuals who have a 10-year CVD risk of 10-20% are Intermediate
(Moderate) Risk. In these individuals, other risk factors not included in the
FRS-General CVD Risk Score may influence treatment targets and the
decision to initiate pharmacotherapy.
Additional factors that may support upgrading of CV risk include120:
•
family history of premature CVD - males (father and/or brother(s)) < 55
years of age and females (mothers and/or sister(s)) < 65 years of age121–125
•
ankle: brachial (ABI) index < 0.9 - this indicates PAD, the lower the index,
the more severe the disease
•
hs-CRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L120
•
coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 300 Agatston units.120,126–129 This is an
indirect measure of disease burden.
Routine measurement of carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) for risk
assessment is no longer recommended.130
These risk models help guide risk assessment and management. They do not
replace sound clinical judgement in the assessment of global risk and
management strategies. It has not as yet been demonstrated that with
upgrading of the risk category of patients at Intermediate (Moderate) Risk
and subjecting them to aggressive risk factor reduction, it would lead to
reduction in CV risk and improvement in CV outcomes.131
The intensity of preventive actions should be tailored to the patient’s total CV
risk. The risks (side effects, costs etc.) should be weighed against the benefits
of each intervention. In subjects who are at Low or Intermediate (Moderate)
risk, the decision to initiate pharmacotherapy should be individualised
following a mutual discussion with the patient.
Key messages:
•
The intensity of LDL-C lowering should be tailored to the individual’s
global CV risk.
Recommendations:
• All individuals should be risk stratified. (Table 4, pg. 20)
• Patients with established CVD, CKD and diabetes fall into the Very
High and High Risk Categories.
• All other individuals should be risk stratified at the outset using the
Framingham General CVD risk score to determine if they are at High,
Intermediate (Moderate) or Low Risk. (Tables 1 & 2, pg. 17-18)
• The intensity of risk factor reduction and target lipid levels will depend
on their CV risk. (Table 4, pg. 20)

Non-HDL-C Goals
Non-HDL-C may be considered as a secondary target when treating patients
with:
•
combined hyperlipidaemias
•
diabetes138
•
cardio metabolic risk
•
chronic kidney disease
The targets for non-HDL-C are < 2.6 mmol/L and < 3.4 mmol/L in subjects at
high and very high CV risk respectively. The specific goal for non-HDL-C
should be 0.8 mmol/L higher than the corresponding LDL-C goal.
Adjusting lipid lowering therapy to achieve these secondary goals may be
considered after achieving LDL-C targets in patients with Very High and High
CV risk. Although increases in HDL-C predict atherosclerosis regression and
low HDL-C is associated with excess events in CHD patients, clinical trial
evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of intervention.73-76
Recommendations:
• Non-HDL-C may be considered as a secondary target when treating
patients with combined hyperlipidaemias, diabetes, cardio metabolic
risk and chronic kidney disease.

Lifestyle
Changes
as
the
Foundation
for
CVD
Risk-Reduction
Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) i.e. adhering to a healthy diet, regular exercise,
avoidance of tobacco smoking, alcohol restriction and maintenance of an ideal
weight, remains a critical component of health promotion and CVD risk reduction
efforts both prior to and after commencement of lipid lowering therapies in all
individuals.
These measures should be promoted as a population based strategy for prevention
of CVD.139 A diet high in fibre, fruits and vegetable, wholegrain, low in salt and
saturated/trans-fat is associated with lower CV risk and should be encouraged in all
individuals.139
7.1.1
Dietary Modification
This CPG focuses on dietary therapy for dyslipidaemia. There is limited randomized
controlled trial (RCT) on dietary interventions and CV risk reduction, most of the data
being derived from observational studies. For a more detailed discussion of nutrition
for health and weight loss, refer to the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines
Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, 1st Ed. 2017.139
TLC is an essential component of the treatment of dyslipidaemia from the initial
diagnosis. It is especially important in obese individuals, smokers and those who
lead a sedentary lifestyle. It should be emphasized in both primary and secondary
prevention. (Table 6, pg. 21)
Dietary therapy is aimed at optimising lipid levels while maintaining a balanced diet.
It is advised to refer to a dietician for medical nutrition therapy (MNT). Dietary
therapy is continued to empower the individual to manage their stages of change to
achieve their nutritional goal. To optimize outcomes, motivational interviews are
beneficial.140
7.1.1.1
Dietary Cholesterol
The role of serum cholesterol (especially LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and CVD is consistent and robust. (Section 4, pg. 30). The
contribution of dietary cholesterols to blood cholesterol levels is however, more
complex and controversial. The question is whether eating food high in cholesterol
leads to high serum cholesterol and LDL-C, and whether limiting dietary cholesterol
intake lowers serum LDL-C.141
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
Recent data indicate that the impact of dietary cholesterol on serum
cholesterol levels is weak.131,142 However, many high-cholesterol foods also
contain high levels of saturated fats (SFA). This includes dairy products, meat
and most processed foods. For this reason, international lipid guidelines
recommend limiting dietary cholesterol to < 200 mg/day in secondary
prevention.131,143
7.1.1.2
Total Fats, Saturated Fats and Unsaturated Fats
The recommended total fat intake is between 20 to 25% with an upper limit
of 30% of total energy intake in all individuals.144,145 (Table 6, pg. 21)
Fats in the diet consist of TG which is made up of three fatty acids and a
glycerol backbone.146 Fatty acids differ in the length of their aliphatic tails,
ranging from short chain (≤ 5) to very long chain (≥ 22) fatty acids. Depending
on the number of double bonds, fatty acids can be further categorized as:
•
Saturated fatty acids (SFA) - no double bonds
•
Unsaturated fats which may occur as either:
 polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) - 2 or more double bonds
 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) - 1 double bond
Oils are mixtures of fatty acids. (Appendix 2, pg 100 for faty acid composition
of common dietary oils)
The predominant fatty acids present in the following oils are:144,147
•
coconut oil, palm kernel oil, santan, palm oil, beef, pork, milk, yogurt,
cheese - SFA
•
corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, tofu, tempeh, walnut - PUFA
•
olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil (n=20), almond, peanut, hazelnut, palm oil
- MUFA
Omega fatty acids are PUFA and include:
•
omega-6 fatty acids - linoleic acid found in vegetable oils such as
sunflower, safflower, soybean, corn, grapeseed, peanut and canola oils
as well as nuts and seeds148
•
omega-3 fatty acids which consists of:
 α-linolenic acid (ALA)- found in plant oils, canola oil, flaxseed oil,
soybean , chia seed, linseed and rapeseed oils, walnuts, and leafy
green vegetables144,149,150
 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) - found in marine oils151
 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - found in marine oils151,152
The body can produce all the required fatty acids except for the essential fatty
acids -linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.153 These have to come from the
I, B
Edition of
Clinical Practice Guidelines
5
th
diet e.g. corn, sunflower and soybean, flaxseed walnuts and dark leafy
vegetables (e.g. spinach, kailan).
The rate of conversion of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids in the
body is low.149 Thus it is also important to increase the intake of omega-3 fatty
acids in the diet. Sources of omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) are fatty fish (e.g. salmon, ikan
kembung, ikan jelawat, siakap, keli, patin, senangin, white pomfret).144,151,152
Excess intake of SFA has been implicated with an increased risk of CVD in
several epidemiological studies.142 A recent large meta-analysis however,
found no association between SFA intake and all-cause mortality, CVD, CHD,
ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes.154 The authors however concluded that
the evidence was heterogeneous with methodological limitations. They state
that the review does not support recommendations to increase SFA intakes.154
The current recommendation is that the intake of SFA should not exceed 10%
of energy intake.131,142,144 (Table 6, pg. 21)
As the intake of SFA is reduced to even lower than 10% of total energy intake,
there continues to be a favourable effect on lipoprotein profile.146 There is little
evidence however at present, that a reduction in SFA intake below 9% of total
energy intake is associated with a reduced CVD risk.155 With reduction in SFA
intake, dietary cholesterol intake is also lowered since SFA and cholesterol
often coexist in the same food.
A central issue in the relationship between SFA and CVD is the specific
macronutrients that are used to replace it in the diet.142 When SFA is replaced
with:
•
PUFA, there is consistent data that CV events and coronary mortality
are reduced.142
•
MUFA or CHO, the evidence is not that clear that it lowers CVD risk.140,142
•
Excess CHO, it may, in fact, contribute to an atherogenic dyslipidaemia
with small dense LDL, low HDL-C levels, insulin resistance and
obesity.140,142
Taking PUFA or MUFA (e.g. 1 teaspoon of olive oil/ virgin coconut oil) without
cutting down SFA intake will not confer CV benefit.

Trans Fats
Trans fat (TFA) may be:156
•
"Industrially produced" TFA- these are man-made fats added to foods
such as shortening and baked goods
•
"Ruminant" TFA- these occur naturally in small amounts in foods such as
butter and beef
Trans fats are created through a process of partial hydrogenation.156 The
presence of TFA make oils more solid and extend their shelf life.156 Major
sources of TFA are deep fried fast foods, margarines, commercially baked
cookies, cakes, crackers, and some breads.156 Repeated/ prolonged heating
of MUFA and PUFA may convert them to trans fat.
Intake of TFA raises levels of LDL-C, reduces HDL-C and increases the ratio of
TC to HDL-C.156 Prospective cohort studies showed that TFA was also
associated with an increase in the incidence of diabetes.157–159
TFA appears to increase the risk of CVD more than any other macronutrient on
a per calorie basis.156 Even at low levels of consumption of 1-3% of total energy
intake, CV risk is substantially increased.156 Total TFA fat intake was
associated with all-cause mortality, CHD mortality and total CHD. Industrial,
but not ruminant, TFA fats were associated with CHD mortality and CHD.146,160
A 2 percent increase in energy intake from trans fats was associated with a 23
percent increase in the incidence of CHD.161 It was estimated that substituting
2% of energy from trans fats with saturated fat, MUFA and PUFA would reduce
CV risk by 17%, 21% and 24% respectively.161
A more recent meta-analysis however, showed that only replacement of TFA
fat with PUFA, MUFA or CHO resulted in more favourable lipoprotein
profiles.162 The effect was most consistent with PUFA. Replacement with SFA
tended to lead to higher TC and LDL-C levels.162
There has been no consistent scientific evidence of a relationship between TFA
with BP or cancer.163
TFA intake should be kept at less than 1% of total energy.131,142 (Table 6, pg. 21
and Appendix 3, pg. 104)

7.1.1.4
Atherogenic Dyslipidaemia
Atherogenic dyslipidaemia comprises a triad of low HDL-C, high TG and
increased levels of small dense LDL-C. In prospective cohort studies, the
presence of a low HDL-C and a raised TG have been associated with
increased CV events. The use of pharmacotherapy to lower TG and increase
HDL-C however, have been, to date, either neutral or shown an increase in
adverse outcomes.73–76,82–85
Dietary modification can result in an improvement in atherogenic
dyslipidaemia. A low carbohydrate (CHO) diet (< 26% of total enegy intake)
results in a significant reduction in TG levels, an increase in HDL-C levels and
a shift from small dense LDL-C to the larger buoyant LDL-C even in the
presence of a high SFA diet and in the absence of weight loss.164–169 The Low
Fat diet, on the other hand, required weight loss for an improvement in the
atherogenicprofile.167
The effects of a low CHO diet on long term health are unknown.142, 170,171
7.1.2
Exercise
Regular exercise reduces the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in both
healthy individuals and patients with CVD by 20–30%.172–174
Studies show that regular aerobic exercise can:175,176
•
increase HDL-C by 3–10% (up to 0.16 mmol/L)
•
reduce TG by about 11% (up to 0.34 mmol/L)
Vigorous aerobic exercise improves HDL-C more than less-intense exercise.175
The decrease in TG with exercise is acute and short-lived, becomes evident
12-18 hours after a single bout of exercise and lasts for 2-3 days.177 It requires
that a certain amount of energy (a threshold) be expended during exercise,
independent of duration or intensity. More exercise above that threshold does
not seem to result in greater reductions in plasma TG concentrations.177
The recommended duration of exercise for CVD prevention in healthy adults
regardless of age is:173,174
•
at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity or
•
75 minutes a week of vigorous intensity PA or an equivalent combination
For weight loss, increased physical activity of approximately 250 to 450
minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, including strength
training 2 to 3 times per week is required.178 This should be accompanied with
a calorie restricted diet.

Smoking
Smoking is a strong and independent risk factor for CVD.179,180 It accelerates
coronary plaque development and may lead to plaque rupture.180
Smoking has:181
•
An adverse effect on TG - heavy smokers had a significantly higher
concentration.
•
The concentration of HDL-C was inversely related to smoking,
non-smokers having the highest concentration.
The concentrations of TC, fasting blood glucose and uric acid were correlated
with body mass index (BMI) rather than smoking.181
Cigarette smoking cessation increases serum levels of HDL-C, especially in
women, but has no effect on TC, LDL-C, and TG.182,183 This improvement in
HDL-C levels may be offset by the weight increase that occurs after
quitting.184,185 Strategies should be taken to minimise the weight gain following
smoking cessation.
There is significant reduction in CV morbidity within the first 6 months of
smoking cessation.179 The risks of CVD decreases gradually after smoking
cessation and reaches that of non-smokers after 10-15 years.179 This benefit
occurs independent of its effect on lipids.
Smoking should be discouraged179 and individuals referred to the MQuit
Services. More information is available at www.JomQuit.com.my
Key message:
•
Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain a critical component of
CVD risk reduction efforts both prior to and after commencement of
lipid lowering therapies in all individuals.
I, B
Recommendations:
•
The recommended total fat intake for healthy adults is between 20
to 25% with an upper limit of 30% of total energy intake.

•
TFA intake should be kept at less than 1% of total energy.

7.2 Lipid Modifying Drugs
TLC form an integral component in the management of dyslipidaemia. In
secondary dyslipidaemia, efforts should be made to correct the underlying
cause.
Most individuals at Low Risk and Intermediate (Moderate) Risk can be
managed by TLC alone. Occasionally, lipid modifying agents may be
necessary to achieve target lipid levels. Only statins have been studied in
primary prevention.
In those at Very High and High CV Risk, it is recommended that drug
treatment be initiated simultaneously with TLC. There are five major groups
of lipid modifying drugs. (Table 11, pg. 49)
Not all lipid modifying drugs/ interventions mentioned in this CPG are
available in the MOH hospitals/Malaysia.

Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
7.2.1
HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)
Statins are inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in
hepatic cholesterol synthesis.
LDL-C reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid lowering
therapy to reduce risk of CVD.108–111 They are the drugs of choice in reducing
LDL-C because of the consistent results of numerous randomized primary and
secondary prevention clinical trials.108–111
The amount of CV risk reduction seen will depend on the absolute risk of the
individual and the degree of LDL-C lowering that is achieved (level of LDL-C
achieved and/or the percentage reduction).70,108,109,132–137 Depending on the on
treatment level of LDL-C level achieved, lipid modifying agents can slow the
progression or even promote regression of coronary atherosclerotic
plaques.132–134,186,187 An achieved treatment LDL-C level of <1.8 mmol/L
appears to significantly slow down progression of atherosclerosis. 132–134,186,187
Statins have moderate effect in lowering TG and in elevating HDL-C. (Table
11, pg. 49)
Treatment is initiated at the recommended starting dose with the evening meal
or at bed time especially with simvastatin.188 Small short term clinical studies
indicated that the LDL-C fell significantly by 5-8% when simvastatin was taken
in the evening rather than in the morning.189–193
Since cholesterol is biosynthesized in the early morning hours, statins with
shorter half-lives (lovastatin 2 hours, simvastatin <5 hours, and fluvastatin <3
hours) should be administered in the evening. In contrast, statins with longer
half-lives (atorvastatin 14 hours, rosuvastatin 19 hours, and pravastatin 22
hours) can be administered during the day.188,194
Statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. It should not be
prescribed to women of child bearing potential unless adequate contraception
is taken. If pregnancy is planned, then statins should be discontinued.

Monitoring Statin Therapy
It should be stressed that these individuals will be on lifelong therapy. It is therefore
important to assess them on a regular basis to monitor for:
•
Response to therapy and achievement of lipid targets.
 The degree of LDL-C reduction is dose dependent and varies between
the different statins.197
 There is considerable inter-individual variation in LDL-C reduction
with the same dose of drug.198
 Inadequate response to statin treatment may be due to poor
compliance and/or genetic variations of cholesterol and statin metabolism
in the liver.199,200
•
Adverse effects
A) Response to Therapy
Lipid profile should be measured at 1 to 3 months following initiation and following a
change in the dose of statin therapy. The dose is then adjusted accordingly to
achieve LDL-C levels.
If LDL-C targets have been achieved, the same dose of statin should be maintained.
The drug should not be stopped. The lipid profile can be repeated at 6 to 12 month
intervals.
If LDL-C target is not achieved, the dose of statin can be uptitrated to the maximal
tolerated dose. If target level still not achieved, then a non-statin drug can be added.
(Table 7, pg. 22)
The frequency of repeat testing while on stable lipid therapy, will depend on the
individual adherence to therapy and lipid profile consistency; if adherence is a
concern or the lipid profile is unstable, then more frequent assessment may be
necessary.195
B) Safety/Adverse Effects
B.1. Liver Function
•
Hepatic transaminases should be measured at baseline and at 1 to 3 months
after starting treatment and/or following a change in dose.
•
If levels are elevated prior to therapy, other causes (e.g. fatty liver, hepatitis)
should be excluded. If due to fatty liver, lipid lowering therapy is not
contraindicated.
•
Mild elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT) occurs in < 3% of patients on statin
treatment, more commonly with potent statins or high doses.201
Edition of
Clinical Practice Guidelines
5
th
•
Mild elevation of ALT has not been shown to be associated with true
hepatotoxicity or changes in liver function.
•
When transaminase levels (especially ALT) are > 3 times the upper limit of
normal (ULN) on 2 occasions, the drug should be stopped. Reversal of
transaminase elevation is frequently noted with reduction of the dose or
cessation of the drug.
•
Cautious reintroduction of therapy may be considered under close monitoring
after ALT values have returned to normal.
•
Progression to liver failure is exceedingly rare. Routine monitoring of ALT
during long term statin treatment is no longer recommended.202
B.2. Muscle Symptoms
•
In clinical practice and registries, 10-30% of patients report statin-associated
muscle symptoms (SAMS).203,204 This includes myalgia (normal creatine
kinase (CK)), myositis (CK > ULN) and rhabdomyolysis (CK > 10X of ULN).
 The incidence of SAMS is much lower in clinical trials, and only differs
slightly from placebo.205-207 In observational studies, the frequency
varies between 10 and 15%208-209. In a study by Parker designed
specifically to study the effects of statins on muscle symptoms, the
frequency of muscle-related complaints was approximately 9%.210
 Myalgia (without CK elevation) occurs in 5-10% of patients in clinical
practice.210 If the symptoms are not tolerable or are progressive, the dose
of statin should be reduced or the drug stopped.
 The incidence of myopathy (myositis and rhabdomyolysis) is low and is
more likely to occur in persons with complex medical problems (in particular
CKD) and/or who are taking multiple medications, or in elderly persons,
especially women.
•
Creatine Kinase (CK) is not routinely measured unless myositis is suspected. If
the level is more than five times the ULN on two occasions, the drug should be
discontinued.
•
There is no uniform definition for statin intolerance. In certain trials; ‘statin
intolerant’ patients are defined as patients unable to tolerate at least two different
statins because of unexplained skeletal muscle-related symptoms (pain, aches,
weakness, or cramping) that began or increased during statin therapy and
returned to baseline when statin therapy was discontinued.205
•
When a statin myopathy is suspected, typically the first step is statin
discontinuation for 2-3 weeks.
 If symptoms have not resolved, it is unlikely to be statin related and the
patient should be continued on the same dose of statin
 If symptoms have resolved, then the following strategies may be
considered:
▪ Lowering the dose or decreasing the frequency to less than daily.211
▪ An alternative dosing such as every other day or twice a week with
atorvastatin or rosuvastatin212 can be used
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
▪
Treatment with the highest tolerable dose of statin in combination
with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe),
▪
If indicated, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered.213,214
92% of statin intolerant patients do well with a second statin.211
73% will tolerate a re-challenge with a third statin.211
•
An alternative approach is to consider co-enzyme Q10 to alleviate the
symptoms of myalgia. The relationship between co-enzyme Q10 and
statin related muscle symptoms is circumstantial. However, the risk of
side effects from co-enzyme Q10 is low. Thus a trial of co-enzyme Q10
in patients with possible statin related muscle side effects may be
considered. The response rate is variable.215–217
•
The routine use of co-enzyme Q10 together with statins is unproven and
therefore not recommended.215–217
Care should be taken when prescribing high doses of simvastatin
(>20 mg/daily) together with certain other medications that inhibit the
cytochrome P450 pathway. It has the potential of increasing the risk of muscle
injury.218,219
B.3. Diabetes
•
Statins have been associated with a slight increase in new-onset
diabetes (9-12%)220,221. It occurs with all statins and may be dose
related.
•
The CV reduction benefits seen with statins far outweigh the risk of
developing diabetes. In fact statins have been proven to prevent CV
events in persons with diabetes with no overt CVD.59,109,222
•
Screening for diabetes should be considered at 6 - 12 monthly intervals
in patients at high risk of developing diabetes. These include the
following individuals/conditions:
 Elderly
 Metabolic syndrome
 Obesity or signs of insulin resistance
 Family history of DM (parents and siblings)

th
B.4. Kidney Effects
•
An increased frequency of proteinuria has been reported for all statins,
more so for rosuvastatin.
•
The proteinuria induced by statins is of tubular origin and is due to
reduced tubular reabsorption and not to glomerular dysfunction.223
•
In clinical trials the frequency of proteinuria is in general, low and in
most cases is not higher than for placebo.224
•
As such, we do not recommend routine monitoring of renal function or
proteinuria.224
B.5. Neurocognitive function
•
Regulatory bodies have required that a statement be added to the drug
label for all statins indicating that there is a potential for cognitive
side-effects (such as memory loss and confusion).225
•
Clinical studies designed to assess the effect of statins on cognitive
function have, however, found little to no evidence that statins are
associated with adverse effects on memory or cognition.226,227
B.6. Others
•
There is no evidence that patients on statins have increased risk of
non-CV mortality (e.g. cancers, suicides).
7.2.1.2 Optimising Statin Therapy
The therapeutic doses of statins used in clinical practice should be similar
between Asian and Caucasian populations. Studies conducted among Asian
and Caucasian subjects concluded that systemic exposure to atorvastatin did
not differ between the two groups.228,229
•
High-intensity statin therapy produces a greater percentage LDL-C
reduction and thus reduces CV events more than moderate-intensity
statin therapy.108-111(Table 12, pg. 54)
•
Lower-intensity statin therapy has also been shown to reduce CV events,
but to a lesser degree.108-111
•
Very High Risk and High Risk individuals should be treated with the
maximum appropriate intensity of a statin that does not cause adverse
effects.108,109,132–137

7.2.1.3 Adhering to Statin Therapy
•
The importance of LDL-C lowering to prevent CVD is strongly emphasized.
There appears to be a dose-dependent reduction in CVD with LDL-C
lowering; the greater the LDL-C reduction, the greater the CV risk
reduction.60,108,109,231
•
The benefits related to LDL-C reduction are not specific for statin
therapy.66,71,135 No level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm
occurs has been defined.
•
CV risk reduction should be individualised, and this can be more specific if
goals are defined. The use of goals can also aid patient-doctor
communication and facilitate adherence to treatment.
•
We therefore advocate LDL-C treatment goals and where applicable
percentage LDL-C reduction. (Table 4, pg. 20)
7.2.2
Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors
Cholesterol absorption inhibitors selectively blocks intestinal absorption of both
dietary and biliary cholesterols and other phytosterols. This leads to a reduction
in hepatic cholesterol delivery - a mechanism which complements the action of
statins.
There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe
pharmacokinetics, and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild
hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal insufficiency.
No major adverse effects have been reported; the most frequent adverse
effects are moderate elevations of liver enzymes and muscle pain.

It is used in combination with any dose of any statin to further lower LDL-C if
targets are not achieved.
When used in combination with a statin, it was found to have CV benefits in
individuals with CKD.232

combination with statins in patients with CHD.66,134
It may be considered as monotherapy in patients who cannot tolerate statins.
Recommended Dose:
•
Ezetimibe 10 mg daily
7.2.3
PCSK9 Inhibitors
This is a new class of lipid-lowering drug that target the proprotein convertase
subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). It works by inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to
the LDL-receptors. This interaction decreases the degradation of the
LDL-receptors, resulting in higher LDL-receptors density at the cell surface.
The higher expression of LDL-receptors at the cell surface leads to increased
clearance with resulting decrease in LDL-C levels.233,234
Currently, monoclonal antibodies have been developed against PCSK9 that
have been shown to reduce LDL-C levels by about 50%, irrespective of the
background lipid-lowering therapy.135,213,214,235–237 No major changes were
reported on HDL-C or plasma TG levels.
A recent study indicated that the PCSK9-inhibitor, evolocumab, when
administered in addition to high dose statins to patients with CVD who had not
achieved an LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L, reduced the risk of major CV events.238
Currently, it is only available as an injection administered subcutaneously at
2-4 weeks intervals. Common side effects are injection-site swelling, flu-like
symptoms, nausea and joint pains. Neurocognitive effects were reported in
less than 1% and this requires further rigorous assessments. A recent trial did
not show any increase in neurocognitive side effects.239
Possible indications for this group of drugs as add on therapy are:
•
individuals with high CV risk who have persistently elevated LDL-C
despite optimum lipid-modifying therapy238
•
those with familial hypercholesterolemia – heterozygous FH and to a
lesser extent those with homozygous FH235–237

Very High Risk and High Risk patients with true statin intolerance and

inhibitors.213,214
Recommended Dose:
•
Dose of evolocumab: 140 mg SC every two weeks or 420 mg SC
monthly
•
Dose of alirocumab: 75-150 mg SC every two weeks
7.2.4
Fibric Acid Derivatives (Fibrates)
Fibrates are Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) – α agonist
which have an important role in fatty acid oxidation. They reduce serum
TG effectively and increase HDL-C modestly.
Fibrates have not been shown to reduce CVD events in the secondary
prevention trials.82,85,240
Its use is limited to the treatment of patients with very high TG levels who do
not respond to non-pharmacological measures.241 (Table 13, pg. 56)
In persons with diabetes already on maximally tolerated statins, and who have
low HDL-C (≤0.88 mmol/L) and high TG (≥2.3 mmol/L), fibrates may be
considered to reduce CV events.242
Doses of fibrates need to be adjusted in the presence of CKD. Serum ALT
should be monitored when starting therapy or when doses are increased.

Bile Acid Sequestrants (Anion exchange resins)
Bile acid sequestrants bind to bile acids to promote their secretion into the
intestines. They are effective in lowering LDL-C. Resins may increase TG and
HDL-C slightly. Its use is discouraged in patients with TG ≥3.4 mmol/L.243
Monotherapy has a modest effect on CHD in primary prevention.45,46,244
Gastrointestinal adverse effects are often present with this drugs even at low
doses, which limit their practical use. Other medications should be taken 1
hour before and/or 4 hours after resins.
Recommended Dose:
Cholestyramine: 4 g/d increased by 4g at weekly intervals to 12-24 g/day in
1-4 divided doses, Max: 24 g/day
7.2.6
Nicotinic Acid (Niacin) and Its Derivatives
Nicotinic acid decreases mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissues.
It increases HDL-C and lowers TG levels. Its effect on TC reduction is modest.
An earlier trial showed mortality benefits with niacin during long term follow
up.83 More contemporary clinical studies, however, have not shown any CV
benefits.76,245
It may be considered as an alternative therapy to fibrates in individuals with
elevated TG not responsive to non-pharmacological methods.
Recommended Dosages:
•
Nicotinic acid (Niacin) is available as tablets of 50mg, capsules of 100
mg and 250 mg
•
Starting dose: 150-300 mg daily in divided doses, titration of dose up to 2
g/day (usual dose). It should be taken with meals to reduce
gastrointestinal side effects.
7.2.7
Combination therapy
There is sufficient evidence to show that the addition of non-statin therapies to
statins is both safe and effective in further lowering LDL-C and improving CV
outcomes66,134,232,238
IIa, B
IIa,C
IIa, B
IIa, B
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
Combination therapy is used when LDL-C targets are not achieved despite
optimal statin dose or maximally tolerated statin dose.
A. Achieving LDL-C Target
The combinations that may be used are:
•
Statin + cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe)66,134,232
•
Statin + bile acid exchange resins243
•
Statin + PCSK-9 inhibitors135,213,214,235–239
B. Low HDL-C, High TG After LDL-C Target is Achieved
Achieving LDL-C target is the priority.
Occasionally combination therapy may be used if LDL-C target is achieved
but HDL-C is low and TG is high.
•
There is no data that drug therapy in this subset of individuals will
reduce CV events.
•
Subgroup analysis suggest a small benefit with the addition of fibrates to
statins.242
When using a combination of statin and fibrates, the following should be
considered:
•
Fibrates increase the risk of myopathy with statins, and the risk is
highest for gemfibrozil.
•
The risk with gemfibrozil is 15 times higher when compared to
fenofibrate.246,247
•
The combination of statins and gemfibrozil is discouraged.
•
The risk of myopathy when combining statins with fenofibrate seems to
be small.248
•
Fibrates should preferably be taken in the morning and statins in the
evening to minimize peak dose concentrations and decrease the risk of
myopathy.
•
No increased risk has been seen with a statin and a nicotinic acid
combination.245

7.3 Pharmacoeconomics of Lipid Lowering Therapy
Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) are the most cost-effective options
available for primary CVD prevention.
Cost effective analysis of major lipid lowering trials have shown that although
direct short term cost may be higher, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio
(derived from the ratio of cost over quality adjusted life years) is favourable for
generic and even for patented lipid modifying agents.249
In a Malaysian study, both atorvastatin and simvastatin scored consistently
high total utility score even before drug cost were included.250
The economic implication of treating dyslipidaemia should not be judged only
by the direct out of pocket cost. Dyslipidaemia leads to major CV events which
have economic implications. The incidence of CVD and CKD in the country is
on the rise and so is the cost associated with it. As such the economic
implication of treating dyslipidaemia must be looked at from the perspective of
total cost (direct and intangible cost) instead of just direct out of pocket cost.
A substantial proportion of statin acquisition cost was offset by reduction in
health care resource use as a consequent of lesser CV events. Even taking
into consideration the cost of patented statin, statin use is cost effective even
in primary prevention of medium risk individuals.251
There are generics available for almost all lipid modifying agents. It is
important that these generic lipid modifying agents undergo bioequivalence
studies with periodic quality control.
7.3.1
LDL-C Apheresis
LDL-C apheresis is indicated in patients with homozygous FH who do not
respond satisfactorily to maximum multiple drug therapy.252–255
This form of treatment may also be considered in individuals with severe
heterozygous FH and progressive coronary artery disease (CAD) who do not
achieve target lipid levels with maximal drug therapy (high intensity statin at
maximal dose with ezetimibe/PCSK9).
IIb, C
IIa, B
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
In some patients with very high LDL-C levels, despite aggressive treatment with
medications plus LDL-C apheresis, progression of atherosclerosis may occur but at
a lesser extent.
Key messages:
•
Statins are the drug of choice for reducing LDL-C in a wide range of
individuals with dyslipidaemia.
•
Some individuals may require combination therapy to achieve LDL-C goals.
Recommendations:
•
Individuals should be on lifelong therapy.
•
They should be assessed on a regular basis for:
 Response to therapy and achievement of lipid targets.
▪ Lipid profile should be measured at 1 to 3 months following
initiation and following a change in the dose of statin therapy. The
dose is then adjusted accordingly to achieve LDL-C levels.

Adverse effects
▪ Hepatic transaminases should be measured at baseline and at 1 to
3 months after starting treatment and/or following a change in dose.
▪ CK is measured if myositis is suspected.
▪ Should there be an adverse effect, the dose of the drug should be
reduced or it should be temporarily discontinued. Following an
improvement and normalization of symptoms and/or biochemical
parameters, the drug can be reintroduced at a lower dose. If the
adverse effect recurs, then the drug should be discontinued and an
alternative form of treatment used.

8. Primary Prevention
Primary prevention is prevention of the occurrence of CVD in people without CVD.
It is directed at healthy individuals without any CV event.
Strategies of Primary Prevention
The strategy is based on a:
•
Population based strategy
This is aimed at educating the public concerning CVD, its presentation and
complications, cardiac risk factors, and the importance of maintaining a
healthy lifestyle, which is a healthy diet, weight control, increased physical
activity and the avoidance or cessation of smoking.
These measures should be started early in life. Mass screening for dyslipidaemia is
not advocated as it is not cost effective and there may be inadequate follow-up and
counselling.
•
Individual based strategy
The aim is to identify individuals at risk of developing CVD and modifying
their risk factors. Based on the NHMS V, this would include individuals
above the age of 30 years. Individuals who are at high risk of developing
CVD should have a lipid profile earlier in life (> 18 years of age).
In these individuals, the emphasis should be on TLC. (Table 6, pg 21) The majority
will be in the Low Risk and Intermediate (Moderate) Risk Categories. Refer to the
Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines on Primary and Secondary Prevention of
Cardiovascular Disease, 1st Ed, 2017.139
Key messages:
•
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle- a healthy diet, weight control, increased
physical activity and the avoidance or cessation of smoking - plays an
important role in the prevention of CVD.
Recommendation:
•
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle should be started early in life.
•
All individuals above the age of 30 years should have a full lipid profile.
•
Individuals who are at high risk of developing CVD should have a lipid
profile earlier in life (> 18 years of age).

9. Secondary Prevention
9.1 Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)
Patients with CHD may present as stable angina or as acute coronary
syndromes (ACS). ACS is a spectrum of disease ranging from unstable angina
(UA), non- ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to ST elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI) depending on the acuteness and severity of the
coronary occlusion.
9.1.1
Stable CAD
Stable CAD refers to stable angina, asymptomatic MI and coronary
atherosclerosis detected by coronary or CT Angiogram.
Statin therapy should always be considered for individuals with stable CAD.
(Table 2, pg. 18) Irrespective of the LDL-C level, one should aim for on target
treatment LDL-C level of <1.8 mmol/L or a 50% reduction in baseline LDL-C
(whichever is lower). At these levels, clinical studies have showed that
progression
of
atherosclerosis
is
significantly
reduced.132–135,137,186,187
Individuals with stable CAD should be treated with optimal medical therapy
using a combination of antiplatelet agents, statins, β-blockers and angiotensin
converting enzymes inhibitors.256
9.1.1.1 Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)
Early initiation or continuation of high dose statin therapy soon after admission
for ACS is safe and improves outcome regardless of baseline LDL-C
levels.63,257–261
In our local NCVD-ACS Registry, the mean LDL-C on admission was 3.3
mmol/l in males and 3.1 mmol/l in females.2 This indicates that in these Very
High Risk patients, a much lower LDL-C is necessary.
Lipid management includes:
Assessment of a lipid profile for patients who had no previous lipid
measurements. This should be done within 24 hours of hospitalization since
levels will drop after 24 hours of an ACS.

Statins, in the absence of contraindications, should be initiated soon after
admission and continued indefinitely to provide lifelong benefits.108,109 Statin
treatment should not be delayed until lipid levels are available or management
of other modifiable risk factors.
Lipids should be re-tested about 1 to 3 months after ACS.
LDL-C level should be targeted <1.8 mmol/L or a reduction of at least
50%.132-135,137,186,187
9.1.1.2 Post PCI
Pre-treatment with statins 7 days prior to elective PCI has been shown to
reduce post-procedure MI.262
A loading dose of high intensity statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin)
pre-procedure has also been shown to reduce post–procedure MI in
individuals who are statin–naïve and those already on regular statins.263-267
All cardiac patients post-revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG), PCI) should be on long term statin therapy, the dose being adjusted
to achieve a target lipid levels of < 1.8 mmol/L.132–135,186,187 (Table 4, pg. 20)
Recommendations:
•
All patients with CHD should receive high intensity statins as an
integral component of optimal medical therapy.
•
High intensity statin therapy should be started (irrespective of their
baseline cholesterol levels):

on admission in all individuals with ACS

prior to PCI and CABG and continued indefinitely

individuals.270,271
Individuals with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attacks benefit from
lipid modifying therapy.270–272
High intensity statins have been found to prevent recurrent non cardioembolic

Calcium score: ≥ 400 Agatston units
•
Ankle Brachial Index: < 0.9 or > 1.40
•
Significant plaques on carotid ultrasonography (CIMT excluded)
The goal of management in this group of patients is the prevention of CV
events. All risk factors should be treated to target.
High dose statin therapy should be initiated to achieved an LDL-C level of < 1.8
mmol/L or at least 50% reduction from baseline.132–134,137,186,187
Recommendation:
•
Patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease should be on
high intensity statins to achieve an LDL-C level of < 1.8 mmol/L or at
least 50% reduction from baseline.
10.2
Hypertension
The use of lipid lowering drugs (particularly statins) is well established in
patients with high CV risk with or without hypertension.61,108–111
For primary prevention in hypertensive patients, the results have been mixed.
•
In the ALLHAT study high dose pravastatin failed to show any mortality
and CV benefits in high risk hypertensive with mildly elevated blood
pressure even after long term follow up.273 The level of lipid lowering
achieved was however very modest.
•
In the ASCOT study low dose atorvastatin in medium risk hypertensive
patients with moderately elevated BP showed significant reduction in CV
events.61 However in this study, there was no mortality benefits.61 On long
term follow up however, there was a reduction in all-cause mortality,
suggesting a legacy effect.274
•
A meta regression analysis showed that statin therapy effectively
decreased CV morbidity and mortality to the same extent in hypertensive
and non-hypertensive patients.275
I, A
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
Recommendations:
•
Initiate statin therapy for primary prevention in patients with
concurrent hypertension and elevated cholesterols.
•
The target LDL-C level would depend upon the individual’s CV risk
(see Table 4 and 5, pg. 20)
10.3
Diabetes Mellitus
Patients with diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at high risk of
CVD.276,277 These patients have higher mortality and a higher incidence of
recurrent CV events.278 This is especially in individuals with diabetes of more
than 10 years duration.279,280
Dyslipidaemia is common in diabetes. In the National Diabetes Registry
Report (NDR 2009 – 2012), only 28.5% of patients with diabetes in 2012
treated at public primary care clinics achieved TC < 4.5 mmol/L.281 About
62.3% of diabetic patients treated at primary care clinics were receiving
statins.281
Dyslipidaemia is one of the key risk factors contributing to CVD in patients with
diabetes.
Lipid abnormalities differ in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and T2DM.
•
In T1DM, high TG is common. HDL-C levels are often normal and even
high unless glycaemic control is poor or nephropathy is present.
•
In T2DM high plasma TG concentration, reduced HDL-C and increased
levels of small dense LDL particles is the usual pattern.
Statin therapy has been proven to reduce CV events in patients > 40 years
with T2DM irrespective of the baseline LDL-C.59,60,70,108
Among individuals with T1DM without a history of CVD, registry data showed
that statins are associated with a 22 - 44% reduction in risk of CVD and CV
death.282

Screening
In adult patients with diabetes, a lipid profile should be measured at least
annually and more often if needed to achieve goals.283
In adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L, HDL-C >1.0 mmol/L in
males and >1.3 mmol/L in females and TG <1.7 mmol/L), lipid assessments
may be repeated every year.283
In adolescents with T2DM, screening for lipid disorders should be done at
diagnosis after glycaemic control is achieved. If normal lipid values are
obtained, screening should be repeated every 2 years.283,284
Lipid Targets in Diabetes
The primary target of therapy is LDL-C59,60,70,108 (see Table 5, pg. 20).
All persons with diabetes above the age of 40 should be on a statin.59,60,70,108
All persons with diabetes and CVD should be on a high intensity statin from the
time of the CV event.59,60,70,108
In patients who have achieved LDL-C targets, the following are secondary
targets of therapy:262
•
Non-HDL–C
< 3.4 mmol/L (when TG > 4.5 mmol/L)
•
HDL-C
> 1.0 mmol/L for males, > 1.2 mmol/L for females
•
TG
< 1.7 mmol/L
Recommendations:
•
All patients with diabetes > 40 years should be treated with a statin
regardless of baseline LDL-C levels
•
The target LDL-C levels will depend upon their CV risk (Table 4 & 5,
pg. 20)
10.4
Heart Failure
Heart failure (HF) is associated with a higher risk of CV death and recurrent
hospital admissions.
In patients with CHD, cholesterol lowering with statin reduces the incidence
of HF.243,285–287
I, A
I, A
I, A
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
Patients with chronic HF however usually have a low TC which is usually
associated with a poorer prognosis.285
Most statin trials have excluded patients with HF.288 Rosuvastatin showed a
reduction in the rate of CV hospitalisation in patients with HF of ischemic
aetiology.289
All patients with HF due to CHD should be on statins.243,285–287
Routine use of cholesterol-lowering therapy with statins is not recommended
in non-ischemic HF.289
Recommendations:
•
All patients with HF due to CHD should be on statins
•
Routine use of cholesterol-lowering therapy is not recommended in
non-ischemic HF
10.5
Renal Disease
Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for CV morbidity
and mortality.101,104,290,291 CVD is the most common cause of death in these
patients. They should be screened for the traditional CV risk factors and
treated appropriately.
Dyslipidaemia can occur in all stages of CKD, on dialysis, after renal
transplantation and in nephrotic syndrome.
The main lipid abnormality in CKD is elevated TG and low HDL-C. TC is
usually normal or low.292,293
In nephrotic syndrome, both TC and LDL-C are elevated. The lipid
abnormalities may improve or resolve when the renal problem is successfully
treated. If dyslipidaemia persists, drug therapy should be considered.
Caution must be exercised when starting lipid lowering therapy in patients with
CKD.294,295 The initiating dose of statin or fibrates should be lower. (Table 14,
pg. 69)

Table 14: Dosing modifications for lipid-lowering drugs in CKD
Statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality, CV mortality and
non-fatal CV events in primary and secondary prevention.297,298
Ezetimibe/Simvastatin also showed significant reduction (17%) of major
atherosclerotic events in patients with CKD Stage 3-5.232
End stage kidney disease patients on dialysis have not had similar benefits of
lipid lowering therapy.299,300
In patients with established CVD already on statins or an ezetimibe/statin
combination at the time of initiation of dialysis, these drugs should be
continued.
Statin should not be commenced for primary prevention of CVD in patients on
dialysis.299,300
Lipid modifying therapy has not been shown to retard the progression of CKD
or reduce proteinuria.301,302
Recommendations:
•
Lipid lowering therapy with statins or ezetimibe/simvastatin
combination should be initiated in CKD patients for primary and
secondary prevention of CVD.
•
The target LDL-C levels will depend upon their CV risk (Table 4 & 5,
pg. 20)
•
Statins should not be commenced for primary prevention of CVD in
patients on dialysis.
•
In patients with established CVD already on statins or an
ezetimibe/statin combination at the time of initiation of dialysis, these
drugs should be continued.

Specific Lipid Disorders
10.6.1 Elevated TG
Hypertriglyceridemia has a modest association as a CVD risk factor14,77–80, but
the association is far weaker than for hypercholesterolaemia.77 Unfortunately,
despite this correlation, there have been no randomized interventional trials
with sufficient evidence to recommend specific targets for TG.
Data favour the role of TG-rich lipoproteins as the risk factor for CVD.303 Data
from large prospective studies have found that non-fasting TG predict CHD
risk and mortality, more strongly than fasting TG77–80,304,305, indicative of
insulin resistance and atherogenic remnant lipoproteins.
Associations were strongest with postprandial TG taken 2 to 4 h after the meal.
Unfortunately, the lack of standardization and reference ranges impedes the
general implementation of nonfasting TG as target for control.306
At present, fasting TG > 1.7 mmol/L continue to be considered a marker of
increased risk, but concentrations ≤ 1.7 mmol/L are not evidence-based target
levels for therapy.
10.6.1.1
Targets of Therapy
In individuals with elevated TG, the primary target of therapy remains
achieving LDL-C goal depending upon the individual’s global risk.108–111
When TG levels are > 1.5 mmol/L, reported LDL-C levels do not
reliably indicate LDL particle number.307
Individuals with a TG > 4.5 mmol/L should have a repeat lipid panel
tested in the fasting state.
In individuals where the TG > 2.3 mmol/L, non-HDL-C is more representative
of all atherogenic lipoproteins than LDL-C. (See also section 2 and 4.4) In
these individuals, the secondary target of therapy is non-HDL-C.242,308 (Table 6,
pg. 21).
I, A
IIa, B
Edition of
Clinical Practice Guidelines
5
th
I, B
71
In individuals where the TG > 4.5 mmol/L, non-HDL-C is the primary target of
therapy.12 (Table 6, pg 21).
10.6.1.2
Management of Elevated TG
In individuals with mixed hyperlipidaemia, the primary target of therapy is to
achieve LDL-C goal.108–111
In those individuals with:
•
TG between 2.3 and 4.5 mmo/L the secondary target of therapy is
non-HDL-C242,308
•
TG > 4.5mmol/L, the primary target of therapy is non-HDL-C.12
a) Mild-to-moderate Elevations in TG (>1.7–<10.0 mmol/L)
Treatment should include:
•
Lifestyle changes of weight reduction, low carbohydrate diet, control of
diabetes or insulin resistance, exercise, reduction of alcohol intake and
cessation of smoking.309–316
•
Ensure diabetes, if present is controlled.
•
Drug therapy should be considered in high risk individuals. There are two
options to achieve targets:
 Intensifying statin therapy, especially if LDL-C target is not
achieved.317 Statins have significant effects on mortality as well as
most CVD outcome parameters, these drugs are the first choice to
reduce both total CVD risk and moderately elevated TG levels. More
potent
statins
(atorvastatin,
rosuvastatin,
and
pitavastatin)
demonstrate a robust lowering of TG levels, especially at high doses.
 Adding fibrates as a combination therapy to statin.242,318,319
 Caution should be exercised when gemfibrozil is used in combination
with statins because of the significant risk of rhabdomyolysis.246,247
There are no outcome data that show a reduction in CVD events with the use
of drug therapy to reduce TG.76,82,245

b) Severe Elevations in TG (> 10mmol/L)
In asymptomatic individuals:
•
repeat fasting TG measurement (after an interval of 5 days, but within 2
weeks) and
•
review for potential secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia and seek
specialist advice if the TG concentration remains above 10 mmol/L.20
In these individuals:
•
The drug of choice is statins.
•
Fish oil which contain long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
can also lower TG. Doses of 3 to 4 gm per day can lower TG by 20-50%.316
•
Very low carbohydrate and low fat diets (≤15% of calorie intake) and
lifestyle changes (See Section 7.1).309,316,320
In patients who have suspected pancreatitis, treatment includes:
•
Fibrate or nicotinic acid
 Gemfibrozil and Fenofibrate lower TG by about 20-35%.195
 Nicotinic acid at doses of above 1.5 gm per day can reduce TG by
40%.321
•
Severe hypertriglyceridemia associated with uncontrolled diabetes
warrants initiation of intravenous (IV) insulin infusion. IV insulin stimulates
intravascular lipoprotein lipase that helps to clear TG at a faster rate. The
TG level will improve within 2-5 days, but may not normalize.
10.6.2 Low HDL-C and High TG:
Low HDL-C and high TG are seen in insulin resistance states (e.g. T2DM,
abdominal obesity), physical inactivity and high carbohydrate intakes. This lipid
pattern is associated with small dense atherogenic LDL-particles. HDL-C < 1.0
mmol/L (men) and < 1.3 mmol/L (women) is considered a marker of increased
CV risk.283
Treatment of this dyslipidaemia in individuals with high/very high CV risk is
aimed at lowering LDL-C to target.322

th
Pharmacological manipulation of HDL-C has not improved CV outcomes. At
present, there is inadequate data to recommend the use of additional
lipid-modifying therapies beyond statins.76
Results of a meta-analysis suggest a nominal benefit in the subgroup of
patients with high TG/low HDL-C levels at baseline (heterogeneous
populations from 5 trials).323
10.6.3 Low HDL-C
Recent studies have cast doubt on the causal role of HDL-C in CVD.324
Modifying lifestyle with increased physical activity314,325 and dietary modification
(reduction in simple carbohydrate, sucrose/fructose consumption), weight
reduction, smoking cessation326, rather than drug treatment, is recommended
for increasing HDL levels.
Recommendation:
•
In patients with high TG and/or low HDL-C, the primary goal of
treatment is lowering LDL-C to target. (Table 2 pg. 18)
10.7
HIV
With the advent of good and effective therapy for Human Immuno-deficiency
Virus (HIV), CVD has become an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
these patients.327 This may be due to:
•
HIV infection itself which may produce a cardiometabolic type of
syndrome,
•
metabolic changes associated with anti-retroviral therapy (ART)
•
Associated CV risk factors such as smoking and recreational drug use
(e.g. cocaine)327–330
When treating dyslipidaemia in patients with HIV, the following are important:
•
LDL-C remains the primary target of therapy.331 (Table 4, pg. 20)
•
Suggested statin therapy:
 Pravastatin has a good safety profile, has limited interaction with ART
and is currently the longest used statin in these patients.331
IIb, B
IIa, B
I, A
I, B
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
 Rosuvastatin is recommended if a greater reduction in LDL-C levels
is needed.332,333
 Lovastatin is contraindicated in patients on a protease inhibitor (PI)334.
 Atorvastatin can be used, but a lower dose (10-20 mg) is
recommended especially in the presence of ART in combination with
a booster in the form of cobisistat. This increases the effect of the
atorvastatin. In other circumstance, a higher dosing is safe.
•
If the patient is statin intolerant or LDL-C target has not been achieved
despite maximally tolerated dose, ezetimibe can be considered.335
•
Monitoring for side effects is vital. Liver function test has to be done
regularly. Symptoms of muscle soreness or myopathy, neurologic
complications, blood sugar and diabetes should be routinely evaluated.
•
Hepatitis C co-infection is common in HIV patients, and care must be taken
regarding the interactions between statins and Hepatitis C medication.
TG may be very high in these patients as a consequence of therapy.
Suggested drug therapy:
•
Fenofibrates are preferred because there is no significant interaction with
ART
•
Gemfibrozil may have a lower efficacy due to interaction with PI.
•
Fish oils at a high dose of 4 g per day.336
Recommendations:
•
In patients with HIV, LDL-C is the primary goal of treatment. (Table 4
pg. 20)
•
Drug interactions with ART is common and monitoring for adverse
effects is important.

11. Management in Specific Groups
11.1
Women
Women develop heart disease about 10 to 15 years later than men.337–339 There
are no gender differences in the risk factors that predispose to CVD although
women with T2DM are at higher risk of CVD than men.340–343 In premenopausal
women, CVD tends to occur in those with T2DM and multiple CV risk factors.
In secondary prevention, women have similar benefits on CV outcomes as
men.60,64,108,109
Statins should be the drug of first choice.60,64,108,109
Statins should not be used in women who are pregnant, intend to become
pregnant or who are breastfeeding. However bile acid sequestrants may be
considered.
In primary prevention, the cornerstone of management is lifestyle modification
with advice on a healthy diet and physical activity.
Women at high risk who do not achieve their target LDL-C levels should be
treated with statins for primary prevention.110,111,231 Benefits are similar in both
gender.
11.2
Children and Adolescents
Cholesterol levels, including LDL-C and non HDL-C are low at birth, increase
in the first two years, peak prior to adolescence and reduce during adolescence
(age <18).344
Risk factors for atherosclerosis in this age group include:
•
Genetic dyslipidaemia such as familial hypercholesterolemia.345
•
Overweight or obese
•
Kawasaki’s disease
•
Nephrotic syndrome
•
CKD
•
Type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus
•
Chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous
(SLE)
I, A
III, C
I, B
I, A
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
•
HIV
•
Cigarette smoking
These high risk patients should have a full lipid profile.
The main approach is a healthy lifestyle with appropriate diet, maintenance of
“desirable weight” and regular exercise.
Children whose lipid levels are significantly elevated may have a genetic
dyslipidaemia and should be referred to specialists interested in this field.
In patients with FH, statins are the drug of choice. All statins can be used as an
adjunct to diet, in children >10 years of age.346,347 Pravastatin can be used in >
8 years of age.346,347
When prescribing drugs in children, the need for life long therapy and its
associated health risks and drug exposure during unplanned pregnancy in
individuals of child bearing age need to be considered. Patients should be
extensively counselled prior to initiation of drug therapy.
There has been increasing risk for T2DM in adolescents. Thus, the risk of new
onset diabetes should also be considered when prescribing statins in children
with risk factors for diabetes.348
11.3
Elderly
Increasing age is a major risk factor for CVD and death.
For secondary prevention, the elderly derive a greater absolute benefit from
lipid lowering therapy.108,109,349 Thus, they should not be deprived from lipid
lowering therapy solely on the basis of their age although there is limited
clinical trial data in patients over the age of 80 years.
In primary prevention, a meta-analysis of subjects > 65 years of age350 showed
that statin treatment reduced MI and stroke. Statin therapy should be
considered in older adults free from CVD, particularly in the presence of
hypertension, smoking, diabetes and dyslipidaemia.108,109,351
IIa, B
I, A

th
IIa, C
77
Since older people have co-morbidities and have altered pharmacokinetics,
lipid lowering medication should be started at a lower dose and then titrated
with caution to achieve target lipid levels.
Few areas in CVD prevention are more controversial than the mass use of
statins in the elderly. There is no evidence of decreasing effectiveness of
statins in patients >75 years of age.285
Evidence supporting effectiveness in individuals >80 years of age is very
limited. A recent trial suggested no harm of stopping statins in the elderly with
a limited life expectancy.352 Taken together, the recommendations of
cholesterol-lowering treatment in the elderly should be followed with caution
and common sense, adverse effects should be monitored closely and
treatment should be reconsidered periodically.
Recommendations:
•
The goals of lipid lowering therapy is similar in both gender and in
the elderly. Target LDL-C levels will depend on the global CV risk
(Table 2, pg 18)
•
When prescribing lipid lowering therapy in the elderly, the presence
of co-morbidities and altered pharmacokinetics should be
considered. Lipid lowering medication should be started at a lower
dose and then titrated with caution to achieve target lipid levels.
•
Children whose lipid levels are significantly elevated may have a
genetic dyslipidaemia and should be referred to specialists interested
in this field.

12. Adherence to Lifestyle Changes and Medications
It has been well documented that there is a lack of adherence to CV preventive
therapy. A number of scientific studies have shown that adherence among patients
with chronic disease is only about 50%.353
Lack of adherence threatens the success of the guideline recommendation and
implementation. The amount of risk reduction achieved is related to the level of
adherence to treatment. Compared with poor adherence, good adherence was
associated with lower mortality.354 More importantly, lack of adherence leads to
missed opportunity for the risk reducing benefits of the treatment, thus creating
enormous costs to the health system for treating CV events that could have been
prevented.353
The reasons for the high discontinuation rate and missed doses are complex and
multifactorial
and
may
include
both
intentional
and
unintentional
non-adherence.355–358 These include:
•
cost of medication
•
affordability
•
unclear label instructions
•
patient forgetfulness
•
adverse effects from medication that patient is too embarrassed to discuss with
doctor
•
patient does not like the idea of having to take medication
•
patient does not understand the importance of a given medication for a
condition for which he or she has no symptoms
•
patient-practitioner relationship is suboptimal
•
polypharmacy and complexity of regimen
To improve adherence and compliance the following are recommended:357,358
•
Patient factors
 Simplify medication regimens using wherever possible drugs with a single
daily or twice daily dosing
 Give clear instructions
 Encourage the support of the family
 Involve patients in their care through self-monitoring
 Remind patients that lipid lowering drugs are not a substitute for dietary
and lifestyle interventions

•
Physician Factors
 Teach physicians to implement lipid treatment guidelines
 Educate patients to prompt preventive care
 Remind patients of appointments and follow-up missed appointments
•
Health Delivery System
 Involve pharmacists, dieticians and other health care deliverers in patient
education
 Refer patients to medication therapy adherence clinic (MTAC)
 Use mass media for patient education
 Disseminate clinical guidelines and clinical pathways to health care
providers
 Standardize reference values in all laboratories to recommended
Malaysian guidelines
Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017
13. Performance Measures
In accordance with the National Strategic Plan on Non-Communicable Disease,
performance indicators should be put in place. This CPG recommends the following
audit parameters:
Primary Prevention - At Klinik Kesihatan (for follow up patients only)
•
Was a CV risk stratification performed?
 Numerator: number of adult > 30 years who were risk stratified
 Denominator: number of adult > 30 years seen at that clinic session
•
Was a lipid profile measured?
 Numerator: number of adult > 30 years whose lipid profile was measured
 Denominator: number of adult > 30 years seen at that clinic session
•
Was the LDL-C target of the individual noted?
 Numerator: number of adult > 30 years with the LDL-C target stated in the
clinical notes
 Denominator: number of adult > 30 years seen at that clinic session
•
Did the individual attain the LDL-C target?
 Numerator: number of adult > 30 years who achieved the LDL-C target
 Denominator: number of adult > 30 years seen at that clinic session who
had a lipid target stated < 6 months prior to current visit
Secondary Prevention - At follow up in cardiac clinic/general medical clinic (within 3
months of discharge after an admission for ACS/Stable CHD)
•
Is the patient on a statin?
 Numerator: number of patients who were discharged on statins
 Denominator: number of patients seen at that clinic session who had
ACS/Stable CHD
•
Did the individual attain the LDL-C target?
 Numerator: number of patients who achieved the LDL-C target
 Denominator: number of patients seen at that clinic session who had
ACS/Stable CHD
An initial audit should be performed to determine baseline performance indicators.
Suggest an initial target of 60% with an incremental improvement in performance
indicators when reassessed at yearly intervals.
Reasons for non-achievement of the above targets should also be determined.
Following this corrective measures should be taken.

What is the role of
non-statin therapy
in dyslipidaemia
Evidence
Grade
Cholesterol and
heart disease
Is cholesterol an important cause of heart disease?
• The role of serum cholesterol in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and CVD is unequivocal and irrefutable.
• The question is whether eating food high in cholesterol leads
to high serum cholesterol and LDL-C, and whether limiting
dietary cholesterol intake lowers serum LDL-C.
• Recent data indicate that the impact of dietary cholesterol on
serum cholesterol levels is weak.
Statins safety
Statins are safe. Its side effects are uncommon, self-limiting, are
reversible, and have no long term sequelae
I, A
Fish oil
supplements
• It may be useful in the treatment of elevated triglycerides.
• Fish oils is not a replacement for statins in the treatment of
elevated LDL-C.
IIa, B
III, A
Co-enzyme Q10
No definitive evidence to support the use of Co-enzyme Q10 on
the reduction of cholesterol level and primary prevention of
CVD.359,360

Complementary and alternative therapies:
Estrogen and
progestins
Hormone replacement is not indicated for primary or secondary
prevention of CVD
III, A
Red yeast rice
• Red yeast rice contains substances that are structurally
identical to statins.
• Unlike statins, there is no data on its safety in long term use.
IIb, C
Garlic
Natural Medicine Comprehensive Database recently downgraded
garlic to a rating of “Possibly ineffective”. Garlic can also cause
drug interactions and increased risk of bleeding.361,362
IIb, B
Apple cider
vinegar
There is no evidence at present for CV protection
III, C
Virgin coconut oil,
or coconut oil
• Not supported by robust scientific evidence when taken on its
own.
• It worsens the lipid profile.
• The saturated fatty acids in coconut oil increase total-C, LDLC, and HDL-C.363
• One tablespoon of coconut oil contains 12
g of saturated fat
and 1 tablespoon of virgin coconut oil contains 13
g of
saturated fat.364
• Either would, therefore, contribute a significant portion of the
recommended total daily saturated fat limit of <10% of energy
• If coconut oil is used as part of a daily eating plan and/or in
food preparation, it is recommended that it be used within the
context of a healthy dietary pattern
