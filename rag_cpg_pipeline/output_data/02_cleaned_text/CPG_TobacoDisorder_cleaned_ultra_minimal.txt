FOREWORD
One in two smokers will eventually die as a result of their addiction to nicotine in
Malaysia. In absolute numbers, more than 20,000 Malaysians die annually as a
result of their smoking habit. It is estimated that 43.0% of men and 1.4% of
women, above the age of 15, smoke in Malaysia. These figures are still alarmingly
high and more needs to be done to help smokers to quit, especially if Malaysia is
to achieve the global World Health Organization Non-Communicable Diseases
(WHO NCD) target to achieve smoking prevalence of 15% by the year 2025.
We have now reached a point where the majority of smokers are aware that
smoking is not good for their health but have difficulty quitting. Globally and
nationally, the majority of current smokers would like to give up smoking. As a
party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Malaysia
is committed to strengthen the smoking cessation services, as stipulated in Article
14 FCTC. Hence, this Clinical Practice Guideline was developed to ensure
smokers gets the latest evidenced-based treatment there are to ensure higher
quit smoking success rate. Helping our fellow Malaysian smokers to beat their
nicotine addiction is beneficial for both short and long-term personal and national
gains. Last but not least, I would like to thank the CPG committee members and
many others that have contributed to the development of this CPG.
Towards a healthy and smokefree Malaysian generation!
(DATUK SERI DR. S. SUBRAMANIAM)
Minister of Health Malaysia
FOREWORD
Nicotine addiction is one of the hardest addictions to break but nonetheless, every
year, many smokers managed to break away from this addiction. However, a
national survey in 2016 revealed that nearly 80% of former smokers quit unaided,
without any professional intervention. This figure is worrying, as studies
repeatedly show that quitting unaided yield the lowest success rate of being
smokefree, hence many smokers needed 7-8 attempts before successfully
becoming ex-smokers.
Most government Health Clinics and major hospitals in Malaysia have smoking
cessation services and now, with the introduction of mQuit Services, this service
is also available in the private sector, through some community pharmacies,
general practices or other institutions. Our challenge now is how to attract fellow
Malaysians who smoke to visit our smoking cessation services and deliberate on
how they can be guided to quit properly. Smoking cessation services should
entice as many smokers as possible, who are otherwise coming to health care
facilities for other health services anyway.
A national survey conducted in 2016 among Malaysian adolescents aged 10 ‚Äì 19
years old (Tobacco and Electronic Cigarette Survey among Malaysian Adolescent
‚Äì TECMA) found that an alarming 78.7% of ever smokers had their first cigarette
before the age of 14 years old. The same study also show that 28.5% of the
current adolescent smokers have already developed low nicotine dependence.
More often than not, their nicotine dependence will only get stronger by the time
they enter their working life.
Therefore, it is high time for healthcare providers to promote and attract young
adult smokers to think about quitting and to at least discuss about quitting with the
help of healthcare professionals. Our data showed that young adults are the least
likely to enquire about quitting, while their tobacco disorder is probably easier to
treat in comparison to older and more mature smokers. Our smoking cessation
services must do more to appeal to younger Malaysian smokers to come to the
services.
Malaysia is committed towards our obligations with the World Health Organisation
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). We are also
committed to achieve the WHO Global Non-Communicable Diseases target which
is to achieve smoking prevalence of 15% or less by the year 2025. In the
meantime, the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030 requires parties to
strengthen their implementation of FCTC activities, including helping smokers to
quit smoking.
I would like to congratulate the CPG Development Group for updating the older
CPG of Treatment of the Tobacco Use and Dependence to the current CPG on
Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder. I hope that all health care providers will
utilise this Clinical Guidelines to provide safe and effective smoking cessation
services for smokers to quit successfully. Together, we can help to further
improving the health of our nation!
Yours sincerely,
(DATUK DR NOOR HISHAM BIN ABDULLAH)

Ministry of Health Malaysia
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Tobacco use is recognized as the main cause of premature and preventable death
in our country. It is estimated that 20,000 deaths in Malaysia are attributed to
smoking annually. Tobacco dependency does not only cause physical withdrawal,
it also causes lifelong addiction. Hence, due recognition should be given to it as
a chronic disease. Malaysia has a high prevalence of smokers especially among
the males and adolescents. However, despite the high prevalence of tobacco use,
healthcare providers are not well trained to manage this problem effectively.
Furthermore, health care providers lack the knowledge and awareness that
treating tobacco dependence is more cost effective as compared to treating
tobacco related diseases.
Since the launch of the Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on Treatment of
Tobacco Use and Dependence 2003 by the Ministry of Health, there have been
several new evidences based developments in the smoking cessation services
which are highlighted in this update. For example, there are changes or
introduction of new cessation pharmaceutical aids, combination use of
pharmaceutical aids, new scientific evidence of behavioural therapies and now
the emergence of electronic nicotine and non-nicotine devices, such as Vape. The
approach towards tobacco use or nicotine addiction has also changed whereby it
is now considered a medical condition that requires medical attention. Hence, it is
very timely for the 2003 CPG to be updated to the CPG of Tobacco Use and
Disorder 2016.
The objective of this CPG remains the same. It is to provide the latest and updated
treatment protocols to assist health care providers in managing tobacco use and
dependence effectively.
This guideline was based on a combination of two methods. The first part was
where three leading and prominent international CPGs on tobacco cessation were
used as references and the second was inclusion of the latest literature based on
a systematic search of the evidence. All recommendations in this CPG are
graded based on the appropriate level of evidence and are specific and
unambiguous. The health benefits, adverse effects and risks of all recommended
pharmacological agents are detailed in tables throughout this document. The
overall treatment guideline is provided in a clinical pathway format. Furthermore,
the effectiveness and health benefits derived from each recommendation in this
CPG are taken into consideration.
Both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches towards achieving
smoking cessation are equally important and the skills involved must be grasped
by cessation providers. There are several standardised behavioural approaches
such as 5A, 5R and STAR to help cessation providers to assist their clients. When
these behavioural approaches are combined with pharmacological intervention,
the quit rate is further increased. Combination pharmacological interventions
which might include the combination of NRTs or with a non-NRT medication can
further increase the success rate. Therefore, the treatment approach should be
tailored to the individual smoker and care be given when treating certain special
populations.
It is hoped that clinicians and other allied healthcare providers will adopt this
evidence ‚Äì based guideline to maximize the success rate of tobacco cessation in
their respective services. This CPG, however, is not meant as a substitute for
clinical judgement and clinicians are recommended to individualize their treatment
strategies where appropriate.
Evaluation of this CPG would include an assessment of the number of smoking
cessation services and the outcome of smokers treated throughout Malaysia.
Studies to look at improvement in standard of practice regarding smoking
cessation treatment will be conducted. Local research and analysis of Malaysian
smoking and tobacco use scenario should be encouraged to improve our
understanding towards improving the smoking cessation in our country.
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
This guideline is based on a combination of two methods; firstly, three clinical
practice guidelines (CPGs) as mentioned below were used as main references
and secondly, latest literature review was incorporated in the development of this
guideline.
The main references were from:
A. Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence 2008, US Department of Health
and Human services (Citation 2008) .
B. The New Zealand Guidelines for Helping People to Stop Smoking.
Wellington: Ministry of Health 2014.
C. CAN-ADAPTT. Canadian Smoking Cessation Clinical Practice Guideline,
Toronto, Canada: Canadian Action Network for the Advancement,
Dissemination and Adoption of Practice-informed Tobacco Treatment,
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health 2011.
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The members of the Development Group (DG) for these CPG were from the
Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Higher Education, private medical hospital
and Non-Governmental Organisation. There was active involvement of a
multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG
development.
A literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases:
Guidelines International Network (G-I-N); Medline via Ovid, PubMed and
Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) (refer to Appendix 1 for
Example of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria are all literature on treatment
on tobacco use disorder regardless of study designs. The search was limited to
literature published in the last 15 years, humans and English. In addition, the
reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further
identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify
relevant studies. In certain situations, pivotal papers beyond the scope of search
were used in the CPG. All searches were conducted from 30th July 2014 to 30th
March 2016. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the
end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published
before 30th June 2016 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence
published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained
upon request from the CPG Secretariat.
Reference was also made to other CPG on treatment of Tobacco use disorder
such as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - Smoking and
tobacco: smoking cessation in mental health services, recommendation for all
patients with mental illness who smoke from European Psychiatric Association
(EPA). The CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research
and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.
A total of 17 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members
of the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. (Refer to
Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions).
The CPG committee members met 14 times throughout the development of these
guidelines. The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members
using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables
and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and recommendations
formulated after that were agreed upon by the DG. Where evidence was
insufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the DG. Any
differences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely
on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, with local
practices taken into consideration.
On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It was
also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from any interested
parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for
CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval.
This CPG has been developed to serve as a useful tool for doctors and other
health professionals and students in Malaysia to treat tobacco use in various
settings, including hospitals, clinics or pharmacies.
LEVELS OF EVIDENCE SCALE AND GRADES OF RECOMMENDATION
The literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/Canadian
Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of
recommendation was based on the US Government Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research (AHCPR) ABC Grade of Recommendation. In formulating
the recommendations, overall balances of the following aspects are considered in
determining the strengths of the recommendations:-
‚ñ™ Overall quality of evidence

MONITORING FOR TREATMENT OF TOBACCO USE DEPENDENCE
Definition of a quitter - A smoker is considered to have been successfully quit
smoking if he has been abstinent without even a single puff of cigarette for at least
six months from the last cigarette (which is also his Quit Date).
Six month is a typical period of time for measuring successful smoking cessation.
A ‚ÄòQuit Rate‚Äô for any treatment centre is defined as the proportion of tobacco users
who managed abstinent from smoking for at least 6 months, among those who
attempted to quit smoking.
A typical six month Quit Rate for an institution is calculated using the following
formula:
Quit rate
:
Number of successful quitters in the current six
month period (e.g. Jan ‚Äì Jun)
X 100%
Number of smokers who have set their quit dates in
previous six month period (e.g. previous Jul ‚Äì Dec)

INTRODUCTION
Tobacco use is the single greatest preventable cause of death in the world today
and the World Health Organization has demonstrated that tobacco use is a
contributing risk factor for 6 of the 8 leading causes of death, worldwide1, Level III. In
Malaysia, smoking kills 20,000 Malaysians every year and will increase to 30,000
by the year 2020 if the pattern of smoking does not change.
Malaysia is a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO
FCTC) since its enforcement in September 2005. Article 14 of the WHO FCTC
demands that ‚Äúeach Party shall develop and disseminate appropriate,
comprehensive and integrated guidelines based on scientific evidence and best
practices, taking into account national circumstances and priorities, and shall take
effective measures to promote cessation of tobacco use and adequate treatment
for tobacco dependence‚Äù. Strengthening tobacco cessation is core to the ‚ÄòO - Offer
help to quit tobacco use‚Äô component of the MPOWER strategy of the WHO FCTC
2, Level I.
Malaysia is committed to achieve its WHO Global NCD Target 2025, which is to
reduce national smoking prevalence by 30% from the baseline in 2011. There are
two main strategies to achieve this, which are to reduce smoking initiation among
youths and to help existing smokers to beat their nicotine addiction.
A National Strategic Plan on Tobacco Control has been developed by the Ministry
of Health in 2015, incorporating the MPOWER strategy for co-ordinating tobacco in
Malaysia3, Level III. Strengthening tobacco cessation services is given priority, with
development of a standardised services across the public and private practices ‚Äì
‚Äòthe mQuit Services‚Äô as one the activities. This Clinical Practice Guideline is
essential for delivery of uniformed tobacco cessation services through the mQuit
Services.
Nicotine is highly addictive and some researchers have placed nicotine dependence
as comparable to the dependence caused by opiates, cocaine, or other illicit drugs4,
Level I. Effective pharmacologic and counselling strategies are now the pillars of
tobacco cessation programmes, and taken in combination can achieve the highest
rates of smoking cessation5, Level III. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims
primarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive
symptoms while counselling or behavioural support aims to boost or support
motivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people‚Äôs capacity to implement
their plans to avoid smoking6, Level III.
Most smokers believe that stopping smoking is purely a matter of willpower and
remain unaware of effective treatments to promote quitting. It is important that
health care providers whom often treat smokers to be familiar with available
therapies to educate patients of their options for smoking cessation.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TOBACCO USE
The trend of current cigarette smoking among Malaysian adults is summarised as
per Table 1 below. Overall, there is a slight downtrend of prevalence of cigarette
smoking in Malaysia and this trend is more considerable among males.

Adapted from Tee et al. 20167
The overall prevalence of smoked any tobacco products for Malaysians aged 15
year old and above was 22.6%; of which 20.1% smoked manufactured cigarette,
2.3% smoked hand-rolled cigarettes and 0.2% smoked other smoked tobacco8, Level
III.
A vast majority of Malaysian smokers were aware of harmful effects of smoking and
78% of these smokers had plans to quit at some point in the future, with 29% having
plans to quit in the next six months9, Level II-3.
Among the Malaysian youths, the 2009 Global Youth Tobacco Survey found that
19.5% of 13 to 15 year olds use some form of tobacco products with 18.2% smoking
cigarettes and 9.5% using other tobacco products. In 2016, the prevalence of
tobacco use among adolescents age 13-15 year old in Malaysia has reduced to
14.8%10, Level III.

ASSESSMENT OF TOBACCO SMOKING
The first step in treating tobacco use disorder is to identify tobacco users. The
identification of smokers itself increases rates of clinician intervention. Hospitals
provide a good setting to implement smoking cessation intervention. However
issues of accessibility and availability of the medication, dedicated staff, operating
days and equipment have to be solved11, 12. Effective identification of tobacco use
status not only opens the door for successful interventions (e.g., clinician advice
and treatment), but also guides clinicians to identify appropriate interventions based
on patients‚Äô tobacco use status and willingness to quit. The Guideline recommends
that all health care providers use the opportunity at every encounter to assess and
intervene all patients.
The assessments are to look for:
Level of addiction (using Modified Fagerstr√∂m Test for Cigarette Dependence
Questionnaire) (See Appendix 3) and smoking status verified with carbon monoxide
(CO) in expired breath air. Exhaled CO was proved to be a useful tool in predicting
nicotine dependence and to motivate smokers to quit13, Level I.
Screening for current or past tobacco use will result in four possible responses:
A. The patient uses tobacco and is now willing to make a quit attempt;
B. The patient uses tobacco but is now not willing to make a quit attempt;
C. The patient once used tobacco but has since quit;
D. The patient never regularly used tobacco.

CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR TOBACCO USE DISORDER
There are two types of clinical intervention depending on the intensity of intervention
and level of service provided. They are:
i. Brief clinical intervention
ii. Intensive clinical intervention
4.1
Brief Clinical Intervention for Tobacco Use Disorder
4.1.1 For All Smokers
Brief clinical intervention by the physician increases quit rates effectively14, Level I. It
is vital to change clinical culture and practice patterns to ensure that every patient
who uses tobacco is identified and offered treatment.
The five major steps (5 A‚Äôs) for intervention are described below and summarised
in Table 1. The strategies are designed to be brief and minimal health care
provider‚Äôs time is required15,16,17.
These brief opportunistic advices typically involve asking patients about their current
smoking, advising them to stop, offering assistance either by providing further
advice, a referral to a specialist service or recommendation of or a prescription for
pharmacotherapy or arranging a follow up wherever it is appropriate. The focus of
this opportunistic advice is to increase smokers‚Äô motivation to quit in improving
success rate of quitting18. This brief intervention has been proven to increase overall
tobacco abstinence rates regardless he or she is referred to an intensive
intervention19,20 Level I,21 Level III.
The steps involved in the delivery of brief intervention include:
Step 1: Ask about tobacco smoking
ALL patients should be asked about their smoking status and the findings should
be documented in the patient‚Äôs notes. This should be delivered opportunistically
during routine consultations to all smokers regardless whether they are seeking help
to stop smoking. For people who smoke or have recently stopped smoking, the
smoking status should be checked and updated at every visit to prevent relapse.
Systems should be in place in all health care settings to ensure that smoking status
is accurately documented at every visit (20, Level I; 6, Level I)
Step 2: Advice to quit
Advice to quit should be given clearly to all patients found to be smoking. Studies
have shown that advise by health care providers (medical, dental, pharmacist,
nurses etc.) increases rates of abstinence. There is a strong dose-response
relationship between the session length of person-to-person contact and
successful treatment outcomes20, Level I.
Multiple efforts by health care providers can increase these rates further. Every
tobacco user should be offered at least a brief intervention which consists of brief
cessation advice from the health care providers. However, intensive interventions
are more effective than brief interventions and should be used whenever possible
as smokers‚Äô motivation, beliefs and feeling about smoking and quitting is always
conflicting18, Level III. Face to face treatment delivered for four or more sessions
appears especially effective in increasing abstinence rates22, Level I. Therefore, if
feasible, treatment providers should strive to meet four or more times with
individuals quitting tobacco use.
Health care workers should be provided with appropriate training to enable them to
provide brief advice. This training should include providing the health care worker
with information on available evidence-based smoking cessation treatments19.
Step 3: Assess willingness to make a quit attempt
Health care providers involved with tobacco treatment should assess the
willingness to begin treatment to quit.
Though there is a lack of evidence for greater effectiveness of stage based
approaches23, Level I, stages of change model provides a useful framework to help
health care providers to identify smokers and assist smokers in quitting24, Level III.
There is some evidence that the likelihood of success in an attempt to quit is
unrelated to the smoker‚Äôs expressed interest in quitting in the period leading up to
the attempt ‚Äì unplanned attempts to quit are as likely (or even more likely) to be as
successful as planned attempts25, Level III; 26, Level III. Thus, there is benefit in
encouraging all smokers to consider quitting whenever the opportunity arises20, Level
I.
Step 4: Assist in quit attempt
All patients should be assisted to quit. Brief advice as short as 30 seconds and selfhelp material have been shown to help14, Level I. Brief advice (3-5 minutes) is effective
and there is a dose response in treatment provision.
Setting a quit date has been shown to be effective. Ideally the quit date should be
within 2 weeks on assessment to quit.
‚Ä¢
Individual, group and telephone counselling approaches are effective and
should be used in smoking cessation interventions. Smoking cessation
interventions that are delivered in multiple approaches increase abstinence
rates and should be encouraged. Studies have shown that individual
counselling resulted in higher abstinence rates as compared to group or
phone counselling and self-help27, Level II-1; 22, Level I. There are two forms of
telephone counselling which is the ‚Äòproactive counselling‚Äô and ‚Äòreactive
counselling. In proactive counselling, smokers receive calls from healthcare
providers according to a pre-agreed schedule. In ‚Äòreactive counselling‚Äô,
smokers calls a helpline seeking help or advice. Proactive services,
compared to reactive services, have been more widely evaluated as they can
be more easily controlled. Studies have recommended that proactive
telephone counselling as one of the formats for delivering behavioural
counselling20, Level I; 28, Level I; 29, Level I. For hospitalised patients, a study has
shown that high intensive telephone follow-up (4 calls at 48 hours post
discharge, 7, 21, 90 days) was more effective than low intensive follow-up (1
call at 48 hours post discharge) in addition to 30 minutes counselling30, Level I.
Step 5: Arrange follow up
Health care providers wanting to do more intensive counselling will require further
appropriate training. Health care providers who are not confident in providing
counselling interventions can still assist patients wanting to quit by arranging
referrals to services that can assist.
Patients who are attempting to quit are at high risk of relapsing. Continuous
abstinence is achieved when the patient has not smoked for at least 6 months. The
highest risk of relapse is within the first 8 days of quitting. Hence the support has to
be given the utmost importance in the first week of quitting cigarette smoking.
Evidence has shown that abstinence of 12 months follow up is a good indicator for
long term abstinence31.
The evidence suggests that multiple treatment sessions increase smoking
abstinence rate and its effectiveness. More intensive interventions (more than eight
sessions in six months) may produce enhanced abstinence rate. However, these
interventions may have limited reach (affect fewer smokers) and may not be feasible
in some primary care settings20, Level I.
The steps recommended by the NCSCT for evidence-based behaviour change
techniques to assist health care providers in managing smokers who seek clinic
help to quit smoking are32, Level I:-
Session 1: Pre-quit Assessment (1 or 2 weeks prior to Quit Date)
Session 2: Quit Date
Session 3: 1 week post Quit Date
Session 4: 2 weeks post Quit Date
Session 5: 3 weeks post Quit Date
Session 6: 4 weeks post Quit Date
(See Appendix 4 for details)
Table 2: The ‚Äú5 A‚Äôs‚Äù for brief intervention
1.
Ask about tobacco use:
‚Ä¢ Identify and document tobacco use status for every patient at every visit,
including the adolescents.
‚Ä¢ Where appropriate, ask the caretaker of the patient about tobacco use or
exposure to tobacco smoke.
What needs to be done?
Expand the vital signs to include tobacco use or use an alternative universal
identification system (e.g. stickers on patient charts).
2.
Advise to quit:
In a clear, strong and personalized manner urge every tobacco user to quit.
Advice should be:
‚Ä¢ Clear‚Äî"I think it is important for you to quit smoking now and I can help
you." "Cutting down while you are ill is not enough."
‚Ä¢ Strong‚Äî"As your clinician, I need you to know that quitting smoking is the
most important thing you can do to protect your health now and in the
future. The clinic staff and I will help you."
‚Ä¢
Personalised ‚ÄîTie tobacco use to current health/illness, and/or its social
and economic costs, motivation level/readiness to quit, and/or the impact
of tobacco use on children and others in the household.
3.
Assess willingness to make a quit attempt:
Is the tobacco user willing to make a quit attempt at this time?
‚Ä¢ If the patient is willing to make a quit attempt at this time, provide
assistance.
‚Ä¢ If the patient will participate in an intensive treatment, deliver such a
treatment or refer to an intensive intervention.
‚Ä¢ If the patient clearly states he or she is unwilling to make a quit attempt at
this time, provide a motivational intervention built around the ‚Äú5 R‚Äôs‚Äù:
relevance, risks, rewards, roadblocks, and repetition. (Refer to section
Smokers unwilling to quit, page 32)
If the patient is a member of a special population (e.g., adolescent, pregnant
smoker), consider providing additional information (refer to section Special
Population, page 39).
4.
Assist in quit attempt:
‚Ä¢ For the patient willing to make a quit attempt, use counselling with
pharmacotherapy (when indicated) to help him or her quit.
Preparations for quitting: (STAR)
‚Ä¢ Set a quit date. Ideally, the quit date should be within 2 weeks. Reduce
the number of cigarettes gradually before the set date.
‚Ä¢ Tell family, friends, and co-workers about quitting and request
understanding and support. Also, help patient obtain extra-treatment
social support from self-help groups. Other smokers in the household.
Patients should encourage household members to quit with them or not
smoke in their presence to minimize risk of treatment failure and exposure
to second-hand smoking.
‚Ä¢ Anticipate challenges to planned quit attempt, particularly during the
critical first few weeks. These include nicotine withdrawal symptoms.
Discuss challenges/triggers and how patient will successfully overcome
them. Provide patients with problem solving/skills training.
‚Ä¢ Remove tobacco products from his or her environment. Prior to quitting,
avoid smoking in places where a lot of patient‚Äôs time is spent (e.g., work,
home, car).
‚Ä¢ Provide a supportive healthcare environment while encouraging the
patient in his or her quit attempt.
‚Ä¢ Abstinence. Total abstinence is essential. Not even a single puff after the
quit date.
‚Ä¢ Past quit experience. Identify what helped and what hurt in previous quit
attempts.
‚Ä¢ Alcohol. Since alcohol can cause relapse, the patient should consider
limiting/abstaining from alcohol while quitting.
‚Ä¢ Recommend the use of approved pharmacotherapies, if indicated.
Explain how these medications increase smoking cessation success and
reduce withdrawal symptoms.
‚Ä¢ Provide supplementary materials.
5.
Arrange follow-up:
Schedule follow-up, preferably within the first week after the quit date.
‚Ä¢ Timing. Follow-up should occur soon after the quit date, preferably
during the first week. Subsequent follow-ups are recommended weekly
within the first month, and then every two weeks for the 2nd and 3rd
month, and monthly after that up to 6 months.
‚Ä¢ For those who successfully quit, schedule follow-up, either in person or
via telephone. Actions during follow-up:
o Congratulate success
o If tobacco use has occurred, review circumstances and elicit
commitment to total abstinence.
o Remind patient that a lapse can be used as a learning
experience. Identify problems already encountered and
anticipate challenges in the immediate future.
o Assess pharmacotherapy use and problems. Consider using
more intensive treatment, if not available, referral is indicated.

4.1.2 ABC for Smoking Cessation
Alternatively, another approach is the ABC approach to help smokers to quit
smoking (see Appendix 5).
The steps are as follows:
A. Ask all people about their smoking status and document this.
B. Provide Brief advice to stop smoking to all people who smoke, regardless
of their desire or motivation to quit.
C. Make an offer of, and refer to or provide, evidence based Cessation
treatment.
(Implementing the ABC Approach for Smoking Cessation Framework and work
programme, 19)
Physicians may be more effective in promoting attempts to stop smoking by offering
assistance to all smokers than by advising smokers to quit and offering assistance
only to those who express an interest in doing so6.
4.2
Intensive Clinical Interventions for Tobacco Use Disorders
Evidence shows that intensive tobacco dependence treatment is more effective
than brief treatment. This could be achieved by increasing the length of
individual treatment sessions, the number of treatment sessions and specialized
behavioural therapies. Intensive clinical interventions could be provided by any
suitably trained doctors and other health care providers who have the resources
available to give intensive interventions and are appropriate for any tobacco user
willing to participate in them20, Level I.
Table 3: Components of an intensive tobacco dependence intervention
Assessment
‚Ä¢ Assessments should determine whether tobacco
users are willing to make a quit attempt using an
intensive treatment programme.
‚Ä¢ Other assessments can provide information useful in
counselling (e.g., stress level, dependence).
Programme
clinicians
‚Ä¢ Multiple types of clinicians are effective and should be
used.
‚Ä¢ One counselling strategy would be to have a
medical/health care clinician deliver a strong
message to quit and information about health risks
and benefits, and recommend and prescribe
medications recommended in this Guideline update.
‚Ä¢ Nonmedical clinicians could then deliver additional
counselling interventions.
Programme
intensity
There is evidence of a strong dose-response relation;
therefore, when possible, the intensity of the programme
should be:
‚Ä¢ Session length ‚Äì longer than 10 minutes
‚Ä¢ Number of sessions ‚Äì 4 or more
Programme format
‚Ä¢ Either individual or group counselling may be used.
‚Ä¢ Telephone counselling also is effective and can
supplement treatments provided in the clinical setting.
‚Ä¢ Use of self-help materials and cessation Web sites is
optional.
‚Ä¢ Follow up interventions should be scheduled.
Type of
counselling and
behavioural
therapies
Counselling
should
include
practical
counselling
(problem solving/skills training) and intra-treatment social
support.
Medication
‚Ä¢ Every smoker should be offered medications
endorsed
in
this
Guideline,
except
when
contraindicated or for specific populations for which
there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness (i.e.,
pregnant women, smokeless tobacco users, light
smokers, and adolescents).
‚Ä¢ The clinician should explain how medications
increase smoking cessation success and reduce
withdrawal symptoms.
‚Ä¢ Certain combinations of cessation medications also
are effective.
‚Ä¢ Combining counselling and medication increases
abstinence rates.
Population
Intensive intervention programmes may be used with all
tobacco users willing to participate in such efforts.
Adapted from Fiore et al. 2008 (Level I).
4.3
Pharmacological Intervention
All smokers attempting to quit should be offered pharmacotherapy unless
contraindicated21, Level I.
Agents recommended for pharmacotherapy are divided into:
1. Nicotine based ‚Äì e.g. nicotine replacement therapies (NRT), e.g., gum, patch,
lozenge and inhaler
2. Non-nicotine based ‚Äì e.g. varenicline, sustained release (SR) bupropion, and
nortriptyline.
Choice of a specific first-line pharmacotherapy should be guided by four main
factors; efficacy, safety, suitability and cost.
NRT helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by
replacing the nicotine from cigarettes. NRT is available as skin patches that deliver
nicotine slowly, and chewing gum, inhalers/inhalators, oral mouth sprays,
microtabs, nasal sprays and lozenges, all of which deliver nicotine to the brain more
quickly than from skin patches, but less rapidly than from smoking cigarettes.
Evidence shows that all forms of NRT made it more likely that a person's quit
attempt to succeed. The chances of stopping smoking were increased by 50 to 70%.
The evidence suggests no overall difference in effectiveness between different
forms of NRT33, Level I.
NRT products work with or without additional counselling. NRT products do not
need a doctor‚Äôs prescription as they are Group C medications under the Poisons
Act 1952. Heavier smokers usually need higher doses of NRT. People who use
NRT during a quit attempt are likely to further increase their chances of success by
using a combination of two NRT products. Nicotine patch with short-acting nicotinereplacement therapy (e.g., NRT gum) appears safe and increases abstinence
versus nicotine-replacement monotherapy (OR=1.63, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.03) 34, Level I.
Data suggest that starting to use NRT patches shortly before the planned quit date
may increase the chance of success22, Level I.
Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin
irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and lozenge.
There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.
Varenicline, a specific nicotine receptor partial agonist, may help people stop
smoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract
withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction
(acting as an antagonist). The odds of quitting were between two and three times
higher with varenicline than that with placebo. Varenicline was about 50% more
effective than any single formulation of NRT (patches, gum, lozenges, and inhalers),
but similar in efficacy to combining two types of NRT33, Level I.
The pooled RR from high-quality evidence for continuous or sustained abstinence
at six months or longer for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.24
(95% CI 2.06 to 2.43). Varenicline at lower or variable doses was also shown to be
effective, with an RR of 2.08 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78). The RR for varenicline versus
NRT for abstinence at 24 weeks was 1.25 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.37). The pooled RR
for varenicline versus bupropion at six months was 1.39 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.54) 35,
Level I.
Trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen
found the drug to be well-tolerated during long-term use. The number needed to
treat with varenicline for an additional beneficial outcome, based on the weighted
mean control rate, is 11 (95% CI 9 to 13)35, Level I.
The most commonly reported adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was
mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Serious adverse
events (SAE) such as neuropsychiatric occurring during or after active treatment
suggests there may be a 25% increase in the chance of SAEs among people using
varenicline (RR=1.25; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.49)35, Level I.
‚Ä¢ NRT provides some of the nicotine that a person would have otherwise
received from tobacco, and in doing so reduces the person‚Äôs urge to smoke.
‚Ä¢ All NRT products roughly double a person‚Äôs chance of stopping compared with
a placebo.
‚Ä¢ People should use NRT for at least eight to twelve weeks.
‚Ä¢ Using two NRT products (for example, patches and gum) is more effective than
using one.
‚Ä¢ People who need NRT for longer than 12 weeks can continue to use it.
‚Ä¢ If the person is not ready to stop smoking straight away, NRT can be used to
help reduce their smoking before they stop.
‚Ä¢ There are four different NRT products available in Malaysia, including the
patch, gum, lozenges and inhalator.
However, subsequent observational cohort studies and meta-analyses have not
confirmed these fears. The findings of the largest trial to date on varenicline and
bupropion in comparison with NRT and placebo in subjects with and without
psychiatric disorders do not support a causal link between varenicline and
neuropsychiatric disorders, including suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour.
36,(Anthenelli et al. 2016 Level I). Concerns have also been raised that varenicline may
slightly increase cardiovascular events in people already at increased risk of those
illnesses. Current evidence neither supports nor refutes such an association35, Level
I.
The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline also aid long-term smoking
cessation. The odds of quitting were about 80% higher with bupropion than with
placebo. Evidence suggests that the mode of action of bupropion and nortriptyline
is independent of their antidepressant effect and that they are of similar efficacy to
nicotine replacement. Evidence also suggests that bupropion is less effective than
varenicline, but further research is needed to confirm this finding37, Level I).
Nortriptyline was more effective than placebo, but did not offer any additional
improvement when combined with NRT. Evidence suggests that neither selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) nor monoamine oxidase inhibitors aid
cessation37, Level I.
‚Ä¢ Varenicline reduces a person‚Äôs urge to smoke, as well as the ‚Äòreward‚Äô they get
from smoking, and at least doubles a person‚Äôs chance of stopping smoking.
‚Ä¢ Before prescribing or recommending varenicline, check the contraindications
and cautions that apply.
‚Ä¢ Pregnant or breastfeeding women and people under the age of 18 cannot use
varenicline.
‚Ä¢ Patients should use it for 12 weeks.
‚Ä¢ Common adverse effects include nausea, abnormal dreams and sleep
disturbance. More serious adverse events ‚Äì such as cardiovascular events,
depression, suicidal ideation and suicide ‚Äì have been reported, although these
are uncommon.
‚Ä¢ If someone using varenicline experiences changes in mood or behaviour,
advise them to stop taking varenicline and contact a health care provider
immediately.
The side effects of bupropion include insomnia, dry mouth and nausea and rarely
(1:1000) seizures and perhaps psychiatric problems, but the last is unclear. There
is also moderate quality evidence, limited by a relatively small number of included
studies and participants, that the antidepressant nortriptyline increases quit rates
(six trials, 975 participants). The side effects of nortriptyline include dry mouth,
constipation, nausea, and sedation, and it can be dangerous in overdose37, Level I.
There are no fixed algorithms to guide optimal selection among these first-line
medications. Cost may become the predominant factor when the smoker is paying
out-of-pocket, as in buying the medication from a community pharmacist or private
quit smoking cessation service. Suitability factors (e.g. nature of job, preference,
etc.) should be considered to fit the medication to the lifestyle of the smoker. For
instance, the NRT patch is the most discreet among the NRT products since it can
be worn under the clothing. Conversely, some smokers prefer an oral form of the
NRT products (e.g., gum, lozenge or inhaler) since it addresses the hand and/or
mouth fixation, to a certain extent, associated with smoking. Others prefer the
simplicity of taking a tablet, as in the case of varenicline or bupropion.
‚Ä¢ Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that reduces the severity of tobacco
withdrawal and approximately doubles a person‚Äôs chance of stopping
smoking.
‚Ä¢ People should start bupropion at least one week before their quit date and use
it for at least seven weeks.
‚Ä¢ Before prescribing or recommending bupropion, check the contraindications
and cautions that apply.
‚Ä¢ Pregnant or breastfeeding women and people under the age of 18 cannot use
bupropion.
‚Ä¢ Common adverse effects include dry mouth, insomnia and headache. Seizure
has been rarely reported and depression has been reported in some people.
Healthcare providers should discuss the pertinent details of the available
medications with each smoker (Tables 1 to 6). Some smokers may prefer to sample
a few preparations before finding the one most suitable for them. NRT preferences
based on explanations has been shown to change after sampling. NRT sampling
may also lead to better choice and treatment compliance38, Level II-2).
Prior successful experience (sustained abstinence with the medication) suggests
that the medication may be helpful to the patient in a subsequent quit attempt,
especially if the patient finds the medication to be tolerable and/or easy to use.
However, some evidence suggest that re-treating relapsed smokers with the same
medication produces small or no benefit, while other evidences suggest that it may
be of substantial benefit20, Level I.
The recommended duration of treatment is 12 weeks. The use of NRT for less than
4 weeks was associated with reduced likelihood of cessation. NRT use for longer
periods of time has been associated with a higher likelihood of cessation However,
data suggest no overall benefit for using patches beyond eight weeks39, Level II-2.
Dosing of each medication is detailed in Appendix 6.
Recommendation 2
Grade of
Recommendation
All smokers who are attempting to quit should be offered
pharmacotherapy, unless contraindicated.
A
‚Ä¢ Nortriptyline is an antidepressant medicine that also helps people stop
smoking.
‚Ä¢ Nortriptyline reduces the severity of tobacco withdrawal symptoms and
roughly doubles a person‚Äôs chance of stopping smoking long term.
‚Ä¢ People should start nortriptyline at least one week before their quit date and
use it for 12 weeks. The dose should be tapered at the end of treatment to
avoid withdrawal symptoms that may occur.
‚Ä¢ Before prescribing or recommending nortriptyline, check the contraindications
and cautions that apply.
‚Ä¢ Pregnant or breastfeeding women and people under the age of 18 cannot use
nortriptyline.
‚Ä¢ Common adverse effects include drowsiness and dry mouth.
4.3.1 Combination of pharmacological agents
Monotherapy of NRT provides lower level of plasma nicotine as compared to that
produced by cigarette smoking (Fig 1.) While monotherapy has been shown to be
effective in majority of smokers, others, especially those who are hard-to-treat, may
require combination strategy.
Figure 1. Plasma nicotine concentration for various nicotine containing products.
Data from Fant et al. 199940; Choi et al. 2003; Schneider et al. 200141. (From Rx for
Change: Clinician-Assisted Tobacco Cessation. The Regents of the University of
California, University of Southern California and Western University of Health
Sciences ¬© 1999-2005: with permission)
Certain combinations of first-line medications have been shown to be effective
smoking cessation treatment. Therefore, clinicians should consider using these
combinations of medications in their patients who are willing to quit. Effective
combination medications are20, Level I:
(1)
Long-term (>14 weeks) nicotine patch + other NRT (gum and spray)
(2)
Nicotine patch + nicotine inhaler
(3)
Nicotine patch + bupropion SR
Strategies of combining agents available (e.g., two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g.
bupropion with a NRT) may be more efficacious. For example, combining the
nicotine patch with a self - administered form of nicotine replacement therapy (either
the nicotine gum or nicotine inhaler) is more efficacious than a single form of
nicotine replacement, and patients should be encouraged to use such combined
treatments if they are unable to quit using a single type of first-line
pharmacotherapy42 Level I; 43; 44.
Current literature indicates that combination therapy is statistically better than
monotherapy in smoking cessation treatment. Adverse effects and adherence to
combination therapy are similar to monotherapy and placebo45.
Combination therapy may be most useful for those smokers at highest risk of
relapse, e.g. heavy smokers, smokers who have relapsed multiple times, or
smokers with psychiatric co-morbidities. However, cost is an important
consideration 46.
Combining varenicline with NRT agents has been associated with higher rates of
side effects (eg nausea, headache)20, Level I.
4.3.2 Other pharmacological agents
a)
Cytisine
Cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although absolute quit rates were
modest. Two trials of low-quality evidence involving cytisine found that more
participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at longest
follow-up, with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 3.98 (95%CI 2.01 to 7.87). One more
recent trial comparing cytisine with NRT in 1310 people found a benefit for cytisine
at six months (RR=1.43, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80)35, Level I.
b)
Anti Nicotine Vaccines
The rationale for immunization against nicotine is to induce antibodies that bind
nicotine in the blood, thereby preventing it from crossing the blood brain barrier. It
is postulated that with less nicotine reaching the brain immediately after smoking,
the vicious cycle between smoking and nicotine related gratification will be broken.
(RACGP 2011). There are no nicotine vaccines currently licensed for public use,
but there are a few in development. Studies have not shown that vaccines help
people to stop smoking in the long term. Trials showed nicotine vaccines to be
generally safe, with most side effects being mild or moderate, including flu-like
symptoms. There were no trials testing whether nicotine vaccines helped keep
people who had stopped smoking from starting to smoke again47, Level I.
4.3.3 Combination of pharmacological agents with behavioural intervention
There is high quality evidence that using a combination of behavioural support and
medication increases the chances of successfully quitting after at least six months.
Combined results of these studies suggest that the chance of success is increased
by 70 to 100 percent compared to just brief advice or support. There was some
evidence that the effect tended to be larger when participants were recruited in
healthcare settings. There was no clear evidence that providing more contact
increased the number of people who quit smoking at six months or longer48, Level I.
4.4
Other Treatments and Interventions
There are many other treatments and interventions that people may ask about or
want to use, such as hypnosis and acupuncture. However, there is evidence that
some of these interventions do not help people to stop smoking, and for other
interventions, there is insufficient evidence as to their effectiveness.
4.4.1 Hypnosis
There is evidence that hypnosis does not improve long-term abstinence rates over
any intervention providing the same amount of time and attention to the
participant49, Level I.
4.4.2 Acupuncture
Acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy and electrostimulation do not improve
long-term abstinence rates over that of a placebo effect50, Level I.
Although pooled estimates suggest possible short-term effects there is no
consistent, bias-free evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, or laser therapy have
a sustained benefit on smoking cessation for six months or more. However, no firm
conclusions can be drawn due lack of evidence and methodological flaws. Welldesigned research into acupuncture, acupressure and laser stimulation is justified
since these are popular interventions and safe when correctly applied, though these
interventions alone are likely to be less effective than evidence-based interventions
51, Level I.
‚Ä¢ Hypnosis, acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy and electrostimulation
do not improve the long term abstinence rate in smoking cessation
4.4.3 Quitlines
Quitlines are defined as telephone counselling in which at least some of the contacts
are initiated by the quitline counsellor to deliver tobacco use interventions, including
call-back counselling. Adding Quitline counselling to pharmacotherapy and minimal
intervention increases abstinence rates (RR=1.29; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.38)52, Level I .
These analyses suggest a robust effect of quitline counselling and are consistent
with the guideline released by Centres for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs: Guide
to Community Preventive Services (CDC 2004).
4.4.4 Electronic cigarette / Vape
Electronic cigarette (EC) use is a very hot topic that has generated considerable
global debate. ECs are electronic devices that heat a liquid into an aerosol for
inhalation. The liquid usually comprises propylene glycol and glycerol, nicotine and
flavours, and stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir. In Malaysia,
the term vape is used instead of EC when the liquid used is without nicotine. Since
ECs appeared on the market in 2006 smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of
smoking and for quitting, but some healthcare organizations, tobacco control
advocacy groups and policy makers have been reluctant to encourage smokers to
switch to ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Furthermore, there are
concerns of health hazards from the usage of electronic cigarette / vape; from
nicotine poisoning, hazards of flavourings, risk of exposure to carcinogens, as well
as threat to de-normalisation of smoking (WHO 2014).
Results from two earlier studies found that participants using an EC were more likely
to have abstained from smoking for at least 6 months compared with participants
using placebo EC (RR=2.29; 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo 4% versus EC 9%). The
one study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant difference in sixmonth abstinence rates (RR=1.26; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.34). However, it was noted that
these 2 studies were rated low and very low, respectively, based on GRADE
standards53, Level I.
Despite having the potential to decrease cigarette consumption, ECs role in
smoking cessation remains unclear (Citation 2016) . A meta-analysis by
Kalkhoran & Glantz (2016) showed that smokers who use ECs are 28% (OR=0¬∑72;
95% CI 0¬∑57 to 0¬∑91) less likely to quit smoking compared to those who did not use
them54, Level I.
None of the included studies (short- to mid-term, up to two years) detected serious
adverse events considered possibly related to EC use. The most commonly
reported adverse effects were irritation of the mouth and throat. The long-term
safety of ECs is still unknown53, Level I.
4.4.5 Online smoking cessation interventions
Two studies have found that text message mobile phone support programmes are
effective in the short term (6 weeks) and long term55, Level I; 56, Level I. Combined
internet/ mobile telephone programmes can be effective for up to 12 months for
assisting smokers to quit57, Level I; 58, Level I.
Online smoking cessation interventions are low cost and have the potential to reach
a large number of smokers59, Level I; 60, Level I. Web based programmes are a promising
delivery system for assisting smokers to quit, but further research is needed to
identify their most effective use.
4.4.6 Aversive smoking for smoking cessation
The existing studies provide insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of rapid
smoking, or whether there is a dose-response to aversive stimulation. Milder
versions of aversive smoking seem to lack specific efficacy. Rapid smoking is an
unproven method with sufficient indications of promise to warrant evaluation using
modern rigorous methodology61, Level I.
5.0
FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE UNWILLING TO QUIT
Motivational interviewing (MI) techniques may assist with smoking cessation when
the health care providers are empathetic, promotes patient autonomy (e.g., choice
among options), avoids arguments, and supports the patient‚Äôs self-efficacy (e.g., by
identifying previous successes in behaviour change efforts)62, Level III; 63 , Level I. Table
10 highlights the strategies that can be used in motivational interviewing technique.
Patients unwilling to make a quit attempt during a visit may be due to:
‚Ä¢ Lack of information about the harmful effects of tobacco,
‚Ä¢ May be demoralized because of previous relapse.
‚Ä¢ Lack the required financial resources
‚Ä¢ May have fears or concerns about quitting
Such patients may respond to a motivational intervention built around the
‚Äú5R‚Äôs‚Äù: Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblocks and Repetition (Table 5).
Table 4: Strategy B1. Motivational interviewing strategies
Express
empathy
‚Ä¢ Use open-ended questions to explore:
o The importance of addressing smoking or other
tobacco use (e.g., ‚ÄúHow important do you think it is
for you to quit smoking?‚Äù)
o Concerns and benefits of quitting (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat might
happen if you quit?‚Äù)
‚Ä¢
Use reflective listening to seek shared understanding:
o Reflect words or meaning (e.g., ‚ÄúSo you think
smoking helps you to maintain your weight.‚Äù).
o Summarize (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat I have heard so far is that
smoking is something you enjoy. On the other hand,
your boyfriend hates your smoking, and you are
worried you might develop a serious disease.‚Äù).
‚Ä¢
Normalize feelings and concerns (e.g., ‚ÄúMany people worry
about managing without cigarettes.‚Äù).
‚Ä¢
Support the patient‚Äôs autonomy and right to choose or reject
change (e.g., ‚ÄúI hear you saying you are not ready to quit
smoking right now. I‚Äôm here to help you when you are
ready.‚Äù).
Develop
discrepancy
‚Ä¢ Highlight the discrepancy between the patient‚Äôs present
behaviour and expressed priorities, values, and goals (e.g.,
‚ÄúIt sounds like you are very devoted to your family. How do
you think your smoking is affecting your children?‚Äù).
‚Ä¢ Reinforce and support ‚Äúchange talk‚Äù and ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù
language:
o ‚ÄúSo, you realize how smoking is affecting your breathing
and making it hard to keep up with your kids.‚Äù
o ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great that you are going to quit when you get through
this busy time at work.‚Äù
‚Ä¢
Build and deepen commitment to change:
o ‚ÄúThere are effective treatments that will ease the pain of
quitting, including counselling and many medication
options.‚Äù
o ‚ÄúWe would like to help you avoid a stroke like the one
your father had.‚Äù
Roll with
resistance
‚Ä¢ Back off and use reflection when the patient expresses
resistance:
o ‚ÄúSounds like you are feeling pressured about your
smoking.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Express empathy:
o ‚ÄúYou are worried about how you would manage
withdrawal symptoms.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Ask permission to provide information:
o ‚ÄúWould you like to hear about some strategies that can
help you address that concern when you quit?‚Äù
Support
self-efficacy
‚Ä¢ Help the patient to identify and build on past successes:
o ‚ÄúSo you were fairly successful the last time you tried to
quit.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Offer options for achievable small steps toward change:
o Read about quitting benefits and strategies.
o Change smoking patterns (e.g., no smoking in the
home).
o Ask the patient to share his or her ideas about quitting
strategies.

Table 5: Enhancing motivation to quit tobacco‚Äîthe ‚Äú5 R‚Äôs‚Äù
Relevance ‚Ä¢ Encourage the patient to indicate why quitting is personally
relevant, being as specific as possible.
‚Ä¢ Motivational information has the greatest impact if it is relevant to
a patient‚Äôs disease status or risk, family or social situation (e.g.
having children in the home), health concerns, age, gender, and
other important patient characteristics (e.g. prior quitting
experience, personal barriers to cessation).
Risks
The clinician should ask the patient to identify potential negative
consequences of tobacco use. The clinician may suggest and
highlight those that seem most relevant to the patient. The clinician
should emphasize that smoking low-tar/low-nicotine cigarettes or use
of other forms of tobacco (e.g., smokeless tobacco, cigars, and pipes)
will not eliminate these risks. Examples of risks are:
Acute risks: Shortness of breath, exacerbation of asthma, increased
risk of respiratory infections, harm to pregnancy, impotence, and
infertility.
Long-term risks: Heart attacks and strokes, lung and other cancers
(e.g., larynx, oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, pancreas, stomach,
kidney, bladder, cervix, and acute myelocytic leukemia), chronic
obstructive pulmonary diseases (chronic bronchitis and emphysema),
osteoporosis, long-term disability, and need for extended care.
Environmental risks: Increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease
in spouses; increased risk for low birth-weight, sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS), asthma, middle ear disease, and respiratory
infections in children of smokers.
Rewards
The clinician should ask the patient to identify potential benefits of
stopping tobacco use. The clinician may suggest and highlight those
that seem most relevant to the patient. Examples of rewards follow:
‚Ä¢ Improved health
‚Ä¢ Food will taste better
‚Ä¢ Improved sense of smell
‚Ä¢ Saving money
‚Ä¢ Feeling better about oneself
‚Ä¢ Home, car, clothing, breath will smell better
‚Ä¢ Setting a good example for children and decreasing the likelihood
that they will smoke
‚Ä¢ Having healthier babies and children
‚Ä¢ Feeling better physically
‚Ä¢ Performing better in physical activities
‚Ä¢ Improved appearance, including reduced wrinkling/aging of skin
and whiter teeth
Roadblocks
The clinician should ask the patient to identify barriers or impediments
to quitting and provide treatment (problem solving counselling,
medication) that could address barriers. Typical barriers might include:
‚Ä¢ Withdrawal symptoms
‚Ä¢ Fear of failure
‚Ä¢ Weight gain
‚Ä¢ Lack of support
‚Ä¢ Depression
‚Ä¢ Enjoyment of tobacco
‚Ä¢ Being around other tobacco users
‚Ä¢ Limited knowledge of effective treatment options
Repetition The motivational intervention should be repeated every time an
unmotivated patient visits the clinic setting. Tobacco users who have
failed in previous quit attempts should be told that most people make
repeated quit attempts before they are successful.

PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECENTLY QUIT (RELAPSE PREVENTION)
For smokers who have recently quit, relapse prevention intervention may focus on
identifying and resolving tempting situations or smoking cues64, Level I. Most
interventions have tried a skills-based approach, where recent quitters are taught
to recognise high-risk situations and acquire the skills to withstand the temptation
to smoke. However, trained health care providers should provide targeted and
effective relapse prevention interventions due to the chronic relapsing nature of
tobacco dependence 65, Level III; 66, Level III; 67,Level III).
When clinicians encounter a patient who has quit tobacco use recently, they should:
a. Reinforce the patient‚Äôs decision to quit
b. Review with patient the benefits of quitting
c. Assist the patient in resolving any residual problems arising from quitting.
Almost all lapses occur during the first 3 months after treatment and half of those
who have their first lapse smoke their second cigarette within 24 hours of the first
cigarette or immediately following treatment68, Level I. The annual incidence of relapse
was around 20% to 25%69, Level I.
Relapse prevention interventions can be delivered by means of scheduled clinic
visits, telephone calls, use of quitline or any time the clinician encounters an extobacco user. There are two practices of relapse prevention, either minimal or
intensive.
6.1
Minimal Practice Relapse Prevention
This is appropriate for most recent quitters and can be addressed briefly during a
coincident clinic visit or a scheduled follow-up visit. Similarly, the ‚Äú5 R‚Äôs‚Äù strategy
should be used to prevent relapse. Patients should be encouraged to report
difficulties promptly (e.g. lapses, depression, medication side-effects) while
continuing efforts to remain abstinent. The simple D.E.A.D. pointer technique can
be applied to refrain oneself from smoking:
Delay ‚Äì Deliberately delay the act of lighting up cigarette by doing something else
Escape ‚Äì Escape any situation / environment that induce smoking
Avoid ‚Äì Plan to avoid situation / environment that induce smoking
Distract ‚Äì Distract the intention to smoke by doing relaxation techniques,
housework, spending time with family, etc.
Strategy: Intervening with the patient who has recently quit
Former tobacco user should be congratulated on ANY success and strong
encouragement to remain abstinent.
When encountering a recent quitter, use open-ended questions relevant to
the topics below to discover if the patient wishes to discuss issues related
to quitting (e.g., How has stopping tobacco use helped you?):
‚Ä¢ The benefits, including potential health benefits, the patient may derive from
cessation
‚Ä¢ Any success the patient has had in quitting (duration of abstinence, reduction
in withdrawal, etc.)
‚Ä¢ The problems encountered or anticipated threats to maintaining abstinence
(e.g. depression, weight gain, alcohol, other tobacco users in the household,
significant stressors)
‚Ä¢ A medication check-in, including effectiveness and side effects if the patient is
still taking medication
Adapted from Fiore et al. 200820, Level I.
6.2
Intensive Practice Relapse Prevention
Intensive relapse prevention components are individualized based on information
obtained on what causes relapse and problems encountered by patients in
maintaining abstinence. This intervention has place important in behaviour
modification through imparting skills in counselling and monitoring70, Level III). These
interventions may be delivered during a dedicated follow-up contact (in-person or
by telephone) or through a specialized clinic or programme. Specific interventions
recommended for problems related to maintaining smoking cessation are listed in
the strategy table below. Long-term smoking cessation pharmacotherapy should be
considered as a strategy to reduce the likelihood of relapse.
Strategy: Addressing problems encountered by former smokers
A patient who previously smoked might identify a problem that negatively affects
health or quality of life. Specific problems likely to be reported by former smokers
and potential responses follow:
Problems
Responses
Lack of support
for cessation
‚Ä¢ Schedule follow-up visits or telephone calls with the
patient.
‚Ä¢ Help the patient identify sources of support within his or
her environment.
‚Ä¢ Refer the patient to an appropriate organization that offers
counselling or support.
Negative mood
or depression
‚Ä¢ If significant, provide counselling, prescribe appropriate
medication, or refer the patient to a specialist.
Strong or
prolonged
withdrawal
symptoms
‚Ä¢ If the patient reports prolonged craving or other
withdrawal symptoms, consider extending the use of an
approved medication or adding/combining medications to
reduce strong withdrawal symptoms.
Weight gain
‚Ä¢ Recommend starting or increasing physical activity.
‚Ä¢ Reassure the patient that some weight gain after quitting
is common and usually is self-limiting.
‚Ä¢ Emphasize the health benefits of quitting relative to the
health risks of modest weight gain.
‚Ä¢ Emphasize the importance of a healthy diet and active
lifestyle.
‚Ä¢ Suggest low-calorie substitutes such as sugarless
chewing gum, vegetables, or mints.
‚Ä¢ Refer the patient to a nutritional counsellor or programme.
Smoking lapses
‚Ä¢ Suggest continued use of medications, which can reduce
the likelihood that a lapse will lead to a full relapse.
‚Ä¢ Encourage another quit attempt or a commitment to total
abstinence.
‚Ä¢ Reassure that quitting may take multiple attempts, and
use the lapse as a learning experience.
‚Ä¢ Provide or refer for intensive counselling.

SPECIAL POPULATIONS
7.1
Female Smokers
Smoking cessation clinical trials reveal that the same treatments benefit both men
and women71, Level II-2; 72, Level II-2. However, research suggests that some treatments
are less efficacious in women than in men (e.g., NRTs) 73, Level I due to lack of
documented data on smoking status among women and lack of intervention74, Level I
as well as different brain system modulated by noradrenergic activity in women75,
Level II-2. Women found to be less likely to stop76, Level II-3, may have more difficulty to
quit smoking77, Level I and less likely to be abstinent compared to men78, Level I.
Although research shows that women benefit from the same interventions as men,
women may face different stressors and barriers to quitting that should be
addressed in treatment. These stressors and barriers include greater weight control
concerns79, Level II-2, hormonal cycles80, Level II-2 and stress smoking77, 2015 Level I).
Women who are considering pregnancy may be especially receptive to tobacco
cessation.
Other documented evidence which improve female smokers to quit are social
support81, Level I, physical activity82, Level II-2; 83, Level II-3 and customised intervention
programme for women especially pregnant smokers who are coming for antenatal
follow up84, Level I.
7.2
Pregnant and Lactating Women
Smoking in pregnancy imparts risks to both the mother and the foetus. Cigarette
smoking by pregnant women has been shown to cause adverse foetal outcomes,
including stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, decreased foetal growth, premature
births85, Level II-2, low birth-weight, placental abruption, decrease psychomotor
development82, Level II-2 and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); and has been
linked to cognitive, emotional, and behavioural problems in children such as
hyperactivity/inattention86, Level II; 87; Level II-2; 88, Level III.
Many women are motivated to quit during pregnancy, and health care professionals
can take advantage of this motivation by reinforcing the knowledge that cessation
will reduce health risks to the foetus and that there are postpartum benefits for both
the mother and child. Successful quitting will not only benefit a mother‚Äôs long term
health by reducing the risk of disease development89, Level II-2 and there is evidence
that quitting smoking during pregnancy reduces the risk of unfavourable pregnancy
outcomes90, Level I.
Evidence shows psychosocial intervention is effective in supporting pregnant
smokers to quit91, Level I however there is no serious side effect found for NRT use
among pregnant smokers92, Level I and lactating smokers93. Intermittent, short-acting
forms of NRT, such as gum and lozenge are recommended to deliver a lower total
daily nicotine dose. For lactating woman, using intermittent, short-acting forms of
NRT are preferable and the woman should be advised to avoid using the products
for at least one hour before breastfeeding94, Level I.
Effective psychosocial interventions for pregnant patients
Physician advice regarding smoking-related risks (2‚Äì3 minutes); video messages
with information on risks, barriers, and tips for quitting; midwife counselling in one
10-minute session; self-help manual; and follow up letters.
Pregnancy-specific self-help materials (Pregnant Woman‚Äôs Self-Help Guide to Quit
Smoking) and one 10-minute counselling session with a health educator.

7.3
Hospitalised Smokers
Hospitalisation provides a powerful opportunity to quit smoking. It is vital that they
attempt to quit smoking, as smoking may interfere with their recovery. Augmented
smoking cessation treatments e.g. self-help via brochure or audio/videotape, chart,
prompt reminding physician to advise smoking cessation, pharmacotherapy,
hospital counselling, and post-discharge counselling telephone calls have been
shown to be effective. Among cardiac patients, second heart attacks are more
common in those who continue to smoke95. Lung, head, and neck cancer patients
who are successfully treated, but who continue to smoke, are at higher risk for a
second cancer96, Level I; 97, Level II-3; 98, Level I; 99, Level I; 100; 99, Level I. Additionally, smoking
delays bone and wound healing101; 102; 103.
Hospitalised patients may be particularly motivated to make a quit attempt for two
reasons. Firstly, the illness causing the hospitalisation may have been due to or
exacerbated by smoking, highlighting the patient‚Äôs personal vulnerability to the
health risks of smoking104; 105. Secondly, all hospitals in Malaysia are designated
smoke-free areas106. Patients in long-term care facilities such as mental health
institution, old folks home, rehabilitation centres should also receive tobacco
cessation interventions.
Suggested interventions for hospitalised patients are as follows:
a. Ask each patient on admission if he or she uses tobacco and document tobacco
use status.
b. For current tobacco users, record tobacco use status on the admission problem
list and as a discharge diagnosis.
c. Use counselling and pharmacotherapy to assist all tobacco users to maintain
abstinence and to treat withdrawal symptoms accordingly.
d. Provide advice and assistance on how to quit during hospitalisation and remain
abstinent after discharge.
7.4
Psychiatric Patients
Introduction
It is estimated that 11.2% of Malaysians have some form of mental illness107, Level II3). Studies have shown that the prevalence of smoking amongst psychiatric patients
can be as high as two to three times that of the general population108, Level II-3; 109, Level
II-1. Often, these same smokers smoke at higher rates, on average 25 cigarettes per
day110, Level II-1; are highly addicted and it is estimated that they consume 43.9% of
all cigarettes sold in the US111, Level II-2. These same patients have higher health
morbidity and mortality, dying 25 years earlier compared to the persons who do not
smoke112, Level II-2.
Despite these startling numbers, psychiatric patients often do not receive advice or
treatment to quit smoking19, Level II-3. In a study, a total of 105 psychiatric patients who
were identified as current smokers, only 1 patient was encouraged to quit smoking,
referred for cessation treatment, and provided with nicotine replacement therapy on
discharge113, Level II-2.
Studies have shown that psychiatric patients can quit and want to quit 114; 115, Level II3 and those who do quit often receive similar health benefits as those without
psychiatric illness. The American Psychiatry Association (APA) also recommends
that psychiatrists assess the smoking status of all patients, including readiness to
quit, previous quitting history and level of nicotine dependence116, Level II-2. Therefore,
it is important that ALL patients be asked to quit when seen in psychiatric services.
Despite the very good and extensive database on the safety and efficacy of
pharmacological treatment of tobacco dependence, only a few studies have
examined their use in mentally ill patients. Depression and schizophrenia have been
the most studied amongst the various mental illnesses. The combination of
pharmacological and behavioural measure is deemed to be the gold standard in the
treatment of tobacco dependence.
A recent recommendation for all patients with mental illness who smoke from
European Psychiatric Association (EPA)117, Level III, are as follows:
1. Record the smoking status:
Smoking status should be evaluated and documented for every psychiatric patient
and the degree of dependence should be documented (preferentially with the
FTND).
2. Set the time of the intervention
The best time for cessation would be when the patient is in a stable phase, with no
recent or planned changes in medications and no urgent problems take precedence
3. Give counselling
‚Äò5 As Intervention‚Äô is recommended for the short-term intervention by physicians.
To increase the quit rate, established programmes (individual therapy, group
therapy, telephone coaching) should be employed wherever available
4. Offer drug treatment with a first-line product
NRT, varenicline, bupropion should be given for even a mild degree of tobacco
dependence. Attention must be paid on the severity of tobacco dependence,
possible psychiatric side effects, drug-drug interactions and contraindications.
5. Contact within first days after quit day
6. Perform follow-up visits
7. Relapse prevention and management
The patient should be made aware that lapses and relapses are fine and a new
attempt with different procedures (e.g. psychotherapy, medication) should be
discussed with the patient.
7.4.1 Schizophrenia
There are limited smoking cessation pharmacological clinical trials conducted on
persons suffering from schizophrenia. The most investigated smoking cessation
pharmacological treatments are nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), sustained
release bupropion (bupropion SR) and varenicline.
The effectiveness of NRT in this group of patients is unclear owing to the few trials
with small sample size. One trial compared the use of high dose transdermal
nicotine patch (42 mg) with regular dose transdermal nicotine patch (21 mg) in 51
patients with schizophrenia who wanted to quit smoking. In this trial, seven-day
point prevalence abstinence rates at eight weeks were not significantly different
between the high dose group (32%) and the regular dose group (23%)118 , Level II-1.
Bupropion has been found to be effective for smoking cessation in schizophrenia
patients. A meta-analyses119, Level I reported that the cessation rates after using
bupropion was significantly higher than placebo at the end of treatment (seven trials,
N = 340; RR=3.03; 95% CI 1.69 to 5.42) and after six months (five trials, N = 214,
RR=2.78; 95% CI 1.02 to 7.58). At the end of treatment, smokers with schizophrenia
who received bupropion smoked about 11 fewer cigarettes per day than those who
took placebo. There were no significant differences in positive, negative and
depressive symptoms between bupropion and placebo groups. There were no
reports of major adverse events such as seizures with bupropion.
The effectiveness of combination of different smoking cessation treatments is
unclear in treating schizophrenia. Nevertheless, a 10-week, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial of bupropion (300 mg/day) in combination with transdermal nicotine
patch (21 mg/24h) for 58 outpatient smokers with schizophrenia found that the
combination of bupropion and transdermal nicotine patch was well-tolerated and
significantly improved short-term smoking abstinence in this group of patients120,
Level II-2. Another small randomized controlled trial by 121, Level II-1 found that patients
taking bupropion and NRT had a significant increase in smoking reduction at 3 and
6 months (60% vs. 31%; P = 0.036), and a greater continuous abstinence rate at
week 8, (52% vs. 19%; P = 0.014) over patients taking placebo and NRT.
For varenicline, the information that varenicline increased smoking cessation rates
higher than placebo in individuals with schizophrenia was based on two studies.
These studies found that smokers with schizophrenia were nearly 5 times more
likely to quit compared to placebo at the end of the treatment (N = 137; RR=4.74,
95% CI 1.34 to 16.71)119, Level I. This information, however, need to take into
consideration that it was based on only two studies. There is no sufficient direct
evidence presently to know whether the benefit of varenicline is maintained for six
months or more. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in reported
psychiatric symptoms between the varenicline and placebo groups122, Level I.
7.4.2 Depression
Depression is one of the commonest mental health conditions worldwide and is
estimated to be the second leading cause of health morbidity by 2020123, Level II-3.
Smoking and smoking cessation has been linked to both depressed mood and
depression, however, the relationship is unclear.
A recent review by Gierisch (2012)124, Level I looking at smoking cessation
interventions for patients with depression identified only 3 RCT‚Äôs out of the 16
studies reviewed which included patients with current depression. This review found
small, but positive findings for the use of antidepressant (RR=1.31; 95% CI 0.73 to
2.34), NRT and addition of behavioural mood management (RR=1.41; 95% CI 1.01
to 1.96).
The Cochrane group reviewed the use of antidepressants and smoking cessation
and found positive results for both bupropion (44 trials and almost 13,000
participants, RR=1.62, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.76) and nortryptyline (9 trials, 975
participants, RR=2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.79)37, Level I. Both medications increase the
likelihood to quit, however, for bupropion this is seen for at least six weeks. This
review did not find any added advantage of the serotonin selective reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) as a quit smoking agent (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.22).
International guidelines have suggested that individuals with depression and
wanting to quit smoking can be started on these two treatments.
Varenicline has been found to be the most effective agent for smoking cessation
(RR=2.31) and probably equally effective for both individuals with and without
depression. Risk of suicidal behaviour has not been found to be true in the
community37, Level I. However, caution is still recommended as a result of previous
concerns.
Anxiolytics have not been found to be useful for smoking cessation.
7.4.3 Bipolar Disorder
There are only four published controlled smoking cessation treatment studies in
smokers with bipolar disorder using pharmacological agents such as nicotine
replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline.
An open-label, pilot study suggested that NRT (nicotine patch) may be an effective
treatment for tobacco dependence in bipolar smokers125, Level II-3.
One small study on smoking cessation using sustained-release bupropion involved
only five patients. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study,
two smokers in the bupropion group either quit or reduced their smoking compared
to placebo treatment which was associated with early dropout from the study and
occurrence of symptoms of hypomania126, Level I.
In a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, relapseprevention clinical trial conducted in 10 community mental-health centres, 247
smokers with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were enrolled. Two hundred and
three received 12-week treatment with varenicline and cognitive behavioural
therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy alone. After a period of a year, the pointprevalence abstinence rates was 60% with varenicline treatment and 19% with
placebo (OR = 6.2; 95% CI 2.2 to 19.2). Varenicline was also found to be efficacious
for maintenance treatment in the study and furthermore there were no impact on
psychiatric symptoms reported127, Level I.
In another study by Chengappa et al. (2014)128, Level I, varenicline added to CBT,
tripled 4-week continuous abstinence rates at the end of a standard 12-week course
of treatment in smokers with bipolar disorder. There were significantly more subjects
with bipolar who quit smoking with varenicline (n/n = 15/31, 48.4%) compared to
placebo (n/n = 3/29, 10.3%) (OR=8.1; 95% CI 2.03 to 32.5) at 3 months. At 6
months, 6 of 31 varenicline-treated subjects (19.4%) remained abstinent compared
to 2 of 29 (6.90%) assigned to placebo (OR=3.2; 95%CI 0.60 to 17.6).
Psychopathology scores remained stable throughout the study. Ten serious
adverse events occurred (N = 6, varenicline; n = 4, placebo) with the most common
reported as abnormal dreams occurred significantly more often in vareniclinetreated subjects (n/n = 18/31, 61.3%) than in those receiving placebo (n/n = 9/29,
31%; P = .04). Eight people treated with varenicline and 5 placebo-assigned
subjects expressed fleeting suicidal ideation, a non-significant difference.
With only two published RCT adequately powered to detect treatment efficacy in
this population, the data is currently inadequate to form a consensus guideline for
treating nicotine dependence in people with bipolar disorder. However, as currently
available treatments have been reported to be safe, all patients with bipolar should
be given pharmacological aid should they want to quit smoking.
7.4.4 Substance use disorder
7.4.4.1 Alcohol use disorder
In an open trial of the transdermal nicotine replacement therapies for smoking
cessation on 49 alcohol and drug-dependent patients (39/49 were alcohol
dependent) who entered inpatient treatment, seven subjects (14.3%) self-reported
tobacco abstinence at 21 days, and 5 (10.2%) self-reported abstinence as
outpatients at 6 weeks129, Level II-2.
There was evidence that bupropion ‚Äì sustained release (bupropion-SR) is effective
in helping alcohol dependent smokers to quit smoking. In an open-label, naturalistic
study among alcohol dependent smokers, participant who received bupropion-SR
were more likely to abstain from smoking than controls at any of the follow-up time
points, reduced their smoking and smoked less cigarettes per day (CPD) at
baseline, 30 days and 180 days post-baseline, compared to controls130, Level I.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation study involving heavydrinkers found that varenicline produced a sustained decrease in alcohol
consumption in addition to a significant decrease in the number of cigarettes
smoked131, Level I.
An open-label, pilot study suggested that varenicline may be an effective treatment
for tobacco dependence in recovering alcohol-dependent smokers132, Level II-1.
The combination of two smoking cessation treatments had no added benefit in
smokers with a dependence to alcohol based on current evidence. In a double-blind
placebo-controlled study of sustained-release bupropion with NRT as a smoking
cessation aid in 58 alcohol dependent smokers, it was found that the addition of
bupropion to NRT (nicotine patch) did not improve smoking outcomes. One third of
participants on bupropion reported discontinuing the drug during weeks 1 to 4. All
study participants however, significantly reduced cigarette use133, Level I.
7.4.4.2 Cannabis use disorder
The co-occurrence of tobacco and cannabis use is high, however, treatments of
tobacco use in this population is lacking134, Level I. A case series reported the use of
a 12-week, 9 session computer-assisted version of Motivational Enhancement
Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Contingency
Management (CM), i.e., abstinence-based incentives aimed at both tobacco and
cannabis use in those with cannabis use disorder. This programme included an
optional tobacco intervention that comprised of five computer modules in a
tailormade programme and NRT. All participants initiated the tobacco intervention
but 50% opted to use NRT. Five out of six participants made self-reported reduction
attempts during treatment (i.e., reduced cigarette use lasting at least 24 h in
duration), with a mean of 4.8 attempts (range 1‚Äì8), and cigarettes per day
decreased from intake to end of treatment 135, Level II-3.
Studies on co-occurring drug use and tobacco use, however, did not report
worsening of symptoms when using NRTs, bupropion or varenicline and therefore
all available treatments can be used20, Level I.
7.4.4.3 Opioid use disorder in methadone maintenance treatment
In general, smoking cessation rates in methadone-maintained smokers is low. To
date, only two RCT have been conducted on this group of patient. This study used
a three-group randomized design, whereby it attempted to study the efficacy of
varenicline versus placebo, in comparison with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT),
in 315 persons methadone-maintained smokers (varenicline =137, placebo=45 and
combination nicotine replacement =133). This study found that the 7-day abstinence
at 6-months was 5.4% overall, with varenicline 3.7% compared to placebo 2.2%,
and NRT 8.3% (p> .05). Between baseline and 6-months there was an overall selfreported mean reduction of 8.3 cigarettes/day. This study reported that quitting
using NRTs to be comparable to other studies and the use of varenicline did not
increase quit rates in this population136, Level I.
In another study, 383 methadone-maintained smokers were assigned randomly to
nicotine patch (8‚Äì 12 weeks) plus either (1) a baseline tailored brief motivational
intervention, a quit date behavioural skills counselling session and a relapse
prevention follow-up session or (2) brief advice using the National Cancer Institute‚Äôs
4 As model. In this study, a tailored behavioural intervention did not increase quit
rates over NRT and National Cancer Institute‚Äôs 4 As model treatment137, Level I.

7.5 Children and Adolescents
Healthcare providers should screen paediatric and adolescent patients, and their
parents, for tobacco use and exposure. Counselling and behavioural interventions that
have been shown to be effective are recommended for children and adolescents 20,
Level I; 138, Level II-1. The contents of these interventions should be modified according to
the age of the child139, Level III. When treating adolescent smokers, clinicians may
consider NRT or bupropion SR when there is evidence of nicotine dependence and
desire to quit140, Level I. However, because of the psychosocial behavioural aspects of
smoking in adolescents, clinicians should be very sure of the patient‚Äôs tobacco
dependence and intention to quit before instituting pharmacotherapy. Special
consideration should be given to the degree of dependence, number of cigarettes per
day, and body weight.
Healthcare providers in a paediatric setting should offer smoking cessation advice and
interventions to parents or guardians to limit children‚Äôs exposure to second-hand
smoke20, Level I.
Youth smokers of today are likely to become regular smokers of tomorrow. It is
estimated that 90% of smokers start smoking before the age of 18. In Malaysia, 71%
of adolescent smokers tried their first cigarette before the age of 14 year old141, Level III.
Hence it is important to reduce the amount of tobacco use (including nicotine use in
electronic cigarettes) among youth so as to decrease the rate of nicotine dependence
and subsequent morbidity and mortality in future adults142, Level II-3. Early intervention
of their nicotine dependence will increase the likelihood of them not becoming adult
smokers.
Adolescents are likely to model parents‚Äô behaviour and adopt similar norms. Youth
who have family members and close friends who smoke have a stronger predilection
to regular smoking. The role of socio-economic and demographic factors in smoking
initiation/experimentation is well documented. These factors include low socioeconomic status, smoking among family and friends, low self-esteem, poor academic
performances and behavioural problems 143, Level II-1; 144, Level II-2.
Complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days
point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those
incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational
enhancement and CBT. Given the episodic nature of adolescent smoking, more data
is needed on sustained quitting. There were few trials with evidence about
pharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none
demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. There is not yet sufficient
evidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. There
continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled
trials of interventions for this population of smokers.
7.6
Elderly
Smoking cessation in older smokers can reduce the excess risk of cardiovascular
related events and mortality even at older age145, Level II-2.
Treatment for smoking cessation can led to similar abstinence rates in older and
younger smokers146, Level II-2. Nonetheless, using age as a predictor for tailoring
smoking cessation drugs might potentially lead to a more individualized prescription
of smoking cessation therapy. For example, a study has shown that being over 60
years of age was significantly associated with increased cessation success among
those who used NRT alone, while the effectiveness of varenicline and bupropion were
not significantly different according to age groups.
Counselling interventions, physician advice, buddy support programmes, age-tailored
self-help materials, telephone counselling, and the nicotine patch all have been shown
to be effective in treating tobacco use in adults 50 and older20, Level I. Elderly smokers
with co-morbidities and psychological distress are more likely to try to stop smoking147,
Level II-2, while older adults with low psychological distress and fewer health concerns
are less likely to quit. This second group may need different sorts of motivational and
educational strategies to support smoking cessation148, Level II-2.
8.0
MANAGEMENT OF WEIGHT GAIN
For smokers who are greatly concerned about weight gain, it may be most appropriate
to prescribe or recommend bupropion SR or NRT, in particular nicotine gum, which
have been shown to delay weight gain after quitting20, Level I.
Quitting smoking is often followed by weight gain hence, health professionals involved
should:
i. Note that the health risks of weight gain are small when compared to the risks
of continued smoking
ii. Recommend physical activities and a balanced, healthy diet to control weight
iii. Recommend that patients should concentrate primarily on smoking cessation,
not weight control, until ex-smokers are confident that they will not return to
smoking.
A majority of smokers gain weight after they quit smoking. Smoking cessation is
associated with a mean increase of 4-5 kg in body weight after 12 months of
abstinence, and most weight gain occurs within three months of quitting149, Level I. It has
been reported that about 10% of quitters gain up to 15 kilograms150, Level I. However,
weight gain that follows smoking cessation is a negligible health threat compared with
the risks of continued smoking151, Level I.
Weight gain that follows smoking cessation is a negligible health threat compared with
the risks of continue smoking. Post-cessation weight gain appears to be caused both
by increased intake and by metabolic adjustments. The involvement of metabolic
mechanisms suggests that even if smokers do not increase their caloric intake upon
quitting, they will, on average, gain some weight152, Level II-1; 153, Level II-2; 154, Level II-1.
Some smoking cessation pharmacological treatments may also have limited weight
gain. Bupropion, fluoxetine, NRT and varenicline all limit weight gain during treatment
however, the effects on weight gain reduction were smaller after the treatment had
stopped and there was insufficient evidence to be sure that these effects persisted in
the long-term155, Level I; 156; Level I.
9.0
IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
It is essential to manage the treatment of tobacco use disorder at all healthcare levels
in Malaysia by using an evidence-based CPG. This aims to increase the success rate
for tobacco users to beat their nicotine addiction.
9.1
Facilitating and Limiting Factors
Existing facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG include:-
i. wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and
softcopies)
ii. training and regular update for healthcare providers
Existing barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG are:-
i.
inadequate understanding of evidence-based treatment of tobacco use
ii.
insufficient resources especially trained personnel, pharmacotherapy and
infrastructure
iii.
variation in treatment practice and preferences
9.2
Potential Resource Implications
To implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:-
i.
ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare providers
ii.
initiate training (with adequate funding) of healthcare providers ensuring
information is up-to-date
iii.
ensure availability of dedicated management team and trained including
multidisciplinary team at different levels of healthcare where appropriate
iv.
ensure widespread distribution of updated patient education materials
Implementation strategies such as Quick Reference and Training Module will be
developed following the approval of the CPG by MoH.

GLOSSARY
Abstinence. Smokers who remain smoking free at follow-up of at least 6 months after
quitting date.
Bupropion SR (bupropion sustained-release). A non-nicotine aid to smoking
cessation originally developed and marketed as an antidepressant. It is chemically
unrelated to tricyclics, tetracyclics, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or other
known antidepressant medications. Its mechanism of action is presumed to be
mediated through its capacity to block the re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine
centrally.
Clinician. A professional directly providing health care services.
Extra-treatment social support component. Interventions or elements of an
intervention wherein patients are provided with tools or assistance in obtaining social
support outside of treatment. This category is distinct from intra-treatment social
support, in which social support is delivered directly by treatment staff.
First-line
pharmacotherapy
for
tobacco
dependence.
First-line
pharmacotherapies have been found to be safe and effective for tobacco dependence
treatment and have been approved by the FDA for this use. First-line medications
have established empirical record of efficacy, and should be considered first as part
of tobacco dependence treatment except in cases of contraindications.
Intensive Clinical Intervention. Refers to interventions that involve extended
contact between clinicians and patients. It was coded based on the length of contact
between clinicians and patients (greater than 10 minutes). If that information was
unavailable, it was coded based on the content of the contact between clinicians and
patients.
Intra-treatment social support. Refers to an intervention component that is intended
to provide encouragement, a sense of concern, and interested empathic listening as
part of the treatment.
Low-intensity counselling. Low-intensity counselling refers to interventions that
involve contact between clinicians and patients and that last between 3 and 10
minutes. If the information on length of contact was unavailable, it was coded based
on the description of content of the clinical intervention.
Brief Clinical Intervention. Brief clinical intervention refers to interventions that
involve very brief contact between clinicians and patients. It was coded based on the
length of contact between clinicians and patients (3 minutes or less). If that information
was unavailable, it was coded based on the content of the clinical intervention.
Motivation. A type of intervention designed to bolster patients‚Äô resolve to quit through
manipulations such as setting a quit date, use of a contract with a specified quit date,
reinforcing correspondence (letters mailed from clinical/study staff congratulating the
patient on his or her decision to quit or on early success), providing information about
the health risks of smoking, and so on.
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Refers to a medication containing nicotine that
is intended to promote smoking cessation. There are a few nicotine replacement
therapy delivery systems currently approved for use in Malaysia. These include
nicotine chewing gum, nicotine inhaler and nicotine patch, nicotine nasal spray.
Person-to-person intervention. In-person, or face -to-face, contact between a
clinician and a patient(s) for the purpose of tobacco use intervention or assessment.
Practical counselling (problem solving/skills training). Refers to a tobacco use
treatment in which tobacco users are trained to identify and cope with events or
problems that increase the likelihood of their tobacco use. For example, quitters might
be trained to anticipate stressful events and to use coping skills such as distraction or
deep breathing to cope with an urge to smoke. Related and similar interventions are
coping skill training, relapse prevention, and stress management.
Primary care clinician. A clinician (e.g., in medicine, nursing, psychology,
pharmacology, dentistry/oral health, physical, occupational, and respiratory therapy)
who provides basic health care services for problems other than tobacco use per se.
Primary care providers are encouraged to identify tobacco users and to intervene,
regardless of whether tobacco use is the patient‚Äôs presenting problem.
Proactive telephone counselling. Treatment initiated by a clinician who telephones
and counsels the patient over the telephone.
Psychosocial interventions. Refers to intervention strategies that are designed to
increase tobacco abstinence rates due to psychological or social support
mechanisms. These interventions comprise such treatment strategies as counselling,
self-help, and behavioural treatment like rapid smoking and contingency contracting.
Quit date. The date of a given cessation attempt during which a patient tries to abstain
totally from tobacco use. Also, refers to a motivational intervention, whereby a patient
commits to quit tobacco use on a specified day.
Randomised controlled trial. For the purposes of this guideline, a study in which
subjects are assigned to conditions on the basis of chance, and where at least one of
the conditions is a control or comparison condition.
Second-hand smoke is a combination of side-stream cigarette smoke and the
exhaled main-stream smoke. Those who are exposed to second hand smoke for 15
minutes in two days within a week is defined as second-hand smokers.
Second-line pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence. Second-line medications
are pharmacotherapies for which there is evidence of efficacy for treating
tobacco dependence, but they have a more limited role than first-line medications
because: (1) the FDA has not approved them for a tobacco dependence treatment
indication, and (2) there are more concerns about potential side effects than exist
with first-line medications. Second-line treatments should be considered for use on
a case-by-case basis after first-line treatments have been used or considered.
Self-help. An intervention strategy in which the patient uses a non-pharmacologic
physical aid to achieve abstinence from tobacco. Self -help strategies typically involve
little contact with a clinician, although some strategies (e.g., hotline/helpline) involve
patient-initiated contact. Examples of types of self-help materials include: pamphlets /
booklets / mailings / manuals; videos; audios; referrals to 12-step programmes; mass
media community-level interventions; lists of community programmes; reactive
telephone hotlines/helplines; and computer programmes/Internet.
Smokeless tobacco. Any used form of unburned tobacco, including chewing
tobacco, snuff and also electronic cigarette.
Specialized assessments. Refers to assessment of patient characteristics, such
as nicotine dependence and motivation for quitting, that may allow clinicians to
tailor interventions to the needs of the individual patient.
Weight/diet/nutrition component. An intervention strategy designed to address
weight gain or concerns about weight gain. Interventions that teach diet/weight
management strategies, incorporate wee kly weight monitoring (for reasons other
than
routine
data
collection),
require
or
suggest
energy
intake
maintenance/reduction, and/or convey nutritional information/counselling.

NCSCT CLINICAL CHECKLISTS
Introduction
The National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT) has identified the
knowledge and skills that smoking cessation practitioners need for effective
behavioural support during individual face-to-face smoking cessation interventions.
Using the clinical checklists
The NCSCT clinical checklists have been divided into sections, which correspond to
the sessions outlined in the Standard Treatment Programme. They are designed to
allow practitioners to ‚Äòbuild‚Äô their portfolio of skills, and can be used as a memory aid
when seeing smokers or as a learning tool when observing other practitioners.

Appendix 5
ABC for Smoking Cessation
Ask
Ask about and document smoking status for all people (for those who
smoke or have recently stopped smoking, smoking status should be
checked and updated on a regular basis). For example, you could ask: ‚ÄòDo
you currently smoke cigarettes?‚Äô
Brief Advice
1. Provide advice to all people who smoke. For example, you could say:
‚ÄòYou may know the risks involved with smoking, but do you realise
how harmful it is? I cannot stress enough how important it is to
stop smoking. Stopping is the best thing that you can do to improve
your health. I understand that it can be hard to stop smoking, but
if you want to, I can help you.‚Äô
2. Personalise the advice (for example, if relevant explain how smoking is
related to existing health problems and how stopping smoking might
help). Highlight the benefits of quitting.
3. Acknowledge that some people make several attempts to quit before
stopping for good.
4. Document that advice was given.
Cessation
Support
There are two options for providing cessation support.
1. Refer: Health care workers without the expertise or time to help
people to stop smoking should refer smokers to smoking cessation
services.
2. Provide support: Health care workers who are able to provide
support should do so. Support can include setting a quit date; advising
the smoker that complete abstinence from smoking is best; arranging
medication to aid the quit attempt and arranging for a follow-up
consultation within a week. Assessment of the degree of nicotine
dependence helps guide treatment.
Adapted from: New Zealand Smoking Cessation Guidelines 2007
Appendix 6
Clinical Use of Pharmacotherapy in Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder
Table 6: Clinical Use of Nicotine Gum
Patient selection
Appropriate as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking
cessation.
Precautions
Pregnancy: Pregnant smokers should be encouraged to
quit first without pharmacologic treatment. Nicotine gum
should be used during pregnancy only if the increased
likelihood of smoking abstinence, with its potential benefits,
outweighs the risk of nicotine replacement and
potential concomitant smoking. Similar factors should be
considered in lactating women (FDA Class D) ‚Äì see
Appendix 7.
Cardiovascular diseases: NRT is not an independent risk
factor for acute myocardial events, but it should be used
with caution among certain cardiovascular patient groups:
those in the immediate (within 1 to 2 weeks) post
myocardial infarction period, those with serious arrhythmias,
and those with serious or worsening angina pectoris.
Side effects.
Common side effects of nicotine chewing gum include
mouth soreness, hiccups, dyspepsia, and jaw ache. These
effects are generally mild and transient, and often can be
alleviated by correcting the patient‚Äôs chewing technique
(see prescribing instructions below).
Dosage
Nicotine gum is available in 2 mg and 4 mg (per piece)
doses. The 2 mg gum is recommended for patients
smoking less than 20 cigarettes per day, while the 4 mg
gum is recommended for patients smoking 20 or more
cigarettes per day. Generally, the gum should be used for
up to 12 weeks with no more than 24 pieces/day. Clinicians
should tailor the dosage and duration of therapy to fit the
needs of each patient.
Availability
Nicorette 2 and 4 mg
Prescribing
instructions
Chewing technique: Gum should be chewed slowly until a
peppery or minty taste emerges, then parked between
cheek and gum to facilitate nicotine absorption through
the oral mucosa. Gum should be slowly and
intermittently chewed and parked for about 30 minutes or
until the taste dissipates. ‚Äì see Appendix 8.
Absorption: Eating and drinking anything except water
should be avoided for 15 minutes before and during chewing
as acidic beverages (e.g., coffee, juices, and soft drinks)
interfere with the buccal absorption of nicotine. Scheduling
of dose: Patients often do not use enough gum to get the
maximum benefit: they chew too few pieces per day and
they do not use the gum for a sufficient number of weeks.
Do not eat or drink while gum is in the mouth.
Instructions to chew the gum on a fixed schedule (at least
one piece every 1-2 hours during waking hours) for at least
1-3 months may be more beneficial than when necessary.
Table 7: Clinical Use of Nicotine Patch
Patient selection
Appropriate as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking
cessation.
Precautions
Pregnancy: Pregnant smokers should be encouraged to
quit first without pharmacological treatment. The nicotine
patch should be used during pregnancy only if the
increased likelihood of smoking abstinence, with its
potential benefits, outweighs
the
risk
of
nicotine
replacement and potential concomitant smoking. Similar
factors should be considered in lactating women. (FDA
Class D) Cardiovascular diseases. As per gum
Side effects
Skin reactions. Up to 50% of patients using the nicotine
patch will have a local skin reaction. Skin reactions are
usually mild and self-limiting, but may worsen over the
course of therapy. Local treatment with hydrocortisone
cream (1%) or triamcinolone cream (0.5%) and rotating
patch sites may reduce such local reactions. In less
than 5% of patients, such reactions require the
discontinuation of nicotine patch treatment.
Other side effect: Insomnia.
Dosage
Treatment of a t l e a s t 8 weeks has been shown to be
as efficacious as longer treatment p e r i o d s . 16- and
24-hour patches are of comparable efficacy.
Clinicians should consider individualizing treatment
based on specific patient characteristics such as
previous experience with the patch, amount smoked,
degree of addictiveness, etc. Finally, clinicians should
consider starting treatment on a lower patch dose in
patients smoking 10 or fewer cigarettes per day.
Availability
Niquitin (21, 14 and 7 mg, respectively), Nicorette 25,15
and 10 mg
Niquitin¬Æ
If smoking 10 cigarettes or more a day, start with Step 1 (21
mg) and gradually move to step 2 (14 mg) after 6 weeks and
then step 3 (7 mg) for 2 weeks, as directed on pack over 10
weeks. If smoking less than 10 cigarettes a day, start at
Step 2 and follow the 8 week programme described on the
pack.
Nicorette¬Æ
15 mg x 8 weeks, then 10 mg x 2 weeks and finally 5 mg
x 2 weeks
Prescribing
instructions
Location. The patient should place a new patch on a
relatively hairless location, typically between the neck and
waist, usually upper arm or shoulder. Rotate and avoid
using the same site of application for about 1 week (see
Appendix 9).
Activities : No restriction while using the patch
Time: Patches may be applied as soon as the patient
wakes up. In patients who experience sleep disruption,
advise the patient to remove the 24- hour patch prior to
bedtime or use the 16-hour patch. Smokers with time-tofirst cigarette (TTFC) of 30 minutes or less may benefit
from putting the patch immediately before sleeping, so
that the plasma nicotine level is highest upon waking up 6
to 8 hours post application of the patch. Remove the patch
after 16 or 24 hours.
Table 8: Clinical Use of Nicotine Inhaler
Patient selection
Appropriate as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking
cessation.
Precautions
Pregnancy and cardiovascular diseases. As for nicotine
gum.
Side effects
Local irritation reactions: Local irritation in the mouth and
throat was observed in 40% of patients using the nicotine
inhaler. Coughing and rhinitis occur in 32% and 23%,
respectively. Severity was generally rated as mild, and the
frequency of such symptoms declined with continued use.
Dosage
A dose from the nicotine inhaler consists of a puff or
inhalation.
Each cartridge delivers 4 mg of nicotine over 80 inhalations.
Recommended
dosage
is
6-16
cartridges/day.
Recommended duration of therapy is up to 6 months.
Instruct patient to taper dosage during the final 3 months of
treatment.
Availability
4 mg/cartridge
Prescribing
Ambient temperature: The inhaler and cartridges should
be kept at room temperature.
Duration: Use is recommended for up to 6 months with
gradual reduction in frequency of use over the last 6-12
weeks of treatment.
Absorption: Acidic beverages (e.g., coffee, juices, and
soft drinks) interfere with the buccal absorption of nicotine,
so eating and drinking anything except water should be
avoided for 15 minutes before and during inhalation.
Best effects: Best effects are achieved by frequent puffing.
Table 9: Clinical Use of Nicotine Lozenge
Patient selection
Appropriate as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking
cessation. As an aid to smoking cessation, by treatment of
tobacco dependence through the relief of nicotine withdrawal
symptoms, including cravings.

Table 10: Clinical Use of Varenicline
Patient selection
Appropriate as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking
cessation.
Use in pregnancy: There are no adequate data from the use
of varenicline in pregnant women. Studies in animals have
shown reproductive toxicity. The potential risk for humans is
unknown. Varenicline should not be used during pregnancy
(FDA Category C)
Precautions
Effect of Smoking Cessation: Physiological changes
resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment
with varenicline, may alter the pharmacokinetics or
pharmacodynamics of some medicinal products, for which
dosage adjustment may be necessary (examples include
theophylline, warfarin and insulin). As smoking induces
CYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of
plasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates.
Smoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has
been associated with the exacerbation of underlying
psychiatric illness (e.g. depression). Care should be taken
with patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients
should be advised accordingly.
There is no clinical experience with varenicline in patients
with epilepsy.
At the end of treatment, discontinuation of varenicline was
associated with an increase in irritability, urge to smoke,
depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The
prescriber should inform the patient accordingly and discuss
or consider the need for dose tapering.
Depressed mood may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal.
Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide
attempt, has been reported in patients undergoing a smoking
cessation attempt. These symptoms have also been
reported while attempting to quit smoking with varenicline.
Clinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of
significant
depressive
symptomatology
in
patients
undergoing a smoking cessation attempt, and should advise
patients accordingly.
Effects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery:
Varenicline may have minor or moderate influence on the
ability to drive and use machines. Varenicline may cause
dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the
ability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not
to drive, operate complex machinery or engage in other
potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether
varenicline affects their ability to perform these activities.
Use in lactation: It is unknown whether varenicline is
excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that
varenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether
to continue / discontinue breastfeeding or to continue /
discontinue therapy with varenicline should be made taking
into account the benefit of breastfeeding to the child and the
benefit of varenicline therapy to the woman.
Side effects
In general, when adverse reactions occurred, onset was in
the 1st week of therapy; severity was generally mild to
moderate and there were no differences by age, race or
gender with regard to the incidence of adverse reactions.
In patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice
daily following an initial titration period, the adverse event
most commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the
majority of cases, nausea occurred early in the treatment
period which was mild to moderate in severity and seldom
resulted in discontinuation. The treatment discontinuation
rate due to adverse events was 11.4% for varenicline
compared with 9.7% for placebo. In this group, the
discontinuation rates for the most common adverse events
in varenicline-treated patients were as follows: Nausea
(2.7% vs 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs 1% for
placebo), insomnia (1.3% vs 1.2% for placebo) and
abnormal dreams (0.2% vs 0.2% for placebo).
In the following text, all adverse reactions, which occurred at
an incidence greater than placebo are listed by system organ
class and frequency [very common (‚â•1/10), common
(‚â•1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (‚â•1/1000 to <1/100) and rare
(‚â•1/10,000 to <1/1000)]. Within each frequency grouping,
undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing
seriousness.

Post-marketing cases of myocardial infarction, depression
and suicidal ideation have been reported in patients taking
varenicline.
Dosage
The recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily
following a 1-week titration as follows: Days 1-3: 0.5 mg once
daily; Days 4-7: 0.5 mg twice daily; Day 8-end of treatment:
1 mg twice daily.
Patients who cannot tolerate adverse effects of varenicline
may have the dose temporarily or permanently lowered to
0.5 mg twice daily.
Patients with Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is
necessary for patients with mild (estimated creatinine
clearance >50 mL/min and ‚â§80 mL/min) to moderate
(estimated creatinine clearance ‚â•30 mL/min and ‚â§50
mL/min) renal impairment.
For patients with moderate renal impairment who experience
adverse events that are not tolerable, dosing may be
reduced to 1 mg once daily.
For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated
creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the recommended dose
is 1 mg once daily. Dosing should begin at 0.5 mg once daily
for the first 3 days then increased to 1 mg once daily. Based
on insufficient clinical experience in patients with end-stage
renal disease, treatment is not recommended in this patient
population.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is
necessary for patients with hepatic impairment.
Elderly: No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly
patients. However, since elderly patients are more likely to
have decreased renal function, prescribers should consider
the renal status of an elderly patient.
Children: varenicline is not recommended for use in children
or adolescents <18 years due to insufficient data on safety
and efficacy.
Prescribing
instruction
The patient should set a date to stop smoking. Dosing should
start 1-2 weeks before this date. Tablets should be
swallowed whole with water, can be taken with or without
food, but incidence of nausea increases when taken on an
empty stomach.
Patients should be treated for 12 weeks.
For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the
end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 12 weeks treatment
with 1 mg twice daily may be considered.
No data are available on the efficacy of an additional 12
weeks course of treatment for patients who do not succeed
in stopping smoking during initial therapy or who relapse
after treatment.
In smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is
elevated in the period immediately following the end of
treatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose
tapering may be considered.
When
varenicline
and
transdermal NRT
were
coadministered to smokers for 12 days, there was a statistically
significant decrease in average systolic blood pressure
(mean 2.6 mmHg) measured on the final day of the study. In
this study, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting,
dizziness, dyspepsia, and fatigue was greater for the
combination than for NRT alone.
Table 11: Clinical Use of Bupropion
Patient selection
Appropriate as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking
cessation.
Precautions
Pregnant smokers should be encouraged to quit first
without pharmacologic treatment. Bupropion SR should
be used during pregnancy only if the increased likelihood
of smoking abstinence, with its potential benefits,
outweighs the risk of bupropion SR treatment and
potential concomitant smoking (FDA Category C).
Similar factors should be considered in lactating women
(FDA Class B).
Cardiovascular diseases: Generally well tolerated;
infrequent reports of hypertension.
Side effects: The most common side effects reported by
bupropion SR users were insomnia (35-40%) and dry
mouth (10%).
Contraindications: Bupropion SR is contraindicated in
individuals with a history of seizure disorder, a history
of an eating disorder, who are using another form of
bupropion (Wellbutrin SR) or who have used an MAO
inhibitor in the past 14 days.
Close monitoring of patients for clinical worsening,
emergence of suicidality, agitation, irritability & unusual
changes in behaviour. Patient with history of seizure,
cranial trauma or other predisposition toward seizure, or
patients taking seizure threshold-lowering agents.
Excessive use or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol or
sedatives. Renal or hepatic impairment including mild to
moderate & severe liver cirrhosis. Patients w/ a recent
history of MI or unstable heart disease. False +ve urine
immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines. May
affect ability to drive or operate machinery.
Dosage
Patients should begin with a dose of 150 mg q AM for 3
days, then increase to 150 mg b.i.d. Dosing at 150 mg
b.i.d. should continue for 7-12 weeks following the quit
date. Unlike nicotine replacement products, patients
should begin bupropion SR treatment 1-2 weeks before
they quit smoking.
For maintenance therapy, consider bupropion SR 150 mg
b.i.d. for up to 6 months.
Availability
Pregnant smokers should be encouraged to quit first
without pharmacologic treatment. Bupropion SR should
be used during pregnancy only if the increased likelihood
of smoking abstinence, with its potential benefits,
outweighs the risk of bupropion SR treatment and
potential concomitant smoking (FDA Category C).
Similar factors should be considered in lactating women
(FDA Class B).
Cardiovascular diseases: Generally well tolerated;
infrequent reports of hypertension.
Side effects: The most common side effects reported by
bupropion SR users were insomnia (35-40%), headache
(25-34%) and dry mouth (10%).
Contraindications: Bupropion SR is contraindicated in
individuals with a history of seizure disorder, a history
of an eating disorder, who are using another form of
bupropion (Wellbutrin SR) or who have used an MAO
inhibitor in the past 14 days.
Close monitoring of patients for clinical worsening,
emergence of suicidality, agitation, irritability & unusual
changes in behaviour. Patient with history of seizure,
cranial trauma or other predisposition toward seizure, or
patients taking seizure threshold-lowering agents.
Excessive use or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol or
sedatives. Renal or hepatic impairment including mild to
moderate & severe liver cirrhosis. Patients w/ a recent
history of MI or unstable heart disease. False +ve urine
immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines. May
affect ability to drive or operate machinery.
Prescribing
instructions
Appropriate as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking
cessation.
Scheduling of dose: if insomnia is marked, take the PM
dose earlier (in the afternoon, at least 8 hours after the
first dose) may provide some relief.
Appendix 7
FDA Pregnancy Class
Category Description
A
Medicines are considered safe to be used throughout pregnancy.
Medicines have been taken by a large number of pregnant women and
women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency
of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the foetus.
B
Medicines which have been taken by only a limited number of pregnant
women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the
frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects
on the human foetus. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an
increased occurrence of foetal damage, or are inadequate or may be
lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence
of foetal damage, or there are evidence of an increased occurrence of
foetal damage, but the significance of which is considered uncertain in
humans.
C
Medicines which have caused or may be suspected of causing harmful
effects on the human foetus or newborn infant without causing
malformations. These effects may be reversible. Medicines must only
be given only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the
foetus.
D
Medicines that have caused, are suspected to have caused or may be
expected to cause an increased incidence of human foetal
malformations or irreversible damage. The use is warranted only in
life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer
medicines cannot be used or ineffective.
X
Medicines which have such a high risk of causing permanent damage to
the foetus that they should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a
possibility of pregnancy.
