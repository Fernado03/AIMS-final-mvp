The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are meant to be guides for
clinical practice, based on the best available evidence at the time of
development. Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily
guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is
responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the
clinical picture presented by the patient and the management options
available locally.
These guidelines were issued in 2010 and will be reviewed in 2014 or
sooner if new evidence becomes available.

GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT
The Development Group for this Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG)
was from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Higher Education
and private sector. They consisted of paediatric endocrinologists,
paediatricians, adult endocrinologists, a geriatrician, a family medicine
specialist, public health physicians and a pharmacist. There was
active involvement of the Review Committee during the process of
development of these guidelines.
Literature search was carried out at the following electronic databases:
PUBMED/MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews
(CDSR), International Health Technology Assessment websites, Journal
full text via OVID search engine, Database of Abstracts of Reviews
of Effectiveness and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Refer to
Appendix 1 for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists of all
retrieved articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Experts
in the ﬁeld were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches
were conducted between 20 January 2009 and 11 August 2010. This
date period should be considered the starting point for searching of new
evidence for future updates to these guidelines.
Reference was also made to other guidelines on Growth Hormone e.g.
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Medical guidelines
For Clinical Practice for Growth Hormone Use in Adults and Children2003 update; American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists
Medical Guidelines for Clinical Practice for Growth Hormone Use in
Growth Hormone Deﬁcient Adults and Transition Patients Children2009 update; Guidelines for the Availability of Human Growth Hormone

Twenty four clinical questions were developed under three subgroups
and members of the development group were assigned individual
questions within these subtopics. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical
Questions). The group members met a total of 26 times throughout the
development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised
by at least two members and presented in the form of evidence
tables and discussed during development group meetings. Later, all
statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by
both the development group and review committee. Where evidence
was insufﬁcient, the recommendations were made by consensus of
the development group and review committee. These CPG are based
mainly on the ﬁndings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical
trials, with local practices taken into consideration.
The articles were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive
Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of
recommendation in these guidelines was modiﬁed from grades of
recommendation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network
(SIGN).
The draft guideline was posted on the MOH Malaysia ofﬁcial website
for comment and feedback. These guidelines had also been presented
to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG
Council, MOH, Malaysia for review and approval.

The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults

1. INTRODUCTION
Growth hormone (GH) has been used in clinical practice since 1950s.
The initial source of GH was human cadaver pituitary extract. The
supply was scarce and the scope of GH usage then was limited only to
children with proven GH deﬁciency. In 1985, pituitary-derived GH was
banned because of its association with Creutzfeld Jacob disease. This
triggered an acceleration in the biosynthesis of GH via recombinant
DNA technology. Today there is an abundant supply of biosynthetic GH
commercially. The use of GH has also expanded markedly beyond GH
deﬁciency to conditions without GH deﬁciency where data regarding its
efﬁcacy and safety in these conditions are still lacking.
In Malaysia, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been
commercially available since 1985. However, despite its increased
availability, many GH deﬁcient (GHD) children are still deprived of rhGH
therapy due to its high cost and concerns regarding its long-term safety.
On the contrary, the broadening of scope of GH therapy also has its
drawbacks including its increasing use and abuse of GH in a broad
variety of growth disorders without evidence of GH deﬁciency.
rhGH therapy should not be taken lightly in view of its high cost, the
need of prolonged therapy with close follow up by practicing clinicians
familiar with rhGH therapy, potential adverse effects and the negative
psychological impact from unsuccessful therapy.
In a 25 kg child, at low dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day, the cost of rhGH
approximates RM950 per month (RM11,400 per year). The cost
escalates as rhGH dose requirement increases and the child grows
in stature reaching a hefty sum of more than RM2,000 per month.
The duration of rhGH therapy could range from four to ten years for
optimisation of linear growth to lifelong for severe childhood-onset or
adult-onset GH deﬁciency.
In adults, the indications for GH therapy are well deﬁned but the
enthusiasm for rhGH use has also far exceeded medical evidence. Unlike
that in children, the lack of linear growth in adults renders response to
rhGH therapy more difﬁcult to measure. These CPG speciﬁcally aim
to evaluate the scientiﬁc and clinical evidence of appropriate rhGH
use and abuse in order to put these “indications” into their respective
scientiﬁc contexts.

1.1 GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY IN CHILDREN
GH deﬁciency in children results from developmental abnormalities
or diseases affecting the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Causes
of developmental abnormalities include genetic defects affecting the
GH gene, Pit-1 gene or POU1F1 gene that regulate development
of pituitary cells secreting GH, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH),
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyrotropin. Diseases of the
hypothalamus and pituitary may result from acquired causes such as
pituitary tumours, craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis,
infection of the central nervous system, traumatic head injury and whole
body or cranial irradiation.
The most common presentation of GH deﬁciency in children is stunted
growth. In view of a wide spectrum of causes of stunted growth in
children, evaluation for GH deﬁciency in a short child should not be
initiated until other causes of growth failure such as hypothyroidism,
chronic systemic diseases, syndromic disorders including Turner
syndrome (TS) and skeletal disorders have been considered and
appropriately excluded. In neonates and infants, signs and symptoms
of GH deﬁciency differ from older children. While deviation from linear
growth is the primary presentation in older children, metabolic effects of
GHD are the primary presentation in neonates and infants.
1.2
WHO SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR GH DEFICIENCY?
The consensus guidelines (GH Research Group, 2000) recognised
the key facts in history and physical examination that may indicate
GH deﬁciency in the neonates. These include neonatal history of
persistent hypoglycaemia, prolonged neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia,
microphallus, traumatic delivery or presence of craniofacial midline
abnormalities.1, Level III; 2, Level II, 3, level II; Positive history of intracranial
tumour,4, level II-3 cranial surgery, head injury either from complications
at birth or from trauma,5, Level I; 6, level II-3 central nervous system infection,
cranial irradiation7, Level III should also alert the clinician of the diagnosis
of GH deﬁciency in a short and slowly growing child.

Recommendation
In neonates/infants, evaluation for GH deﬁciency should be conducted
if they manifest persistent, intractable hypoglycaemia ± convulsions
associated with any of the following:
• Micropenis in a male infant
• Prolonged neonatal jaundice
• Midline craniofacial defects (such as cleft palate, cleft lip, nasal or
frontal encephalocoele, single central incisor, visual impairment,
optic nerve hypoplasia)*
• Traumatic delivery (breech) or perinatal asphyxia*
• Post-natal failure to thrive (affecting both length and weight)
(Grade C)
In older children, evaluation for GH deﬁciency should be conducted if
history is positive for any of the following:
• Surgery to the hypothalamic pituitary region*
• Cranial irradiation*
• Intracranial tumour such as craniopharyngioma*
• Traumatic brain injury (accidental or non-accidental)*
• Central nervous system infection*
• Signs and symptoms of multiple pituitary hormones deﬁciency
(MPHD)
• Signs indicative of intracranial lesion*
• Parental consanguinity ± an affected family member (genetic
cause)
• Failure to show normal growth spurt by breast stage 3 in girls and
genital stage 3 in boys. (Grade C)

USE OF GROWTH HORMONE IN GROWTH HORMONE
DEFICIENT (GHD) CHILDREN
Diagnosis of GH deﬁciency in childhood is a multifaceted process
requiring a combination of clinical and auxological criteria, biochemical
tests and radiological evaluation. growth 8 ; Level III
2.1
DIAGNOSIS OF GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY IN
CHILDREN
2.1.1 Clinical and Auxological Criteria
The GH Research Society Consensus Guidelines (2000) and American
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE, 2003) recommend
the following clinical and auxological criteria to identify GH
deﬁciency:9, Level III; 8, Level II;
i.
Severe short stature, deﬁned as height >3 standard deviation (SD)
below the mean
ii.
Height >1.5 SD below mid-parental-height (MPH)
iii. Height >2 SD below mean and height velocity (HV) over one year
>1 SD below the mean for chronological age (CA) or a decrease in
height by >0.5 SD over one year in children over 2 years of age
iv. In the absence of short stature, HV >2 SD below the mean over
one year or >1.5 SD below the mean sustained over two years
v.
Signs of intracranial lesion
vi. Signs of MPHD
vii. Neonatal symptoms and signs of GH deﬁciency
In Malaysia, growth charts in SD are not available. However, National
Child Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts in centiles are available in
most clinics. For this reason the following equivalents are used.10, level III

Pitfalls in auxology: Although auxology is a simple, non-invasive tool
for deﬁning population at risk for GH deﬁciency, it has its limitations
in clinical use. Height measurements may be imprecise due to errors
related to operator and/or measuring tool. Errors can also occur in the
calculation of HV due to seasonal variation in growth and short time
interval between measurements. To minimise errors in HV, serial height
measurements should be performed by a trained personnel, using an
appropriate tool and a longer time interval between measurements
(which should not be less than three months).
However, Voss LD et al. showed no correlation between HV in two
consecutive years in short normal children and GHD children which
indicated severe imprecision of HV.11, level II-2 Hintz also showed
no signiﬁcant difference in height standard deviation score (SDS)
and HV between GHD and idiopathic short stature (ISS).12, Level II-2
Using a HV less than 25th percentile to diagnose GH deﬁciency has a
high sensitivity (82%) but poor speciﬁcity (43%).13, Level II-3 Hence using
auxology alone is inadequate for the diagnosis of GHD. Auxology must
be interpreted in combination with other parameters.
2.1.2 Biochemical Tests
GH stimulation tests play a critical role in diagnosis of GH deﬁciency.
The most frequently used tests include the insulin tolerance test (ITT)
and glucagon stimulation test (GST). Other stimulation tests using
pharmacologic agents such as arginine, growth hormone-releasing
hormone (GHRH) with or without arginine, levodopa and clonidine
have been used.14, Level II-2 In local setting, only ITT, GST and arginine
stimulation test (AST) are used due to unavailability of other agents.
Peak plasma GH level of <10 mcg/L during GH stimulation tests using
pharmacologic agents has been used as the biochemical criteria for the
diagnosis of GH deﬁciency.9, Level III; 8, Level II; Cut-off value of <10 mcg/L is
arbitrarily used to deﬁne GH deﬁciency. A minimum of two stimulation
tests indicating GH deﬁciency are required for biochemical conﬁrmation
of the diagnosis because of the high frequency of negative results for a
single test.15, Level II-3
Insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin growth factor binding
protein-3 (IGFBP-3) are helpful parameters for diagnosis of GH
deﬁciency. IGF-1 concentration level must be carefully interpreted
as the values are speciﬁc but not sensitive. Many factors such as
nutritional status, sex steroid, thyroid hormone and chronic diseases
affect IGF-1 concentrations. IGFBP-3 is dependent on age and pubertal
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
6
status. Hence reference ranges standardised for age and sex are
imperative.16, Level III; 13, Level II-3
The difﬁculty in diagnosing GH deﬁciency during the peripubertal
period is acknowledged, as low GH levels in stimulation tests frequently
occur. Sex-steroid priming prior to GH stimulation tests reduces the
percentage of false positive for GH deﬁciency.17, Level 1; 18, Level II-3 Hence
sex-steroid priming may play a role in reducing the number of false
positive results in the peripubertal children. Children with MPHD should
receive adequate adrenal and thyroid hormone replacement before
biochemical evaluation of GH deﬁciency.
GH Testing in the neonate: GH level should be measured in the event
of neonatal hypoglycemia in the absence of a metabolic disorder. A
random GH measurement in a polyclonal radioimmunoassay of <20
mcg/L would suggest GH deﬁciency in the newborn. An IGFBP3 measurement is of value for the diagnosis of GHD infant.9, Level III
ITT is regarded as the gold standard for the evaluation of pituitary
growth hormone reserve. In ITT, insulin is administered intravenously
to produce a nadir in the plasma glucose level of ≤ 2.2 mmol/L. This
is a potentially hazardous procedure and must be done only by an
experienced endocrinologist in a tertiary centre.
Pitfalls in biochemical tests: GH in circulation consists of a wide
variety of molecular isoforms. As a consequence, assays involving
polyclonal antisera give higher results than those based on monoclonal
assays. Discrepancy between results obtained from two different
assays depends on factors related to the assay (antibody speciﬁcity
and assay design) and also factors related to individual sample (relative
abundance of isoforms present). Therefore it is impossible to compare
results from different immunoassays from different laboratories.19, Level III
GH stimulation tests lack precision, accuracy and have poor
reliability.20, Level III; 15, Level II-3 The lack of reliability of these tests
might be improved by performing the same test more than
once.15, Level II-3 Factors like puberty, genetic target height SDS,
height SDS, weight SDS, bone age and the pharmacologic agents
used can affect peak plasma GH level.15, Level II-3 Spontaneous GH
secretion is more speciﬁc than pharmacologic testing. However,
serial testing is resource intensive and time-consuming.21, Level II-2
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults

2.1.3 Radiological Evaluation
A plain radiograph of the left hand and wrist to assess osseous maturation
(bone age) is helpful in making the diagnosis of GH deﬁciency. A delayed
bone age of at least two years compared to chronological age is a
feature of GH deﬁciency. However it is not diagnostic of the condition.
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography
(CT scan) of the brain with particular attention to the hypothalamicpituitary region should be carried out in any child diagnosed with
GH deﬁciency. In a cross-sectional study by Nagel et al., presence
of ectopic posterior pituitary, missing stalk and hypoplastic anterior
pituitary (EMH) on MRI is a signiﬁcant predictor of permanent
severe GH deﬁciency with or without other pituitary hormone
deﬁciency.22 ,Level III However, a normal MRI does not exclude GH
deﬁciency. A study by Geralda et al. demonstrated that approximately
20% of the subjects with GH deﬁciency had mutations of GH-1, GHRHR, PIT-1 and PROP-1 genes causing permanent disease. All patients
with these genetic causes had normal pituitary stalk and normal position
of posterior pituitary gland while 50% had pituitary hypoplasia. 23, Level III
Recommendation
All of the following criteria must be fulﬁlled to conﬁrm the diagnosis of
GH deﬁciency:
i. Clinical and auxological criteria:
• Short stature as deﬁned by:
ÿ Height <3rd centile on the NCHS chart
AND/OR
ÿ Height below target height (TH) range i.e. MPH minus 10 cm
AND
• Slow growth as deﬁned by:
ÿ Downward deviation of height ≥1 centile band over at least 12
months
Children with acquired hypothalamic-pituitary disease are considered
to have fulﬁlled the above criteria if they have slow growth even in the
absence of short stature.
ii. Biochemical criteria
A minimum of TWO growth hormone stimulation tests using either
ITT, GST or AST are needed.
• Peak GH level of <10 mcg/L is diagnostic
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
8
Sex steroid priming is useful for peripubertal children. Children with
MPHD should have received adequate adrenal and thyroid hormone
replacement before biochemical evaluation.
iii. Radiological criteria
• Delayed bone age
(Grade C)
After conﬁrmation of GH deﬁciency, subsequent investigations should
include:
i. MRI of hypothalamic-pituitary region
ii. Genetic study (if facilities are available) (Grade C)
2.1.4 Criteria for Referral
Patients with the following criteria should be referred to paediatric
endocrinologists for further evaluation, conﬁrmation and appropriate
therapy for GH deﬁciency:
• Neonates/infants with features of GH deﬁciency (refer to section 1.2)
• Children at risk of GH deﬁciency showing slow growth and/or short
stature (refer to section 1.2)
• Children who fulﬁll the above clinical and auxological criteria for GH
deﬁciency
2.2
TREATMENT OF GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY IN
CHILDREN
A healthy child should experience a normal growth and ultimately
reach an adult height within his/her TH range.24, Level II-2 A child with
GH deﬁciency is expected to be short, growing slowly and have
extremely short adult height. Studies had shown that in these children,
normalisation of height in childhood and attainment of a normal adult
height could be achieved by using the lowest possible cumulative
dose of GH.25, Level 1; 24, Level II-2 Cohort studies had also demonstrated
that it is possible to achieve a ﬁnal height (FH) within TH range
in idiopathic GHD patients when treated with GH from an early
age.26, Level II-2; 27, Level II-2; 28, Level II-3
The primary objectives for GH deﬁciency therapy are normalisation of
height during childhood and attainment of normal adult height.8, Level III
Target height range is ±10 cm of the MPH.
Final adult height is achieved when the height gain in a year is <0.5 cm AND/
OR a bone age of ≥15.5 years for girls and ≥16.5 years for boys.29, Level I
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
9
Near-adult height is deﬁned as a bone age of 16 year or more for males
and 14 year or more for females and a growth rate less than 2 cm/year
for one year
2.2.1 Initiation
GH therapy should begin as soon as possible to optimise long-term
growth.30, Level II-2 The GH Research Society Consensus Guidelines
2000 recommends that patients with proven GH deﬁciency should be
treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) as soon as
possible after the diagnosis is made. Every effort should be made to
diagnose and treat children at the youngest possible age.8, Level III
Prospective cohort and controlled studies had shown good catch-up
growth in children when given early rhGH replacement.31, 30, Level II-2; 32,
Level II-3; 33, Level II-2; 34, Level II-2
In the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS) where rhGH therapy
was started at peripubertal age, there was insufﬁcient increase in the
child’s height SDS before the onset of puberty resulting in failure to
achieve target height SDS. Hence early initiation of rhGH treatment
and attainment of higher prepubertal height SDS before onset of
puberty are important factors to improve FH of GHD children.28, Level II-3
Recommendation
GHD children should be treated with rhGH as soon as possible after the
diagnosis is made. (Grade C)
2.2.2 Dosage
It has been shown that 84% of GHD patients who received 0.025
mg/kg/day of rhGH for at least 5.4 years reached a FH within
the normal population height range.35, Level II-3 Findings from the
KIGS database (n=1258) showed that those treated from an early
age with a median rhGH dose of 0.025 - 0.028 mg/kg/day for at
least four years achieved a FH within their TH range.27, Level II-3
Short-term and long-term studies among non-GH naive patients
showed that higher dose of rhGH resulted in a signiﬁcantly
greater HV, height for CA and FH without any difference in bone
age advancement, onset of puberty, fasting glucose, HbA1c or
lipid metabolism.36, Level I; 25, Level II-2 A randomised controlled study
(RCT) demonstrated that the difference in height SDS at the end of
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
10
treatment was signiﬁcantly increased in those who received 0.05 or
0.1 mg/ kg/d of rhGH compared to those who received 0.025 mg/kg/d.
However, another RCT found no signiﬁcant difference noted in height
SDS between those who received 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg/day.37, Level I
Studies had also demonstrated that catch-up growth and total height
gain were greater among the daily-treated patients compared to those
who received two, three or four times weekly rhGH injections at the
same total weekly dose, with no signiﬁcant difference in skeletal
maturation and onset of puberty.38, Level I ; 39, Level II-1
Studies involving pre-pubertal GH naive patients showed growth
responses improved by titrating the GH dose to achieve higher IGF1 targets or guided by individual GH responsiveness obtained from a
prediction model.40, Level I; 41, Level I
Factors that correlated with enhanced adult height were baseline height,
younger age at onset of treatment, longer treatment duration especially
during pre-pubertal years and a greater growth velocity during the ﬁrst
year of treatment.27, Level II-3
Recommendation
GH dose should be started at 0.025 mg/kg/day and adjusted within the
range of 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg/day based on the growth response and
IGF-1 level. (Grade A)
rhGH should be given as a daily subcutaneous injection seven days a
week. (Grade A)
rhGH therapy should be given uninterrupted for at least four years prior
to closure of the epiphyses. (Grade C)
2.2.3 Monitoring
Updates of the GH Guidelines by the LWPES recommend that routine
follow-up for paediatric GHD patients should be performed by a
paediatric endocrinologist in partnership with the paediatrician or primary
care physician and should be conducted on a 3- to 6-monthly basis, to
document auxological data, monitor treatment response, compliance
and safety. Adequate growth response to GH therapy is evidenced by
an increase in HV within the ﬁrst six month of therapy and an increase
of at least 0.25 height SDS over one year period.42, Level III
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
11
To ensure adequate dosing, compliance and safety (in the
light of association between elevated serum IGF-1 and certain
cancers),43, Level III serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 should be monitored at
least yearly.42, Level III A cohort study with serial measurements at ﬁvetime points (baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months during the ﬁrst year
of GH treatment) showed that IGF-1 levels were highest at 6 weeks and
remained relatively constant thereafter. IGF-1 SDS was also found to
correlate well with the dose of GH (expressed in IU/m2/week).44, Level II-2
A larger increase in serum IGF-1 was associated with more impressive
initial growth, and greater ﬁrst year growth response.45, Level II-2
For patients who display a suboptimal growth response or in whom the
IGF levels remain persistently low with assurance of good compliance
to injection schedule, it is reasonable to increase the GH dose within
the FDA approved dose guidelines (0.025 - 0.050 mg/kg/day in
children, or 0.025 - 0.10 mg/kg/day in adolescents). Dose reductions
should be considered in patients with serum IGF-1 levels substantially
above the normal range after the ﬁrst two years of therapy. Further
treatment is generally futile if no increase in growth rate or serum IGF-1
concentration over baseline is detected within the ﬁrst 6 to 12 months in
a compliant patient receiving an appropriate dose of GH.42, Level III
Growth hormone therapy guided by regular monitoring of bone age (BA)
has been shown to be useful in children treated with rhGH. It has been
demonstrated that subjects who had BA assessment at entry, during
the ﬁrst year of rhGH therapy and serially for the ﬁrst three years had
higher cumulative height SDS and height age change compared with
those subjects without BA values at entry, without BA in the ﬁrst year
and those without serial BA x-rays. It was concluded that subjects with
BA monitoring do better than those whose skeletal maturation were not
measured.46, Level II-3
One of the most important risks in GH therapy is the incidence of
leukaemia and malignancy. In view of this, patients who have a history
of childhood cancer or a diagnosis that predisposes them to malignancy
should be monitored closely for malignancy.47, Level III Monitoring of free
T4 and TSH is of value for detecting hypothyroidism which may be
observed during rhGH therapy.42, Level III
rhGH therapy has been shown to reduce insulin sensitivity
with a compensatory hyperinsulinaemia and hence increases the
risk
of
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
(T2DM)
in
predisposed
individuals.48, Level II-1; 49, Level II-1 As the dose of rhGH used in children
is generally higher than that used in adults, it is not surprising to note
that incidence of T2DM was reported as six-fold higher in children
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
12
treated with rhGH compared with age-matched untreated children.
rhGH might have hastened the onset of T2DM. The study also showed
that diabetes mellitus did not resolve after rhGH was stopped, hence
excluding a transient drug-induced effect. The author recommended
that each child’s glucose status should be determined before starting
rhGH therapy by measuring HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and insulin
concentration. Follow up of children at risk of T2DM such as obesity,
Turner syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation, Prader-Willi syndrome
and GH deﬁciency secondary to other causes is important.50, Level II-3
At the recommended GH dose, a typical growth hormone deﬁcient child
accelerates growth from a pre-treatment rate of 3 - 4 cm/year to:
• 10 - 12 cm/year in the ﬁrst year of therapy
• 7 - 9 cm/year in the second and third year
Progressive waning of GH efﬁcacy then occurs.37, Level 1
Patients who have a history of childhood cancer or a diagnosis that
predisposes them to malignancy should be monitored closely for
recurrence or second malignancy.
Recommendation
GHD children on rhGH therapy should be routinely monitored for:
• height: 3 to 6 monthly (Grade C)
• serum IGF-1: 3 monthly in the ﬁrst year, then yearly (Grade C)
• free T4, TSH: yearly (Grade C)
• fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C and insulin: before starting rhGH
therapy (Grade C)
• HbA1c: yearly or more frequently in patients at risk for type 2
diabetes mellitus (Grade C)
• bone age: prior to starting rhGH therapy and yearly thereafter
(Grade C)
In patient with poor GH response over 6 to 12 months (HV <2 cm/year
above pre-treatment HV):
• check patient compliance (Grade C)
In compliant patients with poor GH response:
• if IGF-1 is low or normal, increase rhGH dose (Grade C)
• if IGF-1 has exceeded the normal range, stop rhGH (Grade C)
• if patient is already on the maximum recommended dose, stop hGH
(Grade C)

2.2.4 Beneﬁts
a.
Final Height
Data from the Pﬁzer International Growth Database (KIGS) showed
differences between near-adult height and MPH ranged between -0.6
and -0.2 SDS. Results from Caucasian males with IGHD showed a
median SDS of -2.4 at start of treatment and -0.8 at near adult height
after rhGH treatment.27, Level II-3 Similar results were shown in a subset of
Swedish subjects derived from the KIGS database.26, Level II-3
It is possible to attain target height in GHD children with optimal rhGH
therapy.
b.
Metabolic effects
Several studies have shown that GH therapy improved body composition
by increasing lean tissue mass and reducing percentage body
fat.51, Level II-2; 52, Level II-2; 53, Level II-2; 54, Level II-2
Other studies have reported improvement in lipid proﬁles with
rhGH therapy: reduction in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein
(LDL) and triglycerides, and increase in high density lipoprotein
(HDL).48, Level II-1; 52,level II-2 However, not all baseline lipid proﬁles are
abnormal in children with GH deﬁciency. Nevertheless, during rhGH
therapy the atherogenic index (total cholesterol/HDL) decreased.49, Level
II-1; 53, Level II-2; 54, Level II
Growth hormone plays an important role in glucose and insulin
metabolism. The effect of rhGH therapy on serum insulin concentration
has been reported, showing a trend towards reduced insulin sensitivity
with a compensatory hyperinsulinaemic response without any untoward
effects on glucose metabolism.49, Level II-1; 48, Level II-1
Body composition improves with rhGH therapy in children with GHD.
Abnormal lipid proﬁles and atherogenic index improves with rhGH
therapy.
c.
Bone health
Studies had reported decreased levels of bone remodelling
markers in children with GH deﬁency prior to their treatment with
rhGH.55,Level II-2; 53, Level II-2 Bone formation and bone resorption markers
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
14
are reported to increase signiﬁcantly during rhGH therapy.53, Level II-2
Areal BMD (aBMD), which is dependent on age, height and weight, is
found to be low in GHD children.55, Level II-2; 53, Level II-2 Replacement rhGH
therapy in these children has shown signiﬁcant increase in aBMD and
volumetric BMD (vBMD).55, Level II-2; 53, Level II-2 The mean values of lumbar
aBMD and vBMD in treated patients with GHD at ﬁnal height did not
differ from normative data.56, Level II-1
Bone remodelling markers and bone mineral density increase with
rhGH therapy in GH deﬁcient children.
d. Cardiovascular effects
GHD
children
have
impaired
left
ventricular
(LV)
mass.57, Level II-;1 49, Level II-1 In a few prospective case-control studies,
the LV mass index was signiﬁcantly lower in GHD children than in
controls and it increased signiﬁcantly after one year of GH
replacement.49, Level II-1; 58, Level II-3 In another prospective case control
study, GHD children at baseline had normal global systolic function
with subtle LV dysfunction. One year of GH treatment was associated
with a signiﬁcant improvement of cardiac size and myocardial
contractility.57, Level II-1
GHD children have impaired LV mass and subtle LV dysfunction. rhGH
therapy normalises cardiac mass and function. However the clinical
signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings remains unclear.
e.
Quality of life (QoL)
The most obvious effect of GH is in regards to height and it has been
suggested that the impact of GH on QoL relates solely to the inﬂuence
of height. However, analysis of social parameters does not reveal
any impairment in self-esteem, mood and well-being in short
children.59, Level III Similarly, there was no direct relationship between QoL
and short stature resulting from Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure,
GH deﬁciency or idiopathic short stature when QoL was measured
by the time trade off method and the Nottingham Health Proﬁle
(NHP).60, Level II-1
In a small cohort study, patients with acquired GH deﬁciency had QoL
signiﬁcantly below population norms which improved with treatment,
whereas the subgroup with idiopathic GH deﬁciency did not show
signiﬁcant changes.61, Level II-2
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
15
In a larger cohort study it was demonstrated that after rhGH therapy,
behavioural scores signiﬁcantly improved in patients with GH deﬁciency
and ISS. Improvement was noted in the internalising subscales
(withdrawn, somatic complications and anxiety/depression) and
inattention, social problems and thought problems.62, Level II-2
Behavioural scores partially improved in GHD children with rhGH therapy.
2.2.5 Safety
a.
Malignancy
rhGH is both anabolic and mitogenic whilst IGF-1 is antiapoptotic. There
is much experimental data to suggest that GH treatment acting via local
tissue might enhance tumour cell growth. There are concerns that GH
treatment may cause new malignancy (de-novo), tumour recurrence or
second malignancy in those already treated for one tumour.
•
New malignancy
Based on the data from the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS)
in the United States and Canada, it was shown that the incidence of
leukaemia in rhGH-treated patients without risk factors for leukaemia
was comparable to that in the general population of age-matched
children.63, Level II-3 Similarly in Japan, the incidence of leukaemia
in rhGH-treated patients without risk factor is no greater than in the
general population aged 0-15 years.64, Level II-3
•
Recurrent malignancy
Data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) showed that
the relative risk (RR) of disease recurrence (ﬁrst recurrence) was
0.83 for rhGH-treated survivors compared with those not treated with
rhGH.47, Level II-3 The NCGS data (n=1262 children with brain tumour)
demonstrated an overall recurrence rate of 6.6% over 6,115 patient-years
follow up.65, Level II-3 GH outcomes from KIGS (Pﬁzer International Growth
Database with more than 50,000 patients treated with rhGH) noted that
the frequency of recurrence was 11.7% for craniopharyngiomas, 4.7%
for medulloblastomas, 8.8% for ependymomas, 4.0% for germinomas
and 9.8% for astrocytomas/gliomas.66, Level II-3
In a case-control study of patients with craniopharyngioma, there was
no evidence that rhGH replacement was associated with an increased
risk of tumour recurrence; 12.5% treated with rhGH developed tumour
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
16
recurrence compared to 41.5% of those with no treatment.67, Level II-2
In a study that analysed cases of medullablastoma, there was no
association between the use of rhGH and progression-free survival in
infants or older children.68, Level II-3
•
Second malignancy
The CCSS also showed the RR of a secondary neoplasm for rhGHtreated survivors compared with those not treated with rhGH was 3.21.
The overall increase was driven by a small excess number of second
neoplasms in the subgroup of acute leukaemia survivors (RR= 4.98).
This increase is of concern but the data needs to be interpreted with
caution given the small number of events.47, Level II-3 The elevation of risk
due to rhGH use appears to diminish with increasing length of follow
up.69, Level II-3
All above reported studies have signiﬁcant limitations. However, a
RCT cannot be performed due to ethical concerns. With some data
suggesting a possible increase in new cancers in patients treated with
rhGH, there is a need for continued surveillance.
There is no evidence that leukemia (de novo or relapse) or CNS tumour
recurrence is increased with rhGH therapy.
There is insufﬁcient evidence with regards to risk of secondary
neoplasms with rhGH therapy.
b. Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH)
BIH has been recognised as an early complication of rhGH.70, Level II-3 It
has been reported in GH deﬁciency but also in other conditions treated
with rhGH including chronic renal insufﬁciency (CRI), Turner syndrome
(TS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), glucocorticoids usage and delayed
puberty. Children receiving rhGH for CRI are more likely to develop
BIH.71, Level II-3
Based on a national database of rhGH-treated children in Australia
and New Zealand, the incidence of BIH was low i.e. 1.2 per 1,000
cases.72, Level II-3
The KIGS database showed that BIH occurred in 41 children resulting
in a total incidence of 27.7 per 100,000 treatment-years. The incidence
was signiﬁcantly lower in patients with idiopathic GH deﬁciency than
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
17
in those with TS (p=0.0004), congenital GH deﬁciency (p=0.0064),
PWS (p=0.0263) and CRI (p<0.001). No cases of BIH were reported in
the idiopathic short stature (ISS) group of patients. The median
duration from onset of GH therapy to BIH ranged from 0.01 to 1.3
years.73, Level II-3
BIH is known to occur in patients on rhGH therapy.
c.
Bone health
Different studies reported different prevalence of scoliosis. The
NCGS database (n=24,000) reported fewer than 1% of the patients
had scoliosis (prevalence of scoliosis in the general population was
between 1.5 to 3.0%).63, Level II-3 In a retrospective study (n= 250) of
children treated with rhGH, 4% developed scoliosis.74, Level II-3 A cohort
study (OZGROW) showed that TS girls receiving rhGH therapy have a
high prevalence of scoliosis (28%).75, Level II-2
The International Cooperative Growth Study (ICGS) demonstrated that
Perthes’ disease developed in 12 boys (69.9 per 100,000 patient-years).
Neither recurrence nor aggravation of Perthes’ disease was observed
during the rhGH therapy.76, Level II-3
In the ICGS database, slipped capital femoral epiphyses (SCFE)
developed in four cases with GHD and other pituitary hormones
deﬁciency during GH therapy (21.5 per 100,000 patient years). Two of
the patients had radiation therapy and 2 were obese. No aggravation of
SCFE was observed during the rhGH therapy.76, Level II-3
Data from NCGS showed that SCFE was signiﬁcantly less common
in children with ISS compared with GH deﬁciency on rhGH therapy.
71, Level II-3 The KIGS database reported an incidence of 73.4 per
100,000 treatment-years of SCFE. The incidence was signiﬁcantly
lower in patients with IGHD (18.3 per 100,000 treatment-years) and
ISS (14.5 per 100,000 treatment-years) than TS (84.5 per 100,000
treatment-years), cranial tumours (86.1 per 100,000 treatment-years)
and craniopharyngioma groups (120.5 per 100,000 treatment-years).
No cases of SCFE were reported in the SGA and PWS groups. The
median duration from onset of GH therapy to SCFE ranged from 0.4 to
2.5 years.73, Level II-2
There is insufﬁcient evidence to suggest a causal relationship between
rhGH therapy and scoliosis. However the prevalence of scoliosis is high
in TS girls.
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
18
Children with organic causes of GH deﬁciency on rhGH therapy have
an increase frequency of slipped capital femoral epiphyses.
d.
Glucose metabolism
A study evaluated the impact of rhGH therapy on glucose metabolism
in children and young adults with idiopathic GH deﬁciency and
showed no signiﬁcant change after one year of rhGH therapy
(0.024 mg/kg/day).77, Level III In another study, rhGH therapy in GHD
children did not lead to an impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or T2DM,
although it signiﬁcantly decreased insulin sensitivity.78, Level II-1
The NCGS reported that the majority of patients who developed
diabetes mellitus during rhGH therapy had an identiﬁable risk factor.
The incidence of permanent diabetes in others is similar to that
reported in American adolescents.71, Level II-3 In contrast, the KIGS
database demonstrated an increased frequency of T2DM in children
and adolescents receiving rhGH. Of the 43 who were conﬁrmed to have
glucose disorders, 11 had type 1 diabetes (T1DM), 18 had T2DM and
14 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). There was no increase in the
incidence for T1DM but the incidence for T2DM (34 cases per 100,000
patient-years) was approximately six-fold higher than in children not
treated with rhGH.50, Level II-3
rhGH therapy decreases insulin sensitivity without impairing glucose
tolerance.
The risk of T2DM may be increased in individuals on rhGH therapy.
e.
Skin
There are concerns that rhGH may cause skin cancer in preexisting pigmented naevi. The NCGS database reported 13 cases of
increase in pigmented naevi during rhGH therapy.71, Level II-3 However,
biopsies have not detected neoplasia or pre-malignant naevi
transformations.63, Level II-3 Studies have shown that there were
no difference in the naevi count between the children with GH
deﬁciency and control group despite many years of rhGH therapy.
However, children with TS had more naevi, but there was no
relation to the duration of rhGH therapy and frequency of skin
cancer.79 , Level II-2; 80, Level II-2; 81, Level II-2

There was no increase in melanocytic naevi or risk of skin cancer in
GHD patient on rhGH therapy.
Melanocytic naevi were more common in TS but there were no increased
frequency of skin cancer with rhGH therapy.
Other side effects are relatively rare. These include acute pancreatitis,
gynaecomastia,
oedema,

USE OF GROWTH HORMONE IN NON-GHD CHILDREN
3.1 TURNER SYNDROME
Turner Syndrome (TS) is a genetic disorder due to abnormalities of
the X chromosome resulting in an array of genetic, developmental,
endocrine,
cardiovascular,
psychosocial
and
reproductive
issues.82, Level II-2 It affects approximately one in every 2,500 liveborn
females. Majority of these patients have extreme short stature, gonadal
dysgenesis and hypogonadism with a normal intellectual performance
and language abilities. However, visual-spatial and/or visual-perceptual
abilities are impaired. The average height of untreated women with
TS is 143 cm and is approximately 20 cm below the TH.83, Level II-1
However, they are able to reach normal adult height with high doses of
rhGH.84, Level II-3
3.1.1 Outcome of rhGH Therapy
a.
Final height
In a recent Cochrane Systematic Review, it was shown that
rhGH was effective in improving growth and FH in girls with TS.
85, Level I; 86, Level II-1 The FH was 148 cm (1.4 ± 1.0 SD Turner chart) and
141 cm (0.2 ± 0.9 SD Turner chart) in the treated and untreated women
respectively.86, Level II-1
Factors affecting height gain [from start of rhGH therapy to attainment
of near-adult-height (NAH)] include:87, Level III
• Mid-parental-height
• Height at start of rhGH
• Index of responsiveness during ﬁrst year on rhGH
• Mean dose of rhGH per week
• Age at start of puberty
• Age at start of rhGH
• Duration of rhGH therapy
• Birth weight
b.
Cognitive function and psychological adjustment
The same Cochrane Review showed the possibility that girls treated
with rhGH have a better psychological adjustment than untreated
girls.85, Level I However, there were no demonstrable effects on cognitive
function, visual-spatial and/or visual-perceptual abilities.88, Level III
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
21
c.
Bone/body composition
rhGH therapy had little effect on cortical or trabecular BMD in girls with
TS. However, rhGH therapy was associated with an increase in lean
body mass and reduced adiposity.89, Level II-2
3.1.2 Time to start rhGH
rhGH therapy should be considered as soon as falling height percentile
is demonstrated in the linear growth of the child with TS and the
decision to start rhGH is best directed by a paediatric endocrinologist.
90, Level III; 9, Level III
3.1.3 Dose
rhGH doses range from 0.045 to 0.055 mg/kg/day. The current practice
is to administer subcutaneous injection of rhGH 6 or 7 days per week.
85, Level I
3.1.4 Oestrogen Therapy
Timing of introduction of oestrogen replacement is an important
determinant of FH in rhGH-treated TS patients. Oestrogen replacement
should not be started before the age of 12 years.85, Level I TS patients
in whom oestrogen was delayed until 15 years of age gained an
average of 8.4 ± 4.3 cm over the projected FH whereas those who
started oestrogen at 12 years old gained only 5.1 ± 3.6 cm. This
study concluded that the duration of rhGH therapy before oestrogen
replacement was a strong factor in predicting height gain.91, Level II-2
However, the timing of oestrogen replacement should also take into
consideration the importance of age appropriate pubertal maturation,
bone health and psychosocial stress of delayed sexual maturation.
90, Level III; 92, II-3; 93, Level III; 84, Level II-3 The dose of oestrogen should be
increased gradually over a duration of two to three years to achieve
pubertal maturation at a normal pace. The starting dose of conjugated
oestrogen (premarin) should be at 0.3 mg every other day or 5 mcg
ethinyl oestradiol daily. The dose should be increased gradually every
12 months to premarin 0.625 mg daily or ethinyl oestradiol 20 mcg daily
when medroxyprogestrone acetate (provera) 5 mg daily for 12 days will
be introduced to initiate cyclical uterine bleeding.93, Level III
3.1.5 Duration of Treatment
rhGH therapy may be continued until a satisfactory height has been
attained or until the bone age is 14 years or near FH is attained.90, Level
III; 9, Level III
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
22
3.1.6 Monitoring
Patients should be monitored as any other patients on GH therapy. IGF1 should be monitored to ensure value within ± 2 SD.90, Level III
3.1.7 Adverse Reactions of rhGH Therapy
Long-term surveillance showed that adverse effects are rare, but can
be serious. Girls with TS on rhGH therapy were at increased risk for
diabetes mellitus, SCFE, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, oedema,
lymphoedema or scoliosis.85, Level I The Genentech Drug Safety
Department received 117 serious adverse events out of 5,220 patients
on rhGH therapy where seven deaths were reported (ﬁve from aortic
dissection/rupture) and 10 new-onset malignancies including six in
patients without known risk factors.94, Level II-2 However, rhGH therapy
does not seem to affect the diameter of ascending or descending
aorta.90, Level III
Recommendation
Turner syndrome with short stature should be considered for rhGH
therapy and be referred early to a paediatric endocrinologist. (Grade A)
Oestrogen replacement therapy in TS children should not be initiated
before the age of 12 years. (Grade A)
3.2 SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE
Small for gestational age (SGA) is deﬁned as birth weight and/or birth
length of ≥2 SD below the mean for gestational age. Approximately
between 2.3 and 10% of all infants are born SGA. Most SGA infants
achieve appropriate catch-up growth by two years of age. However,
approximately 15% do not catch-up and continue to experience poor
growth throughout childhood.95, Level III Catch-up growth is considered
to have been achieved when the child’s height is at or above -2 SD for
age.96, Level III
3.2.1 Outcome of rhGH Therapy
a.
Final height
After adjustment for gender and TH, SGA subjects were signiﬁcantly
shorter (men 4.5 cm shorter and women 3.9 cm shorter) than those
with a normal birth weight at age 20 years.97, Level II-1 It was shown that
when rhGH therapy (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) was commenced at 8
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
23
years of age and continued for 7 - 8 years, adult height increased by ≥1
SD.98, Level III rhGH therapy resulted in an adult height above -2 SDS in
85% of the children after a mean treatment period of 7.8 years. There
is no signiﬁcant difference in height gain between the low dose rhGH
group (0.033 mg/kg/day) and the high dose rhGH group (0.067 mg/kg/
day).99, Level II-1
b.
Cognitive function and psychological adjustment
There is inconclusive evidence that rhGH improves IQ in short SGA
children. Long-term outcome data for children born SGA show no
difference in frequency of employment, marital status or satisfaction with
life. However, these individuals hold fewer professional or managerial
jobs and have signiﬁcantly lower income than individuals of normal size
at birth.98, Level III
c.
Body composition
rhGH therapy in short children born SGA was shown to improve body
composition, blood pressure and lipid metabolism.95, Level III; 97, Level II-1 In
a 6-year multicentre RCT, normalisation of BMI was not accompanied
by overall changes in percentage body fat but was accompanied by an
increase in muscle mass. The long-term clinical signiﬁcance of these
changes is uncertain.100, Level II-1
d.
Bone Mineral Density
Bone maturation increases proportionately to height gain with rhGH
therapy. Mean values of bone mineral apparent density (BMAD)
(-0.6 SDS) were signiﬁcantly reduced at start but normalised (0.3 SDS)
during rhGH therapy.101, Level II-1
e.
Cardiovascular risk
Children born SGA have an inherent risk of cardiovascular disease
and dyslipidaemia in later life. A 4-year study of children born SGA
treated with rhGH showed that those who had elevated systolic blood
pressure before treatment had a reduction in blood pressure over
time.100, Level II-1 A six-year RCT demonstrated that total cholesterol and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) decreased signiﬁcantly by the
end of the study.99, Level II-1
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
24
3.2.2 Time To Start
Early intervention with rhGH can be considered for short (height
below -2.5 SD) SGA children without a catch-up growth. With
reference to normal population standards, 44% of infants had
caught-up at three months of age, 51% at three years, 66% at
four years and 73% at six years.102, Level II-3 In most published
studies, rhGH therapy was initiated after ﬁve years of age.103, Level III
The European Agency for the Evaluation for Medicinal Products
(EMEA) approved rhGH use to treat growth retardation in short SGA
children (birth weight and/or birth length below -2 SD) with:104, Level III
• Height SDS <-2.5 and parental-adjusted height SD <-1.0
• Absence of catch-up growth (HV <0 SD during the last one year)
• Age of start of treatment >4 years
• Recommended GH dose is 0.035 mg/kg/day
3.2.3 Safety and Adverse Reactions
Adverse events are not more common in this population than in other
conditions treated with rhGH, nor have additional safety concerns
arisen.105, Level III; 95 , Level III; 106, Level III; 100, Level II-1
a.
Insulin resistance
There is no evidence that T2DM, IGT or dyslipidaemia occurs more
commonly among children born SGA than in the normal childhood
population. Although children born SGA tend to develop higher fasting
insulin level and relative insulin resistance during rhGH therapy, these
changes appear to be largely reversible when treatment is terminated.
105, Level III; 95, Level III; 106 , Level III; 100, Level II-1
b.
Bone age acceleration
Hokken-Koelega and colleagues showed that rhGH therapy is
associated with an acceleration of bone maturation especially in the
ﬁrst two years regardless of the rhGH dose given.101, Level II-1
c.
Risk of malignancy
There is no evidence that the risk of malignancy is increased with rhGH
therapy.105 , Level III, 95, Level III; 106, Level III, 100, Level II-1
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults

d.
Benign intracranial hypertension
As in other children treated with rhGH, BIH is a rare complication of
rhGH therapy in children born SGA, occurring in approximately 1 in
1000 individuals.105, Level III; 95, Level III; Lee 106, Level III; 100, Level II-1
e.
Other concerns
It is currently unknown whether rhGH therapy for SGA subjects
through childhood and adolescence is associated with future beneﬁts
or ampliﬁcation of metabolic risks in adult life. There is no long-term
surveillance data on adults who have been treated with rhGH for short
stature due to SGA. It is therefore prudent to follow up this group
systematically.105, Level III; 95, Level III; 106, Level III; 100, Level II-1
Recommendation
SGA children who remained short (<3rd percentile) after 4 years of age
should be referred to a paediatric endocrinologist for evaluation and
consideration of rhGH therapy. (Grade C)
3.3 IDIOPATHIC SHORT STATURE
Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is used to describe children who are very
short for their age for unknown reason. Precise estimates for incidence
and prevalence of ISS are difﬁcult to obtain. A systematic review
showed that 5 - 9% of the shortest 3% of the population did not reach
an adult height above -2 SD. This accounts for 0.2% of the normal
children population.107, Level 1
3.3.1 Outcome Of rhGH Therapy
a.
Final height
In a systematic review by Bryant J et al, a study reported that ISS
patients treated with rhGH for 6 months to 6.2 years showed that nearﬁnal-height in girls were 7.5 cm taller than untreated controls (mean
height of 155.3 ± 6.4 cm and 147.8 ±2.6 cm for GH-treated and control
group respectively). Another study reported an adult height of 3.7
cm taller in the GH-treated group compared with the control. Other
studies suggested that short-term height gain can range from none to
approximately 0.7 SD over one year.107, Level 1 FH measurements were
within the normal adult height range for 94% of patients who received
rhGH at a dose of 0.37 mg/kg/week (0.053 mg/kg/day).108, Level I Lee et
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
26
al. estimated that the potential cost of rhGH therapy is around USD
52,000 per 2.54 cm gain in height.107, Level 1
b.
Quality of life (QoL)
There was a signiﬁcant improvement in QoL in rhGH-treated ISS children
compared with the control, while no signiﬁcant impact on psychological
adaptation or self-perception was found.107, Level 1
c.
Psychosocial Functioning
Children with ISS were perceived to have psychosocial distress due to
their short stature. Visser-van BH et al. showed that rhGH therapy did
not improve psychosocial functioning.109, Level II-3 There was no difference
in the psychosocial variables between the rhGH-treated and untreated
subjects. Compared with the Dutch population norms, psychological
and social functioning in ISS children was normal.110, Level II-2
3.3.2 Dose
rhGH doses range from 0.30 to 0.37 mg/kg/week (0.043 - 0.053 mg/
kg/day). The mean overall height gain (ﬁnal height minus baseline
predicted height) was 7.2 cm and 5.4 cm for 0.053 mg/kg/day and 0.034
mg/kg/day rhGH dose groups respectively. No dose effects on safety
parameters were noted. The dose of 0.053 mg/kg/day rhGH was found
to be effective to achieve normal adult height in 94% of patients.108, Level I
In patients with ISS, rhGH dose at 0.053 mg/kg/day did not appear
to accelerate pubertal onset, pace, or bone maturation compared with
rhGH dose at 0.034 mg/kg/day.111, Level III; 112 006, Level II-2;
3.3.3 Adverse Reactions
No serious adverse effects of treatment were reported in a Cochrane
Systematic Review 2007. A GH registry on ISS patients reported a
safety proﬁle similar to GHD patients.113, Level II-3
Recommendation
rhGH should not be routinely prescribed in ISS patients for the following
reasons:
• inconsistent height gain with rhGH therapy
• high dose requirement (cost issues)
• absence of psychological and social malfunctioning in ISS without
therapy (Grade C)
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults

3.4 FAMILIAL/ GENETIC SHORT STATURE
Familial short stature (FSS) is a condition characterised by height
below the 3rd percentile for age, normal growth velocity, family history
of short stature in one or both parents and normal physical examination
(including body proportion). These children have normal bone age
(appropriate for chronological age), normal puberty and their expected
adult height is below the 3rd percentile but within the TH range (MPH
± 10 cm).
3.4.1 Outcome of rhGH Therapy
rhGH therapy has not been proven to improve remarkably FH of children
with FSS. A small RCT using two different doses (20 or 40 IU/m2/week
equivalent to 0.031 or 0.063 mg/kg/day) of rhGH in FSS showed no
difference in their adult height outcome. The incremental effect of both
doses on stature was minimal.114, Level II-3
Recommendation
rhGH should not be used in familial/genetic short stature. (Grade C)
3.5 CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY
Growth retardation in chronic renal insufﬁciency (CRI) is inﬂuenced
by factors such as nutritional insufﬁciency, endocrine and metabolic
alteration, glucocorticoid and other immunosuppressive therapy.
Despite adequate renal replacement therapy, growth retardation may
persist. Studies have shown that rhGH therapy in supraphysiological
doses may improve the growth velocity of these children signiﬁcantly.
However the cost of therapy is very high.
3.5.1 Outcome of rhGH Therapy
Renal failure is a state of growth hormone resistance and not growth
hormone deﬁciency. The FH of CRI patients treated with rhGH improved
by 0.5 - 1.7 SDS in 15 RCTs, whereas the control group lost by 0.5
SDS in comparable time interval. When a higher dose (0.05mg/kg/day)
was used, the resulting height velocity in the ﬁrst year was 3.8 cm/year
above the untreated patient. The growth response to rhGH therapy
is negatively correlated with age, height at start of rhGH therapy and
duration of dialysis.115, Level I The highest treatment success is obtained
if treatment is started at an early age and with relatively well-preserved
residual renal function.116, Level III Although rhGH therapy has been used
in all stages of CRI, the AACE Guideline 2003 has not recommended
rhGH therapy for post-transplantation patients unless it is given as part
of a research study.9., Level III
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults

3.5.2 Adverse Reactions of rhGH Therapy
The frequency of reported side effects of rhGH in CRI patients was
similar to that of the control group. They were wheezing, acute rejection
in transplanted patients, deterioration in kidney function, raised fasting
glucose, papilloedema, glucose intolerance, granuloma formation, lymph
node swelling, claudication, hypertension and worsening of pre-existing
idiopathic scoliosis. Three trials reported no signiﬁcant difference in
glucose intolerance in patients on rhGH therapy. Nine trials reported
that kidney function did not differ between the treated and untreated
groups. Only one trial demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in wheezing
in the rhGH group compared to the control group.115, Level I
Recommendation
In local setting, rhGH therapy should not be given to short children with
CRI. (Grade C)
3.6 PRADER-WILLI SYNDROME
Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) occurs in 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 16,000
live-born infants.117, Level III It is caused by paternal deletion or maternal
disomy of genes on the long arm of chromosome 15. Apart from short
stature and mental retardation, these children have excessive body
fat, decreased muscle mass, sleep disturbances and central apnoea.
118, Level II-1; 117, Level III
3.6.1 Outcome of rhGH Therapy
The body composition improved but did not normalise. Lean body
mass (LBM) improved at near-adult-height but remained low. Body fat
percentage and fat/lean ratio improved during the ﬁrst year of rhGH
therapy but returned to pretreatment state at near-adult-height. rhGH
intervention is likely to provide beneﬁts other than improvement of adult
height.118, Level II-1 In 2003, the European Union has approved rhGH for
improvement of linear growth and body composition in children with
PWS. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
indication for rhGH use limited to documented growth failure in PWS.
In a study by Lindgren et al, all patients reached near-adult height within
mid-parental height median -0.5 SDS (range -1.4 to 0.7) and 0.9 SDS
(range 0.1 to 1.9) for girls and boys, respectively.118, Level II-1
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults

3.6.2 Adverse Reactions
a.
Death during rhGH therapy
In a mini review of 13 mortality reports, 10 out of 13 PWS children died
of respiratory insufﬁciency. The highest risk of mortality occurred during
the ﬁrst 7 months of rhGH therapy.119, level III
b.
Respiratory
PWS children had an increased risk of central apnoea. However, six
months of rhGH therapy did not aggravate the sleep-related breathing
disorders in young PWS children.120, Level II-2
c.
Carbohydrate metabolism
Studies have shown that fasting insulin was signiﬁcantly increased at
12 months and returned to baseline between 24 and 36 months of rhGH
therapy. All PWS children receiving rhGH therapy had normal levels of
insulin, glucose, insulin to glucose ratio and HOMA-IR during the entire
study.120, Level II-2; 121, Level II-3
However, in the KIGS database (n= 22), one patient developed
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and another T2DM when their weights
increased rapidly over six months (gained >10 kg). In the patient with
IGT, glucose levels normalised after weight reduction.122, Level II-1
d.
Scoliosis
The prevalence of scoliosis in children with PWS is high (37.5%) and
increases with age.123, level II-3 However, the prevalence of scoliosis is
not higher in PWS patients receiving rhGH therapy.124, Level III; 125, Level II-2
Many children with scoliosis (13%) had undergone brace treatment or
surgery.123, level II-3
In local setting, PWS are generally very obese with high risk of central
apnoea at presentation. rhGH dose based on their body weight is likely
to be very high and hence very expensive.
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be given to children with PWS. (Grade C)

3.7 NOONAN SYNDROME
Noonan Syndrome (NS) is a multiple congenital abnormality syndrome
characterised by short stature, mental retardation, distinctive facial
appearance, congenital heart defects, thoracic deformities and
cryptorchidism. The incidence of NS is estimated to be between 1:1000
and 1:2500 live births. It is a hereditary autosomal dominant disorder
but 60% of the cases are sporadic. Mutation of PTPN11 gene accounts
for approximately 50% of all cases.126 , Level II-3; 127, Level II-3; 128, Level II-2
3.7.1 Outcome of rhGH Therapy
a.
Final height
FH gain was variable with rhGH therapy in Noonan patients. Some
rhGH-treated NS patients had no or only small increases in ﬁnal adult
height. The poor FH may be partly explained by PTPN11 gene mutation
which is associated with lower basal height and possibly poor response.
129, Level III
In the KIGS Database (n=402) of patients treated with rhGH therapy
for 4 to 12 years, the median increment in ﬁnal height was 0.6
SDS.127, Level II-3 In an uncontrolled study of 29 patients (22 patients
had PTPN11 mutation) using high dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day over 3.0 to
10.3 years, mean height gain was 1.3 SDS (range from +0.2 to +2.7).
126, Level II-3
3.7.2 Adverse Reactions
NS patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be at risk from rhGH
therapy because of the effect of rhGH on cardiac muscle mass. These
patients have generally been excluded from trials of rhGH therapy.
126, Level II-3; 128, Level II-2 Possible abnormal anabolic effects of rhGH on
myocardial thickness are not conﬁrmed, and none of the rhGH-treated
NS patients develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.128, Level II-2
In local setting, rhGH cannot be recommended for short children with
Noonan syndrome in view of the high dose and cost, a wide variation of
growth response and the uncertainty of rhGH on cardiovascular safety.
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be given to children with Noonan syndrome.

3.8 RUSSELL-SILVER SYNDROME
The incidence of Russell-Silver Syndrome (RSS) is 1:100,000 live
births. Key features of RSS include intrauterine cum postnatal growth
retardation, triangular facies and limb asymmetry. There is a tendency
for fasting hypoglycaemia in early childhood and genital dysmorphism
(cryptorchidism, hypospadias and hypogonadism).
3.8.1 Growth Response with GH Therapy
Recent data suggested that RSS exhibit abnormal pulsatility of
GH secretion. There were very few studies on RSS. In an earlier
review it was suggested that FH outcome can be improved by using
pharmacological doses of rhGH. However the number of RSS patients
was very small.130, Level III; 131, Level III Height gain (+1.3 SD) was the same
in SGA and RSS, but ﬁnal adult height is lower in RSS as they were
shorter at baseline.132, Level III
Recommendation
rhGH should not be given to children with Russell-Silver syndrome.
(Grade C)
3.9 SKELETAL DYSPLASIA
The incidence of skeletal dysplasia is at least 30 - 45 in every 100,000
newborn. Skeletal dysplasia comprises a large and heterogeneous group
of disorders affecting the development of the skeleton. Achondroplasia
(ACH) and hypochondroplasia (HCH) are the most common. ACH has
an estimated incidence of about 4 - 5 per 100,000.133, level III; 134, level II-3
ACH is characterized by short-limb dwarﬁsm, a relative macrocephaly
with prominent forehead, midfacial hypoplasia, lumbar lordosis and a
trident conﬁguration of hands and hydrocephalus.
In addition to prepubertal growth failure, ACH patient have decreased
pubertal growth spurt. The FH in untreated ACH is 131.5 and 125 cm
for boys and girls respectively.135, level III HCH is phenotypically milder
than ACH with a FH of 145.0 to 165.0 cm in untreated boys and 133.4
to 150.6 cm in untreated girls.134, level II-3
3.9.1 Goals of GH Treatment
First year response to rhGh therapy is typically a 2 - 3 cm increase
in growth velocity in prepubertal children with skeletal dysplasia, or a
height gain of 0.5 SDS or less from a baseline level of -4 to -5 SDS.
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
32
rhGH therapy for up to ﬁve years in ACH can produce a total height
gain of about 1 SDS. However, FH data is lacking. The body proportion
(trunk to leg length ratio) does not seem to be affected by rhGH therapy.
133, level III;
rhGH therapy is unlikely to improve the height of ACH to within normal
range for the population. On the contrary, rhGH therapy can worsen
scoliosis during pubertal growth and also the stature. Surgical limb
lengthening is a better alternative for these patients.135, level III
The height improvement was much greater in HCH than in ACH. With
three years of rhGH therapy, the mean increase in height SD for ACH
was negligible (-0.2 SD to 0.1 SD) but was better in HCH (1.2 SD to 2.6
SD).134, level II-3
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be used for skeletal dysplasia. (Grade C)

USE OF GROWTH HORMONE IN TRANSITION PATIENT
The primary goal of rhGH therapy in children is to achieve a ﬁnal height
(FH) which is consistent with the target height (TH). It is a common
practice to discontinue rhGH therapy after attainment of FH when
growth is completed. This period of adolescence after attainment of FH
until 6 to 7 years later (approximately from 17 to 25 years old) is termed
the transition period. This period encompasses a broad set of physical
and psychosocial changes.136, level III
The new goal of rhGH therapy in the transition period is normalisation
of metabolism and improvement in quality of life.
4.1
WHO SHOULD CONTINUE GH THERAPY?
It has been reported that 71.9% of childhood-onset growth hormone
deﬁcient (COGHD) children continue to be GHD in adult life and are
likely to require further rhGH therapy.137, level II-2 However, a substantial
proportion of children with isolated IGHD recover normal GH reserve
by the time FH is attained138, level II-1; 139, level II-3 especially in those who
were previously diagnosed to have partial GH deﬁciency.140, level II-3
Patients with MPHD, with or without structural pituitary or peri-pituitary
disease141, level II-3; 138, level II-1 and/or previous cranial radiation therapy
are more likely to have ongoing GHD.139, level II-3 Studies also found
that in the presence of two or more additional hormones deﬁciency
(≥3 pituitary hormones deﬁciency), all patients had a pathological GH
response during re-testing.142, level II-2; 138, level II-1 A prospective study on
adults with a history of either adult-onset hypothalamic-pituitary disease
or COGHD demonstrated that the positive predictive values (PPVs) for
GH deﬁciency in these subjects with three and four pituitary hormones
deﬁciency were 96% and 99% respectively.142, level II-2
In those who had been exposed to cranial irradiation (median dose
58 Gy) during childhood, it was demonstrated that 48% did not fulﬁll
the biochemical criteria (peak stimulated GH <3 mcg/L) for rhGH
replacement in adulthood.143; level II-2 It was also found that location of
the ectopic posterior pituitary at the median eminence and absence of
a visible stalk on MRI were predictors of severe GHD. However, only
61% of patients with COGHD and the above abnormal MRI ﬁndings
remain severely GHD in adulthood. All of those with associated MPHD
continued to have severe GHD in adulthood.141, level II-3; 144, level II-2
The AACE 2009 guidelines recommend that all patients with COGHD
should be re-evaluated using a GH stimulation test at completion of

growth except those with organic causes of hypothalamic-pituitary
disease, presence of at least three pituitary hormones deﬁciency and
serum IGF-1 below the given laboratory reference range of <-2 SD.
Repeat screening for GH deﬁciency should be performed by paediatric
endocrinologists at least one to three months after cessation of rhGH
therapy.145 , level III
Recommendation
All patients with COGHD should be re-tested at completion of growth
EXCEPT for those with:
• organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease
AND
• ≥3 pituitary hormone deﬁciencies
AND
• serum IGF-1 below –2 SD (Grade C)
4.2
RE-TESTING OF GHD PATIENTS
There are scarce data regarding the optimal pharmacologic agent for
GH stimulation test in the transition period. The functional dynamics
of GH secretion are different in growing children and in those who
have reached FH, leading to different deﬁnitions of GHD in children
and in young adults. The committees from various established
consensus guidelines have recommended ITT as the standard
test to re-evaluate GH reserve in adolescents during the transition
period.145, level III; 146, Level III; 136, level III, 42, level III A mean peak GH response
to ITT in those with high probability of permanent GH deﬁciency was
signiﬁcantly lower compared to controls.147, Level II-2
A Consensus Statement (2007) has recommended a peak stimulated
GH cut-off of less than 6 mcg/L for the diagnosis of permanent GH
deﬁciency in young adults with COGHD.146, Level III However, the
accuracy of ITT was recently evaluated and the best diagnostic
accuracy was found to be 5.62 mcg/L or less.148, level II-1 The glucagon
test has been shown to be as good as the ITT in assessing GH
reserve in hypopituitary adults.149, level II-2; 150, level II-2 A case-control
study demonstrated that glucagon test reliably identiﬁed patients with
GH deﬁciency using a cut-off peak stimulated GH of 3 mcg/L with a
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 97% and 88% respectively.149, level II-2 It was
also demonstrated that serum IGF-1 in a patient who has discontinued
rhGH treatment may be helpful in identifying persistent GH deﬁciency.
However, serum IGF-1 may not fall below normal levels until six
months after rhGH therapy is discontinued.144, level II-3 Various studies
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
35
showed different IGF-1 cut-off points for persistent GH deﬁciency
i.e. -1.7 SDS147, level II-2, <-2 SDS 137, level II-2 and ≤-2.83 SDS.148, level II-1
Insulin tolerance test (ITT) is the preferred stimulatory test to re-assess
patients with COGHD during the transition period.
A peak stimulated GH value of 5.6 mcg/L or less in response to ITT has
the best accuracy for diagnosing permanent GH deﬁciency.
Glucagon test is a good alternative to ITT.
Recommendation
ITT should be used to re-test COGHD patients during transition period.
(Grade B)
4.3
DOSE OF GH
In a large RCT of young adults with GH deﬁciency randomised to rhGH
doses of 25 mcg/kg/day (paediatric dose), 12.5 mcg/kg/day (adult dose)
or no GH treatment, there were no treatment differences between the
two rhGH doses but there was signiﬁcant improvement when compared
to the control in body composition in the rhGH arms compared to the
placebo arm. This study also suggested that dose requirements may
have to be adjusted for gender, as females requiring a higher dose to
normalise IGF-1 than males.151, level 1
Using the same cohort of patients to study the effect of rhGH therapy
on bone, it was shown that there were no signiﬁcant changes in bone
turnover markers, bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD between the 2
rhGH doses but signiﬁcant improvement as compared with the control.
However, this study favoured the lower paediatric dose for bone mass
accumulation as the higher paediatric dose in GHD young adults causes
a predominant bone resorption over bone formation.152, level 1
In an earlier smaller RCT, comparing outcomes of two years treatment
with rhGH (12.5 or 25.0 mcg/kg/d) and placebo, the LBM and FM
changed from baseline to the end point exhibited a signiﬁcant dose
dependency. Improvement in LBM, FM and spine BMD was signiﬁcantly
better with the higher dose.153, level 1
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) 2009
guidelines recommend that the starting dose of rhGH in transition
should be approximately 50% of the dose between the paediatric dose
required for growth and the adult dose.145, level III
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
36
Recommendation
The starting dose of rhGH that should be given during transition period
is 0.0125 - 0.0250 mg/kg/day. (Grade C)
The dose of rhGH should be adjusted to maintain normal serum IGF-1
level. (Grade A)
4.4
BENEFITS OF TREATMENT
Studies had shown improvement in body composition and lipid proﬁles
in young adults but not muscle strength with rhGH therapy during
the transition period.Caroll 154 PV et al 2004, level II-2; Hulthen 155 L et al 2001, level II-2,
Vahl 156 N et al 2000, level I; Johannsson 157 G et al 1999, level II-2 rhGH treatment in GHD
adolescents did not show any effect in terms of cardiac mass and
function.Lanes 158 R et al 2001, level II-2
As for QoL in COGHD patients, results showed that overall baseline
QoL was not compromised in severely GHD patients during the
transition period but dimensions related to age-speciﬁc psychological
problems were signiﬁcantly worse than healthy subjects and appeared
to positively respond to rhGH therapy.159, level 1
In a large RCT, it was shown that there was an increase in total BMD
in the rhGH-treated versus the untreated GHD adolescents after two
years.152, level 1 Similarly, in a large multicentre RCT, results showed
that there was a signiﬁcant improvement in lumbar spine BMD in those
treated compared to the untreated.160, level 1 Another study documented
that areal bone mineral density (aBMD) continued to accrue in untreated
patients with GH deﬁciency after two years at a slightly but signiﬁcantly
lower rate than those treated.161, level 1
However, smaller studies did not demonstrate any beneﬁt to BMD, lipid
metabolism, body composition, cardiac function, muscle strength and
QoL with rhGH therapy during the transition period.162, level II-2; 163, level I
Many studies have shown an improvement in body composition, lipid
proﬁle, bone mineral density and QoL in rhGH-treated GHD adolescents
during transition period.

GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY IN ADULTS
5.1
CLINICAL FEATURES OF ADULT WITH GH DEFICIENCY
SYNDROME
Adults with GH deﬁciency present with a wide spectrum of clinical
presentation and is termed as GH deﬁciency syndrome. However the
features are not pathognomonic and may overlap with a variety of other
conditions.
Table 1: Clinical Features of Syndrome of Adult GH Deﬁciency
Symptoms
Signs
• Increased body fat
• Reduced muscle bulk
• Reduce strength and physical
ﬁtness
• Reduced sweating
• Impaired psychological
well-being
• Depressed mood
• Anxiety
• Reduced physical stamina
• Reduced vitality and energy
• Increased social isolation
* Adopted from Ho K 2006. Growth Hormone deﬁciency in Adults.
Endocrinology 2006. 5th edition; 755-765.
Untreated GH deﬁciency in adults is associated with increased
morbidity and mortality.164, level II-2; 165, level II-2 The syndrome is associated
with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality, osteopenia, fracture
rates, fat mass and decreased muscle mass. There is also a
greater propensity for dyslipidaemia with increased total and LDL
cholesterol, and reduced HDL cholesterol.145, level III Successful rhGH
replacement treatment ameliorates many symptoms of GH deﬁciency
syndrome.166, level III GHD adults are associated with reduced bone
density and osteoporosis. COGHD results in reduced bone density in
adult life.167, level II-2 and subjects with adult onset GH deﬁciency have an
increased prevalence of fractures.168, level II-2 The KIMS database of GHD
adult showed that the majority (60 - 70%) of patients had additional
pituitary hormones deﬁciency primarily gonadotropin, TSH and ACTH
deﬁciency. Posterior pituitary deﬁciency was less common (22%).169 ,level II-3

Recommendation
Regular monitoring of the cardiovascular parameters including lipid
proﬁles, blood pressure and fasting glucose should be done. (Grade C)
GHD adults should:
• be regularly monitored for the cardiovascular parameters including
lipid proﬁles, blood pressure and fasting glucose (Grade C)
• undergo DEXA scan (Grade C)
• be screened for other pituitary hormone deﬁencies and if present,
be optimally treated as well (Grade A)
5.2
AETIOLOGY
A large number of different aetiologies contribute to GH deﬁciency in
adulthood. Frequent causes include previous hypothalamic–pituitary
disease, such as pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, cranial
irradiation, head trauma/vascular injury and inﬁltrative disease.
COGHD also contributes to growth deﬁciency in adulthood. Idiopathic
GH deﬁciency may also occur in some cases.
The KIMS global surveillance database of adult GHD patients showed
that the most common causes of GH deﬁciency were pituitary adenoma,
idiopathic GH deﬁciency and craniopharyngiomas which collectively
contributed to 60 - 70% of all cases.170, level II-3; 169 G, level II-3 Other causes of
GHD adults include non-pituitary brain tumours and irradiation (7.0%),
traumatic brain injury/TBI (3.1%), postpartum pituitary necrosis (2.9%)
and lymphocytic hypophysitis (0.9%).
GH deﬁciency has also been found to occur in one third of patients who have
undergone cranial irradiation for non-pituitary brain tumours171, Level III
and two-thirds of patients with childhood onset acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia (ALL).172, level II-2
At least 25% of TBI survivors developed one or more pituitary hormone
deﬁciencies. Most cases of post-traumatic hypopituitarism remain
undiagnosed and untreated in clinical practice. In a recent systematic
review, up to one third of TBI patients were diagnosed to have GH
deﬁciency. In the majority of patients, the condition was transient and
only 16% of the cases had persistent deﬁciency at 6 - 12 months of
follow up.173, level I It was recommended that screening for GH deﬁciency
is appropriate 6 to 12 months after the head trauma in moderate to
severe head cases.174, level III
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
39
Recommendation
GH deﬁciency should be excluded in adult patients with clinical features
of GH deﬁciency AND one of the following:
• hypothalamic-pituitary disease,
• previous cranial irradiation
• traumatic brain injury (Grade B)
In the absence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease, screening for GH
deﬁciency is not recommended in adults. (Grade C)
5.3
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of GH deﬁciency in adults should ideally be based on
correct identiﬁcation of clinical features in individuals at risk of GH
deﬁciency and biochemical conﬁrmation. The diagnosis of GHD is
conﬁrmed by performing stimulation tests. Commonly used tests are
ITT, glucagon stimulation test, arginine with/without growth hormone
releasing hormone (GHRH) (ARG plus GHRH) test. Comparison of
these different diagnostic tests has shown that the ITT and ARG plus
GHRH tests were better to differentiate between GHD patient from
normal persons.175, level III In the KIMS global database of adult GHD,
these two stimulation tests were the most commonly used.169, level II-3
However, GHRH is not available in Malaysia.
The cut off value to diagnose GH deﬁciency in adults is GH level that
is less than 5.1 mcg/l. This value will provide 96% sensitivity and
92% speciﬁcity. The GH assay used for this particular cut off is an
immunochemiluminometric assay.175, level III If a patient has three or four
pituitary hormone deﬁciencies in addition to a low IGF-1 level (below -2
SD), in the absence of conditions that lower IGF-1, the probability of GH
deﬁciency being documented on stimulation testing is more than 90%
and thus stimulation test is necessary to make the diagnosis.142, level II-3
In most circumstances, the biochemical diagnosis of GH deﬁciency in
an adult would require only one stimulation test.176, level III
ITT is contraindicated in patients with electrocardiographic evidence
or history of ischaemic heart disease or in patients with seizure
disorders.166, Level III Since ITT can cause seizures,177, level III it might be
prudent to avoid it in patients with a history of previous stroke as well. In
such patients where the ITT is undesirable or contraindicated, a reliable
alternative GH stimulation test is the glucagon stimulation test (GST) for
the following reasons: 1) accurate and reliable discrimination between
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
40
normal and true GH deﬁciency, 2) availability, 3) reproducibility, 4)
safety and 5) lack of inﬂuence by gender, or hypothalamic cause of
GHD.178; level III
Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT) is the gold standard for diagnosing adult
GH deﬁciency.
Recommendation
ITT should be avoided in patients with one or more of the following:
• History of seizures
• History of strokes
• Presence of coronary artery disease.
• >55 years of age (Grade C)
Glucagon stimulation test is an alternative in patients who are unsuitable
for ITT. (Grade C)
Patients with irreversible hypothalamic-pituitary lesions and with
evidence of at least three pituitary hormone deﬁciencies and serum
IGF-1 levels below the age- and sex-appropriate reference range
are deemed GH deﬁcient and do not require GH stimulation
test. (Grade C)
5.4 BENEFITS
There are protean clinical manifestations of GH deﬁcient syndrome
for which the appropriate management is GH replacement. However,
not all subjects with GH deﬁciency has the GHD syndrome.176, level III
The beneﬁts of GH replacement are well documented and many of
the metabolic and body composition improvement may have a positive
impact on the cardiovascular risk that GH deﬁcient adult. The indications
and the positive impact are discussed in the sections below.
Recommendation
rhGH should only be prescribed to patients with clinical features
suggestive of adult GH deﬁciency AND biochemically proven GH
deﬁciency. (Grade C)
5.4.1 Psychological well- being
Patients with GH deﬁciency have been shown to have a reduced
sense of well-being. The majority of studies showed that adults with
hypopituitarism of both childhood and adult onset have a diminished
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
41
QoL in comparison with the normal population. Reductions in physical
and mental energy, dissatisfaction with body image and poor memory
have been reported most consistently.179, level I; 180, level II-3; 181, level III
GH replacement in GHD adults has improved QoL, especially in the
domain of energy level, self-esteem, attention and memory. There is
considerable social impact with fewer days of sick leave.179, level I; 182,
level III; 180, level II-3; 183, level II-I; 184, level II-2; 181, level III
Both generic and GHD-speciﬁc tests usually indicate that rhGH
replacement therapy enhances QoL. Quantitative indices of QoL are
increased within 1 - 3 months in most patients, although some individuals
require longer treatment duration (6 months) before improvements are
noted.182, level III Some patients show deﬁnite beneﬁt after receiving rhGH
therapy but in others improvements were either limited or none. The
degree of improvement in QoL is generally proportional to the deviation
from normality at the outset but shows no correlation with the degree of
improvement in IGF-1 levels in practice. If the QoL of the patients is normal
at baseline, no improvement will be seen with rhGH therapy.181, level III
Methods for assessing the QoL in adult with GH deﬁciency:
• Generic Questionnaires such as Nottingham Health Proﬁle,
Psychological General Health Well-being Schedule and General
Health Questionnaire
• Disease-Speciﬁc Questionnaire such as Quality of Life-Adult with
GH deﬁciency Assessment, GH deﬁciency Questionnaire
Recommendation
A QoL questionnaire should be administered before beginning GH
replacement as psychological well-being is the most compelling
indication for GH replacement in adults with GH deﬁciency. (Grade C)
Adults with GH deﬁciency on GH replacement should be evaluated
using the QoL questionnaire at 6 to 12-monthly intervals to document
the effects of GH on their psychological well being. (Grade C)
5.4.2 Body Composition
There is a reduction of total body fat mass (FM) after rhGH
replacement
and

dependent 185, level III; 186, level II-2; 187, level II-I This FM reduction is accompanied
by a parallel increase in fat free mass (FFM) which follows the same
rhGH dose trend.185, level III The reduction in whole body FM with rhGH
replacement is due mainly to a marked decrease in central and

visceral fat in GHD subjects.185, level III; 188, level II; 186, level II-2; 189, level II-2; 190,
level II-1 rhGH replacement has been shown to have greater reduction in
central

as
compared
to

adipose
tissue.188, level III; 189, level II-2; 187, level II-1 These body composition changes
were more pronounced for young and lean subjects.185, level III The
increase in the FFM was reﬂected by an increase in muscle power
in these subjects.191, level III While the increase in FFM was seen within
a month of rhGH replacement, the increase in muscle strength was
only seen after 6 - 12 months of rhGH replacement. This lag in the
functional improvement may be due to initial improvement in muscle
tissue hydration.185, level III
Recommendation
GHD adults who are undergoing rhGH replacement should have their
body composition such as BMI and waist circumference measured
regularly. (Grade C)
5.4.3 Cardiovascular Risk
Patients with GH deﬁciency have been shown to have an increased
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is also an associated
increase in cardiovascular risk markers similar to that observed in
Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS) namely, central obesity, elevated
triglyceride (TG) and reduced HDL cholesterol levels.192, level I; 185, level III
Higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension has also been reported
in GHD adults.193, level II-2; 194, level II-2 Furthermore, doppler ultrasound
measurement has shown an increased carotid intima-media thickness
(IMT) in GHD adults indicating the presence of atherosclerosis.184, level II-3
Replacement with rhGH in GHD adults has shown a reduction in fat
mass particularly in centrally distributed fat mass. There is also an
improvement in lipid level with a reduction in the total cholesterol and
LDL cholesterol levels.192, level I; 180, level II-3; 185, level III The effects of GH
replacement on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance is highly
dependent on the dose of rhGH used and the susceptibility of the
patient to develop diabetes such as underlying obesity, family history
of diabetes and previous history of gestational diabetes. It is therefore
important that susceptible patients to diabetes mellitus are given a very
low dose of rhGH at initiation of therapy (i.e. 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day) and
that the dose then is slowly increased based on the clinical response
as there may be an initial deterioration of insulin sensitivity with rhGH
replacement in the ﬁrst three months but insulin sensitivity returns to
baseline levels with longer duration of rhGH replacement.185, level III In a
study on a group of leaner (BMI: 22.8) and younger (age:29.5) COGHD
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
43
adults, an improvement of insulin sensitivity was seen.195, level II-2
Longer term studies of ﬁve years duration have also demonstrated a
signiﬁcant reduction in IMT suggesting a reversal of the atherosclerotic
process.196, level II-2; 184, level II-3 However, no data is available yet to show a
reduction of cardiovascular events or mortality as the number of GHD
adults on sufﬁcient long duration of GH replacement is still relatively
small.
Recommendation
GHD adults who are undergoing GH replacement should have their
cardiovascular parameters monitored, in addition to body composition
measurements. (Grade C)
5.4.4 Bone Density
Adults with GH deﬁciency are associated with reduced bone density
and osteoporosis. COGHD results in reduced bone density in adult life
167, level II-I and subjects with adult onset GH deﬁciency have an increased
prevalence of fractures.168, level II-I
There are studies showing that treating GHD adults with rhGH
replacement improved BMD as assessed by dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry scan (DEXA scan) which is more pronounced in males
and in those with lower initial BMD.191, level III; 194, Level II-2
Recommendation
GHD adults should undergo DEXA scan prior to starting GH replacement.
(Grade B)
• If the initial bone density is abnormal, repeat DEXA scan is
recommended at 1 - 3 years intervals to assess the need for
additional anti-osteoporosis treatment. (Grade C)
5.5 DOSAGE
The rhGH dosage should be individualised, independent of body weight
and increased slowly to the minimal dose that normalises serum IGFI level without untoward side effects. In older patients, lower starting
dose should be used for replacement.145, level I; 197, level I; 198, level II-I
The dose of rhGH is initiated at 0.1 - 0.2 mg daily for men and 0.2
- 0.3 mg daily for women. At each visit, the rhGH dose is increased by
0.1 to 0.2 mg until the maintenance dose is reached based on clinical
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
44
response, IGF-1 levels and limited by the occurrence of side effects.
199, level III
Recommendation
rhGH dose for replacement in GHD adults should be individualised
independent of body weight. (Grade A)
The starting dose of rhGH is 0.1 mg daily for men and 0.2 mg daily
for women. The dose is increased by 0.1 mg or 0.2 mg to achieve a
maintenance dose based on clinical response, IGF-1 levels, and side
effects. (Grade C)
5.6 SAFETY
5.6.1 Common Adverse Effects
In short term RCTs, the most common reported adverse events
related to rhGH therapy were oedema, arthralgia and muscle
weakness.197, level I; 200, level I Similarly, a three-year RCT reported that
adverse events related to ﬂuid retention are fairly common which include
arthralgia (30.6%), myalgia (13.5%), peripheral oedema (12.6%),
paresthesia (9.0%), carpal tunnel syndrome (7.2%), generalised
oedema (7.2%) and hypoaesthesia (5.4%). These events were not
associated with increase in IGF-1 levels.201, level I Data from the KIMS
Pﬁzer International Metabolic Database reported that 18% of patients
developed ﬂuid retention.202,level II-3
Fluid-related adverse effects such as arthralgia, myalgia and peripheral
oedema are common in rhGH replacement therapy.
5.6.2 Risk of Tumour Recurrence
Three observational studies had shown that rhGH replacement therapy
had no signiﬁcant effect on tumour regrowth.203, level II-2; 204, level II-2; 205, level II-2
In a long-term study by Arnold et al. involving 130 patients with
non-functioning pituitary adenoma treated by surgical removal,
rhGH treatment was not a signiﬁcant independent predictor of
recurrence.203, level II-2
rhGH in GHD adults does not increase recurrence of hypothalamicpituitary tumours.
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
45
5.6.3 Risk of New Malignant Disease
A prospective longitudinal study of rhGH therapy in hypopituitary males
of more than 50 years old demonstrated no change in serum prostate
speciﬁc antigen (PSA).206, level II-2 The KIMs database also showed no
evidence of rhGH therapy increasing the risk of developing malignant
neoplasms.202,level II-3
When comparing 1, 411 hypopituitary adults without rhGH replacement
(mean age of 56.9 year) and 289 hypopituitary patients on long-term
GH replacement (mean age of 47.6 year and mean duration of GH
treatment of 60 months) with the normal population, malignancies were
increased in those hypopituitary patients without rhGH replacement.
However in patients on rhGH replacement, the overall mortality and the
rate of malignancies were similar to the normal population.207, level II-2
rhGH replacement in GHD adults does not increase the risk of new
malignant tumours.

USE OF GH IN NON-GHD ADULTS
6.1 BURNS PATIENTS
Three RCT conducted in Shriners Hospitals for Children of Texas on the
use of low dose rhGH (0.05 mg/kg body weight) in 178 severely burned
children (Total Body Surface Area Burn >40%, age below 18 years)
showed that rhGH signiﬁcantly increased body composition (Height,
Bone Mineral Content, Lean Body Mass and weight); cardiac function
in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (12% ± 24 vs
1% ± 20). Strength measurements showed signiﬁcant improvement
at 12 months. The number of reconstructive procedures from hospital
discharge to the end of the study period was signiﬁcantly lower in the
rhGH group compared to the placebo group (1.8 ± 1.3 vs 4.1 ± 2.5).
208, level I Data is still limited for the use of rhGH therapy in children with
burns.
There is no retrievable evidence regarding the usefulness of rhGH
therapy in burns in adult patients.
Recommendation
rhGH therapy for burns in children should only be limited to research
purposes. (Grade B)
rhGH therapy should not be used for burns in adults. (Grade C)
6.2 CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS
Two RCT clearly demonstrated that the administration of high doses of
rhGH therapy to critically ill patients receiving prolonged intensive care
was associated with increased morbidity and mortality.209, level I
However, two smaller studies using short-term, low-dose rhGH
in surgical patients showed protein sparing beneﬁts of rhGH
supplementation with no major adverse effects apart from
hyperglycaemia.210, level I; 211, level I
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be used in critical illness. (Grade A)
6.3 FIBROMYALGIA
A narrative review of 26 papers suggested that pituitary function was
normal in ﬁbromyalgia patients. The therapeutic efﬁcacy of supplemental
The Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults
47
rhGH therapy in ﬁbromyalgia requires further study before any further
recommendations can be made.212, level III
In a small non-placebo RCT using rhGH as concomitant treatment in
severe ﬁbromyalgia associated with low IGF-1 levels, the therapy group
showed a 60% reduction in the mean number of tender points compared
to the control group (3.25 ± 0.8 vs 8.25 ± 0.9). Similar improvements
were observed in FIQ score and EQ-VAS scale. The ﬁndings suggested
that there may be an advantage of using rhGH therapy in a subset of
severe ﬁbromyalgia patients with low IGF-1 serum levels.213, level I Further
randomised placebo-controlled studies would be useful to evaluate the
place of rhGH therapy in ﬁbromyalgia.
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be used for routine treatment of ﬁbromyalgia.
It may be considered in patients with low IGF-1 levels. (Grade A)
6.4 ANTI-AGEING THERAPY IN HEALTHY ELDERLY
There are physiological changes in GH levels with age. The safety,
efﬁcacy and role of rhGH in healthy elderly individual’s remains
controversial and the use of rhGH therapy as an anti-ageing agent
in Europe and United States has not been approved. Published
literature evaluating rhGH therapy and ageing in the healthy elderly are
limited. Studies have generally been non-randomised, small, of short
duration and using only limited surrogate parameters such as body
composition.
Liu H et al. 2007 published a systematic review which included 31 articles
involving a total of 220 participants. rhGH therapy was associated with
small changes in body composition with a reduction in overall fat mass
(-2.10 kg, 95% CI -2.80 to -1.35) and an increase in lean body mass
(2.10 kg, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.90). rhGH therapy had no signiﬁcant effect
on other outcomes such as serum lipid levels or bone density. There
was no evidence to show that the effects of GH on body composition
resulted in a change in muscle strength, maximal oxygen uptake during
exercise or an improvement in function. Study participants were elderly
with a mean age of 69 ± 6 years and overweight (mean body index 28
± 2 kg/m2). Treatment dose (mean 14 ± 7 mcg per kg body weight) and
duration (mean 27 ± 16 weeks) were varied. There was an increased
rate of adverse events, with rhGH-treated subjects being more likely to
experience oedema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, gynaecomastia
as well as an increased risk of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose.

48
A recent systematic review also showed no deﬁnite evidence that rhGH
therapy beneﬁted elderly non-GHD individuals.215, level II-2 There is no
data available to suggest that rhGH therapy beneﬁts cognition in the
healthy adult population.
Recommendation
rhGH should not be used as an anti-ageing therapy. (Grade A)
6.5 SPORTS
Exogenous rhGH therapy has been touted as an athletic performance
enhancer for many years and its use for such a purpose has been
banned by professional sports regulatory authorities.
Liu H et al., in 2008, published a systematic review of 44 articles on the
effects of GH on athletic performance. Overall, 303 subjects received
rhGH therapy. They were young (mean age of 27 ± 3 years), lean (mean
BMI of 24 ± 2 kg/m2) and physically ﬁt (mean maximum oxygen uptake
of 51 ± 8 ml/kg/minute). GH dosage varied (mean dose of 36 ± 21 mcg/
kg/day) as did treatment duration (mean of 20 ± 18 days). The review
found that although exogenous GH was associated with an increase
in lean body mass (mean of 2.1 kg, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.9), there was no
signiﬁcant improvement in actual strength and exercise capacity. In
fact, two out of three studies that measured exercising lactate levels
showed signiﬁcantly higher exercising lactate levels in rhGH-treated
subjects suggesting that GH therapy may worsen exercise capacity.
rhGH treated subjects were more frequently experiencing adverse
events such as soft tissue oedema and fatigue compared to those not
treated with GH.216, level I
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be used to enhance athletic performance.
(Grade A)
6.6 INFERTILITY
There are no studies that have looked at the use of rhGH alone in
infertile women with normal pituitary function. Most evidence has looked
at rhGH as an adjunct to other treatments for infertility.
A Cochrane systematic review of nine RCT by Harper K et al in 2003
speciﬁcally looked at the use of rhGH therapy to improve outcomes of
in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) in women. This review found no evidence that

49
routine addition of GH to IVF increased the livebirth rate. It also showed
an improvement only in those who had previously responded poorly to
IVF (OR=4.37, 95% CI 1.06 to 18.01).217, level I
The other systematic review looked at various therapeutic options
available for women who had previously responded poorly to IVF. Five of
the six studies using rhGH therapy showed no signiﬁcant improvement
in measures of fertility (such as serum oestradiol, duration of follicular
phase, number of oocytes and pregnancy rate). The single study
which favoured the addition of GH was small and used historical
controls.218, level II-I
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be used in the treatment of infertile women
with normal pituitary function. (Grade B)
6.7 OBESITY
It is known that the endogenous secretion of GH in obese individuals
is decreased although the exact physiological role of GH in obesity is
unclear.
A recent meta-analysis of 24 RCTs looked at the efﬁcacy and safety
of rhGH therapy in simple adult obesity (i.e. not associated with
distinct clinical syndromes). Treatment with very high dosages of rhGH
therapy led to very small improvement in waist-hip ratio and fat mass in
subjects treated with rhGH therapy compared to placebo. There were
no signiﬁcant differences in body weight, BMI, subcutaneous fat area,
resting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient and blood pressure.
However, there were signiﬁcant increase in adverse events associated
with rhGH therapy including arthralgia, paraesthesias and oedema. The
beneﬁcial effects appear to be quantitatively small and would not justify
a clinically relevant role for rhGH therapy in obesity.219, level I
Recommendation
rhGH therapy should not be used in the treatment of simple adult
obesity. (Grade A)
