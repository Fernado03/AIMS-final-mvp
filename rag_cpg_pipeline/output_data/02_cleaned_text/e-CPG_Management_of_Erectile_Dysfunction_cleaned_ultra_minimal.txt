STATEMENT OF INTENT
This clinical practice guidelines (CPG) is meant to be a guide for
clinical practice based on the best available evidence at the time of
development. The guideline should not override the responsibility of
the practitioners to make decision appropriate to the circumstances of
the individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and
their families or guardians, taking into account the management options
available locally.
UPDATING THE CPG
These guidelines were issued in 2024 and will be reviewed in a minimum
period of four years (2028) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When
it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of
the related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done
on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A
multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review
methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken
to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of
publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections
will be published in the web version of this document, which is the
deﬁnitive version at all times. This version can be found on the websites
mentioned above.

FORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION
• In line with the new development in CPG methodology, the
CPG Unit of MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations,
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) in its
work process. The quality of body of evidence and related effect
size are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG DG.
• Recommendations are formulated based on certainty of
evidence and the wording used denotes the strength of
recommendations. This takes into account:
 quality and level of the evidence
 balance of benefits and harms of the options
 patient’s preference and values
 resource implications
 relevancy and applicability to the local target population
• The more criteria being fulfilled, the more certain is the evidence
leading to strong recommendations using the word “should”
being considered. Otherwise, weak recommendations use the
word “may” in proposing an action to be made.
• In the CPG, a yellow box highlights important message(s) in
the management while a blue box contains evidence-based
recommendation(s) for the particular condition.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations are highlighted by the CPG DG as the
key recommendations that answer the main questions addressed in the
CPG and should be prioritised for implementation.
DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT
• A comprehensive medical, psychosocial and sexual history should
be taken in every patient presenting with erectile dysfunction (ED).
• A validated questionnaire related to ED should be used to assess
all sexual function domains (e.g. International Index of Erectile
Function).
• A focused physical examination in the initial assessment of men
with ED should be done to identify underlying medical conditions
and co-morbid genital disorders that may be associated with ED.
• Routine laboratory tests should be performed to identify modiﬁable
risk factors of ED.
• Patients with ED should have cardiac risk assessment and vice
versa.
TREATMENT
• All patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) should be advised on
lifestyle and risk factor modiﬁcations.
• Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor should be offered to all patients with
ED unless contraindicated.
• Mechanical devices (e.g. using vacuum erection device or
shockwave therapy) may be offered in ED. Low-intensity
extracorporeal shockwave therapy should be performed by
urologists for mild to moderate ED.
• Penile prothesis may be offered to patients with ED who have
failed other interventions.
• An integrated and collaborative approach with psychological
interventions should be considered in the treatment of ED.

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The members of the DG for this CPG were from the Ministry of Health
(MoH), the Ministry of Higher Education and the private sector. There
was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC)
during the process of the CPG development.
A systematic literature search was carried out using the following
electronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and others
e.g. PubMed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy).
The inclusion criteria are all adults at risk and with erectile dysfunction
(ED) regardless of study design. The ﬁrst search was limited to
literature published in the last 15 years (2007 until 2022) for all clinical
questions, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of
all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify
relevant studies. Experts in the ﬁeld were also contacted for studies
related to the issues addressed. All searches were conducted from 2
to 17 August 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical
questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any
relevant papers published before 9 January 2024 to be included. Future
CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date.
The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from
the CPG Secretariat.
References were also made to other guidelines on ED as listed below:
• American Urological Association (AUA) - Erectile Dysfunction: AUA
Guideline (2018)
• European Association of Urology (EAU) - EAU Guidelines on
Sexual and Reproductive Health (2023)
A total of 12 main clinical questions were developed under different
sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within
these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG
members met 21 times throughout the development of these guidelines.
All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using
the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence
tables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and
recommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the
DG and RC. Where evidence was insufﬁcient, the recommendations
were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion
are resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely on the ﬁndings
of systematic reviews/meta-analyses and clinical trials, with local
practices taken into consideration.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
iv
The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the U. S.
Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2015) while the
grading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE
as much as possible (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the
CPG followed strictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for
Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II.
Upon completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It
was also posted on the MoH Malaysia ofﬁcial website for feedback from
any interested parties. The draft was ﬁnally presented to the Technical
Advisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology Assessment
(HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and approval.
Details on the CPG development by MaHTAS can be obtained from the
Manual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based
Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at https://
www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/CPG_MANUAL_MAHTAS.pdf).

INTRODUCTION
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent and multifaceted medical
condition characterised by the persistent inability to achieve or
maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. As a
widespread health concern, ED substantially impacts the quality of life
of affected individuals and their partners, leading to emotional distress,
strained relationships and diminished overall well-being.1, level III
ED can manifest in various forms which can be due to organic,
psychogenic and mixed aetiologies.2 Organic ED may result
from vascular, neurogenic, hormonal or anatomical factors, while
psychogenic ED is often associated with psychosocial issues. Mixed
ED involves a combination of both organic and psychogenic factors,
making a comprehensive understanding of the condition crucial for
effective management.
The pathophysiology of ED is complex, involving intricate interplay
between vascular, neurologic, hormonal and psychological factors.
Vascular insufficiency, endothelial dysfunction and altered smooth
muscle tone are common contributors. Understanding these
mechanisms is essential for tailoring therapeutic interventions to the
specific needs of the patient.
In 1995, approximately 150 million men worldwide were estimated to be
affected by ED and this is likely to double by 2025.3, level III Throughout
Asia, there is variation in the prevalence rate of ED ranging between
2.0% and 81.8%.4, level III A local study at five government primary care
clinics in Petaling District showed that the prevalence of ED for males
aged 40 to 79 years old was 69.5%. It increased with age from 49.7%
of men in their 40s to 66.5%, 92.8% and 93.9% of men in their 50s, 60s
and 70s respectively.5, level III A recent study based on National Health
and Morbidity Survey 2019 data revealed a prevalence of moderate
to severe ED in men aged ≥18 years at 31.6% (95% CI 28.8 to
34.6).6, level III
The burden of ED extends beyond its physical manifestations, impacting
the mental and emotional well-being of individuals. It is associated with
co- morbidities e.g. diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) and depression. Moreover, ED is known to be an early marker
of systemic vascular dysfunction, emphasising the importance of timely
diagnosis and intervention.2
Clinical practices for the diagnosis and treatment of ED can vary
significantly, reflecting differences in healthcare systems, cultural
perceptions and access to resources. Recognising and addressing
these variations is crucial to ensure equitable and effective care for the
affected individuals.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
In conclusion, this CPG on Management of ED endeavours to provide
a systematic and culturally sensitive approach to the diagnosis and
treatment of ED. It is hoped that this CPG can help in optimising
resource utilisation by providing evidence-based recommendations
for efficient and safe management of ED. Eventually, this will lead to
standardised care, improved patient outcomes and reduced the burden
of ED on affected individuals, their partners and the healthcare system.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
2.
RISK FACTORS
There are various risk factors associated with ED e.g. age, lifestyle
behaviours, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, psychological and
hormonal risks. A person may have more than one risk factor at a time.
2.1
Age
In a local study on moderate to severe ED, all age groups of patients
above 18 years old and sexually active were substantially affected by
the condition. The prevalence was 32.7% in those 18 - 30 years old,
26.3% in 31 - 59 years old and 64.1% in ≥60 years old. Men aged ≥60
years were strongly associated with moderate-to-severe ED with an OR
of 3.04 (95% CI 2.27 to 4.10).6, level III
2.2
Lifestyle behaviours
a) Diet
In a meta-analysis on behaviour factors (including diet) in ED, fruit
and vegetable consumption revealed mixed results on the risk of
ED. Meanwhile, increased consumption of flavonoids reduced the
risk.7, level II-2
A prospective cohort study on the association between the
Mediterranean diet and ED reported highest category of Mediterranean
Diet Score was inversely associated with incidence of ED in those aged
<60 years (HR=0.78 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92) and 60 - 70 years (HR=0.82,
95% CI 0.76 to 0.89).8, level II-2
b) Physical activity
In males aged ≥20 years, a cross-sectional study showed physical
activity of at least moderate intensity was associated with lower odds
of ED compared with no physical activity in a week as demonstrated
below:9, level III
• 1 - 2 days/week (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.76)
• 3 - 4 days/week (OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.75)
• 5 - 7 days/week (OR=0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.64)
The benefits of physical activity was shown in another cross-sectional
study on diabetic patients where higher activity was inversely associated
with moderate-to-severe ED and severe ED (OR=0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to
0.85 and OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.73 respectively).10, level III
A cross-sectional study showed that higher cardiovascular (CV)
exercise levels (based on weekly metabolic equivalents time
[MET]-hours) in physically active men were inversely associated
with ED based on self-reported data of the respondents (p for
trend=0.03).11, level III
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
However, a meta-analysis of five cross-sectional studies showed that
cyclists had higher odds of having ED compared with non-cyclists
(OR=2.00, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.55). Quality assessment showed that the
primary studies were of fair to poor quality.12, level III
c) Obesity
A cross-sectional study in an andrology clinic showed that obese men
(body mass index [BMI] ≥29 kg/m2) had a higher risk of ED (OR=1.78,
95% CI 1.10 to 2.90) compared with those non-obese.13, level III
d) Smoking
A cross-sectional study among men showed that cigarette smoking
was an independent risk factor for ED (OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.81).
A dose-response was also exhibited (p=0.005).14, level III
e) Alcohol
In a meta-analysis of 24 cross-sectional studies, alcohol consumption
was not associated with ED. Further analysis showed that when
compared with non-drinkers, light to moderate consumption exhibited
a beneficial effect on the risk of ED (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86)
whereas high consumption did not. Heterogeneity in the analysis
was significant.15, level III There was no report on quality assessment of
primary papers.
f) Recreational drugs
A systematic review of behaviour factors in relation to ED showed
that users of recreational drugs (amphetamine, cannabis, opioid
and ecstasy) had an increased risk of ED compared with non-user.
According to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, the primary papers scored
moderate to high quality.7, level II-2
g) Pornography
A cross-sectional study on the association between problematic
pornography consumption and ED using an internet-based questionnaire
showed higher cyber pornography addiction test scores resulted in a
higher probability of ED by 1.06 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.08).16, level III
In another cross-sectional study, the analysis demonstrated that men
who preferred masturbation with pornography vs partnered sex without
pornography were at a significantly increased risk of having ED.17, level III
h) Partner’s sexual dysfunction
A meta-analysis was conducted to assess evidence on female sexual
dysfunction (FSD) and its impact on male partners. The findings based
on six cross-sectional studies revealed that the likelihood of ED is almost
four times higher when the female partner had FSD compared with men
who have partners without FSD (OR=3.80, 95% CI 1.96 to 7.38). Based
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
on McMaster Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies, the risk of
bias for the primary studies were scored 82 - 100%.18, level III
2.3
Co-morbidities
a) Diabetes mellitus
In a large meta-analysis on the prevalence of ED, the overall prevalence
among diabetic patients was 59.1% (95% CI 55.5 to 62.7) while the
odds of prevalence in diabetic patients vs healthy controls was 3.62
(95% CI 2.53 to 5.16).19, level III
b) Hypertension
In a meta-analysis of eight high-quality cross-sectional studies,
hypertension was a risk factor for ED based on the International Index
of Erectile Function (IIEF) (OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.00). However,
the heterogeneity of primary studies was high.20, level III
c) Cardiovascular diseases
A local cross-sectional study reported a prevalence of various severity
ED among patients with established ischaemic heart disease (IHD) at
90.4%. The mean age of patients was 60.5±9.58 years with two-thirds
of them having moderate to severe ED.21, level III
In another cross-sectional study, the prevalence of ED among patients
with post-myocardial infarction (MI) was 62%. Arterial hypertension
(CVD risk) was significantly associated with ED.22, level III
d) End-stage renal disease
In a meta-analysis on the prevalence of ED in patients with end-stage
renal disease (ESRD), the overall pooled prevalence was 71% (95% CI
67 to 74). Further subgroup analyses showed that pooled prevalence
among patients with ESRD pre-dialysis (82%) was the highest compared
with those who were on haemodialysis (79%), peritoneal dialysis (71%)
and renal transplant recipients (59%).23, level II-2
e) Hyperuricaemia
A meta-analysis demonstrated an association between hyperuricaemia
and risk of ED based on study design i.e.:24, level II-2
• five cohort studies (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.89)
• six cross-sectional studies (OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.65)
The same meta-analysis of three cohort studies also reported that
urate-lowering therapy reduced the risk among hyperuricaemic patients
(OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.41).
f) Obstructive sleep apnoea
A systematic review of observational studies assessed the association
between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and ED. It reported the
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
prevalence of ED among patients with OSA ranged from 40.9% to 80%.
There were mixed findings on the association between risk of ED and
OSA severity (using Apnea-Hypopnea Index), oxygen saturation <90%
during sleep or waketime sleepiness.25, level II-2
g) Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome
In a meta-analysis, a subgroup analysis based on observational
studies showed chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome had
a higher risk of ED compared with controls (OR=2.68, 95% CI 2.23 to
3.22).26, level II-2
h) Depression and anxiety
In a meta-analysis of three cohort studies, the odds of having ED
among depressed patients was 2.55 (95% CI 2.12 to 3.06) compared
with non-depressed patients.27, level II-2
A systematic review of anxiety disorders found that the median
prevalence of ED was 20.0% (IQR 5.1 to 41.2) based on IIEF-5,
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition
(DSM-IV) criteria and 17.6% (IQR 13.88 to 20.88) based on IIEF-5
alone.28, level III
i) Hypogonadism
In a cross-sectional study assessing the adverse health outcomes of
testicular cancer survivors post-chemotherapy, those with secondary
hypogonadism reported a higher risk of ED compared with those
without the condition (19.6% vs 11.9%, p=0.018).29, level III
j) Traumatic brain injuries
A cohort study on the association of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and
ED showed:30, level II-2
• incidence rate of ED was higher in the TBI group compared with
the non-TBI group (24.66 per 100,000 vs 19.07 per 100,000) after
a 10-year follow-up
• higher risk of ED for the TBI group after adjustment of confounding
factors (HR=2.569, 95% CI 1.890 to 3.492)
• higher severity of TBI increased the risk of ED (dose-dependent) -
 mild (HR=2.305, 95% CI 1.672 to 3.124)
 moderate (HR=2.551, 95% CI 1.884 to 3.331)
 severe (HR=5.467, 95% CI 2.452 to 7.706)
2.4
Medications
a) Antihypertensives
Thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers (β-blockers) are usually associated
with drug-induced ED.2
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
However, a network meta-analysis showed NS difference in
erectile function (EF) based on pairwise comparisons of all major
antihypertensive classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, calcium channel blocker and
thiazide diuretics) and also with placebo. Further analysis of different
β-blockers on EF demonstrated that:31, level I
• nebivolol had beneficial effect compared with non-vasodilatory
β-blockers (OR=2.92, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.5)
• NS difference between carvedilol and non-vasodilatory β-blockers
b) Statins
In a meta-analysis that consisted of three randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) on patients with established CVD or CVD risk factors, there was
no association found between statins and the incidence of ED.32, level I
c) Finasteride
A meta-analysis of nine RCTs on androgenetic alopecia showed an
increased risk of ED compared with placebo among patients who
were on finasteride 1 mg/day (OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.60) but no
association with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day.33, level I
A more recent meta-analysis showed that based on the safety profile,
there was an NS difference in the risk of developing ED between
finasteride and dutasteride.34, level I
Treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) includes 5-α-reductase
inhibitors which are among the associated risk factors for druginduced ED.2
d) Psychotropic agents
A large retrospective cohort study demonstrated that males with
serotogenic antidepressants were associated with increased risk for
ED compared with those without serotogenic antidepressants (OR=3.2,
95% CI 2.3 to 4.4).35, level II-2
Antidepressants (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
tricyclics) and antipsychotics are among the risk factors for druginduced ED.2

3.
DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT
Assessment and diagnosis of ED should always begin with a detailed
medical, sexual and psychological history of the patients and, when
available, their partners. The history should include information about
past and current sexual relationships, previous consultations and
treatments.
3.1
Medical History, Physical Examination and Laboratory
Testing
a) History
A detailed history aided by validated questionnaires, e.g. the 15-item
version of IIEF (IIEF-15), or its short version IIEF-5,36, level III help to
assess the different sexual function domains (i.e. sexual desire, EF,
orgasmic function, intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction),
as well as the potential impact of a specific treatment modality. In a
systematic review on the IIEF-15 and IIEF-5 measurement properties,
both had comparable sensitivity and specificity at different cut-off points
in evaluating ED.37, level III
Assessment of penile rigidity in practice and research can be supported
by the use of the Erectile Hardness Score (EHS). A validation study of
EHS showed that it had a fairly good correlation with IIEF in all domains
(ranging between 0.63 to 0.86) except the sexual desire domain.38, level III
The assessment of IIEF-5 and EHS helps to determine severity of ED,
hence guiding the physician in choosing the appropriate management.
Patients should always be screened for symptoms of possible
hypogonadism, including decreased energy and libido. Potential risk
factors for ED e.g. DM (refer to Chapter 2) should be screened for and
identified.
Refer to Appendix 3 for Relevant History-taking in Patients with
Symptoms of ED, Appendix 4 for 5-item Version of International
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and Appendix 5 for Erection
Hardness Score.
b) Physical examination
Patients should undergo physical examination focusing on the
genitourinary (including prostate), endocrine, vascular and neurological
systems. Blood pressure, heart rate and BMI or waist circumference
should be measured during clinical examination as part of cardiovascular
risk assessment.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
A physical examination may reveal penile abnormalities, e.g. Peyronie’s
disease, pre-malignant or malignant genital lesions, prostatic
enlargement and signs suggestive of hypogonadism (e.g. small testes
or alterations in secondary sexual characteristics).2
c) Laboratory testing
Laboratory testing must be tailored to the patient’s symptoms and risk
factors. The tests are performed to identify and treat any modifiable risk
factors. Fasting blood glucose or haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) and lipid
profile should be performed as part of the CV risk assessment.2
Additional laboratory tests may be considered on a case-to-case basis
e.g. hormonal tests which include early morning total testosterone, total
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prolactin and luteinizing hormone.2
d) Advanced work-up
Most patients with ED can be managed based on their medical and
sexual history; conversely, some patients may need specific diagnostic
tests as discussed below.
i.
Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity test
The nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR) device has to be
worn by the patient overnight for at least two separate nights and gives
the following information:
• number of erectile episodes
• tumescence (circumference change by strain gauges)
• maximal penile rigidity
• duration of nocturnal erections
An erectile event lasting ≥10 minutes and with at least 60% stiffness
observed on the tip of the penis is indicative of a functional erectile
mechanism. NPTR monitoring can help to differentiate between organic
and psychogenic ED objectively; patients with psychogenic ED usually
have normal findings. However, its routine use in the diagnosis of ED
may be limited due to potential confounding factors (e.g. dreams) which
may affect nocturnal erection.2
ii. Intracavernous injection test
The intracavernous injection test is performed with or without dynamic
duplex Doppler ultrasound. The ultrasonography can help confirm
potential vasculogenic aetiology of ED. Peak systolic blood flow >30
cm/s, end-diastolic velocity <3 cm/s and resistance index >0.8 are
considered normal.2
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
iii. Arteriography
Patients who are being considered for penile revascularisation should
have penile pudendal arteriography. For patients with ED and isolated
penile artery stenosis, computed tomography angiography is advocated
prior to penile artery angioplasty.2
The specific diagnostic tests for ED listed above are indicated for the
following conditions:2
• primary ED (not caused by acquired organic disease or
psychogenic disorder)
• young patients with a history of pelvic or perineal trauma suspected
to have vasculogenic ED
• patients with penile deformities that might require surgical
correction (e.g. Peyronie’s disease and congenital penile
curvature)
• patients with complex endocrine disorders
• patients with complex psychiatric or psychosexual disorders
• medico-legal reasons [e.g. implantation of penile prosthesis (PP)
to document end-stage ED and sexual abuse]
3.2
Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
• ED could be the initial manifestation of a spectrum of clinical
conditions that eventually lead to coronary artery disease (CAD) and
peripheral vascular disease.
• The prevalence of ED is >70% among men with CVD.39, level III
A cohort study on patients with ED showed:40, level II-2
• severe ED predicted major adverse cardiac event (MACE) with
HR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.78)
• lower penile blood flow before and after prostaglandin-E1
stimulation was associated with an increased risk of MACE -
 in flaccid conditions (peak systolic velocity [PSV] <13 cm/s),
the HR was 2.67 (95% CI 1.42 to 5.04)
 in dynamic conditions (PSV <25 cm/s), the HR was 1.57 (95%
CI 1.01 to 2.47)
A meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that ED was associated
with risk of:41, level II-2
• coronary heart disease (RR=1.46, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.63)
• stroke (RR=1.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.54)
• all-cause mortality (RR=1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.34)
The above analysis showed NS heterogeneity. However, there was no
report on the quality assessment of primary studies.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
A cross-sectional study on three different CV risk engines among
patients referred for sexual dysfunction showed that the AUC was 0.762,
0.716 and 0.667 for Progetto Cuore, Framingham and Prospective
Cardiovascular Münster (PROCAM) engines respectively.42, level III
Patients with predominantly vasculogenic ED are suggested to be
assessed using 2019 American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk score based on
recommendation by Princeton IV consensus guidelines. It provides
estimation of patients with major CV events within the next 10 years and
can be accessed online via https://tools.acc.org/ascvd-risk-estimatorplus/#!/calculate/estimate/. Depending on ASCVD score, patients may
require for further cardiologist assessment.43
European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines 2023 categorise the
cardiac risk stratification among patients with ED based on the 2nd
and 3rd Princeton Consensus. The characteristics and management for
each risk are as follows (Table 1).2; 44

3.3
Psychological and Sexual Assessment
Psychosocial and sexual history is important for thorough and
comprehensive assessment. These can be assessed through clinical
interviews and objective measurements on specific areas of history
which include:2; 46
• current psychological state and co-morbid psychiatry conditions
(e.g. anxiety, depression)
• relationship history - issues, dynamics, durations and partner
history
• partner’s sexual functioning (e.g. FSD)
• life stressors and coping abilities
• cognitive factors -
 dysfunctional thinking style
 expectations on sexuality and sexual performance, and
treatment preferences
• sexual related factors -
 education
 trauma
 experience (e.g. masturbation, pornography usage)
 cultural and religious aspects
 gender dysphoria and sexual orientation

Management of Erectile Dysfunction
Recommendation 1
• A comprehensive medical, psychosocial and sexual history should
be taken in every patient presenting with erectile dysfunction (ED).
• A validated questionnaire related to ED should be used to assess all
sexual function domains (e.g. International Index of Erectile
Function).
• A focused physical examination in the initial assessment of men with
ED should be done to identify underlying medical conditions and comorbid genital disorders that may be associated with ED.
• Routine laboratory tests should be performed to identify modifiable
risk factors of ED.
• Specific diagnostic tests may be performed when it is indicated*.
• Patients with ED should have cardiac risk assessment and vice
versa.
*Refer to preceding text in Subchapter 3.1 (d).
Management of Erectile Dysfunction

TREATMENT
ED can be treated with multiple therapeutic options. These include
lifestyle modifications, pharmacological agents, mechanical devices,
surgeries and psychological interventions. It should be a dynamic
process resulting in a patient-centred treatment strategy that depends
on the effectiveness, safety and cost of the treatment. In this context,
shared decision-making (preferably with a partner) is essential
throughout the management of ED.
4.1
Lifestyle Intervention
ED is strongly associated with lifestyle risk factors. Addressing these
factors is important in the treatment of ED.
A systematic review of patients with ED ± treatment of ED showed
that modifications of CV risk factors which included physical activity,
Mediterranean diet and weight loss improved IIEF-5 score compared
with those not receiving the interventions (MD=2.40, 95% CI 1.19 to
3.61). Overall, the studies had moderate to good methodological
quality.47, level I
Another systematic review of 10 clinical trials demonstrated that
aerobic exercise of moderate-vigorous intensity (≥3 times/week for ≥30
minutes/ session) improved IIEF or IIEF-5 for men with arterial ED due
to physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and/or
CVD compared with controls. In general, the risk of bias for each study
was estimated to be moderate.48, level I
Weight loss regimen which included low-energy diet and physical
exercises among overweight or obese man improved EF (MD of
IIEF score=1.99, 95% 0.85 to 3.13) based on a meta-analysis of five
moderate-to-high quality RCTs.49, level I In relation to weight loss, a prepost study on ED patients with obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m2 or ≥35 kg/m2
with other co-morbidities), bariatric surgery significantly improved their
EF based on IIEF scores.50, level II-3
The male pelvic floor muscles have three major functions i.e. to support
the abdominal content, coordinate contraction with sphincters for faeces
and urine elimination, and to facilitate the erection and ejaculatory
processes. A systematic review among patients with ED on pelvic floor
muscle training under therapist supervision in 5 - 20 sessions for 3 -
4 months showed 35 - 47% of cure in ED from baseline. The mean
methodological quality of the trials was 70% based on Crowe Critical
Appraisal Tool score.51, level II-3
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
Another pre-post study on smoking cessation showed that quit smoking
significantly improved ED irrespective of pack-years of smoking and
severity of ED.52, level II-3
In a recent pre-post study on patients with alcohol use disorder and
ED, IIEF-5 scores improved after three months of abstinence from
alcohol (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that age, alcoholic liver
disease and number of standard drinks per day were associated with
the improvement of ED.53, level II-2
A cross-sectional study found significantly higher perceived stress in
patients with ED than healthy controls.54, level III In managing stress,
counselling is helpful as an initial step to provide support and guidance
regarding ED.
Psychotherapy, on the other hand, goes one step further and is directed
towards gaining insights into chronic and recurrent emotional and
cognitive patterns, and their contribution to ED (refer to Subchapter
4.5).55, level III
EAU Guidelines 2023 recommends to modify risk factors and commence
lifestyle changes prior to or concurrently with ED treatments.2
Recommendation 2
• All patients with erectile dysfunction should be advised on lifestyle
and risk factor modifications.
4.2
Pharmacological Treatment
The main pharmacological agents for ED are phosphodiesterase-5
inhibitors (PDE5is). These agents cause corporeal smooth muscle
relaxation, increased arterial blood flow and compression of sub-tunical
venous plexus leading to erection. Therefore, they are contraindicated
in patients taking nitric oxide (NO) donors, organic nitrates or organic
nitrites (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate). As they are not initiators of erection,
PDE5is require environmental and psychological cues for sufficient
sexual arousal and stimulation to facilitate an erection. The U. S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PDE5is will be discussed
below. Refer to Appendix 6 for Pharmacological Treatment in ED.
a) Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor
i.
Sildenafil
Sildenafil was the first available PDE5i in the market. The recommended
initial dose is 50 mg and may be adjusted according to its responses
and adverse events (AEs). The onset is 30 - 60 minutes and the effect
persists up to 12 hours after administration.2
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
In a pre-post study on ED patients with DM and/or hypertension
treated with flexible-dose sildenafil of 25 - 100 mg on-demand/
once daily, the medication significantly improved mean IIEF-5
score from 13.6±5.7 at baseline to 21.7±4.1 at week 12. Sildenafil
was generally safe and well-tolerated. The most common reported
AEs were headache (5.5%), flushing (1.9%) and nasal congestion
(1.3%).56, level II-3
A meta-analysis of RCTs on the effectiveness and tolerability of sildenafil
compared with placebo in patients with DM-associated ED showed that
sildenafil:57, level I
• improved IIEF-5 Question 3 score (WMD=1.14, 95% CI 0.73 to
1.50) and IIEF-5 Question 4 (WMD=1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.42)
• increased overall sexual performance satisfaction based on global
efficacy question (RR=3.99, 95% CI 2.58 to 6.18)
• led to more successful intercourse (RR=3.34, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.31)
with higher number of patients reporting at least one successful
attempt of intercourse in the last four weeks of treatment (RR=2.86,
95% CI 2.25 to 3.65)
The most common AEs reported were headache, dyspepsia and
flushing. Overall, the risk of bias of the primary studies was moderate
to high.
A large network meta-analysis on the effectiveness and safety of PDE5i
in ED showed that sildenafil at low doses (25 or 50 mg) followed by
tadalafil (10 or 20 mg) were the first therapeutic options for ED.58, level I
ii. Tadalafil
In a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/
BPH/ED, tadalafil 5 mg once daily was more effective than placebo in
terms of:59, level I
• IIEF score (SMD=5.18, 95% CI 4.13 to 6.23)
• Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP)2 score (OR=5.46, 95% CI 3.53 to
8.46)
• SEP3 score (OR= 4.14, 95% CI 3.11 to 5.50)
Tadalafil was well tolerated although the AEs were not specified. The
primary papers were of low risk of bias.
Two meta-analyses compared the effectiveness and safety of tadalafil
5 - 10 mg once-a-day and tadalafil 10 - 20 mg on-demand dosing
regimen in ED patients. In the first meta-analysis, the once-a-day
regimen improved IIEF-EF scores compared with on-demand at 12
weeks (WMD=1.82, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.80). A secondary sub-analysis on
four RCTs showed that tadalafil 5 mg once-a-day was more effective in
IIEF-EF than 20 mg on-demand at 12 weeks (WMD=1.51, 95% CI 0.49
to 2.53).60, level I However, the analysis showed NS differences in IIEFEF scores between the two regimens regardless of different end-point
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
of study duration.60 - 61, level I There was NS difference in AEs between
both groups.61, level I The quality of RCTs in both meta-analyses was
variable.
A large meta-analysis of RCTs compared the effectiveness and
safety of tadalafil vs sildenafil in the treatment of ED. The findings
showed:62, level I
• NS differences in means of IIEF (IIEF-EF, IIEF-intercourse
satisfaction, IIEF-overall satisfaction and IIEF-sexual desire)
• tadalafil had significantly better Self-Esteem and Relationship
(SEAR) Confidence, SEAR Sexual Relationship and Erectile
Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) total
scores
Although there was NS difference in overall AEs between the two
agents, tadalafil had significantly higher risk of myalgia and back pain,
and lower risk of flushing. Most of the studies scored two on the Jadad
score (low quality).
iii. Avanafil
Avanafil (100 mg and 200 mg) was compared with placebo in the metaanalysis of eight RCTs among patients with ED. It was more effective
in terms of:63, level I
• higher IIEF-EF score (MD=4.57, 95% CI 3.68 to 5.46)
• successful vaginal penetration (RR=3.20, 95% CI 2.60 to 3.95)
• successful intercourse (RR=2.53, 95% CI 2.19 to 2.92)
In a sub-group analysis, the 200 mg dose was significantly better than
100 mg in IIEF score and successful intercourse. For AEs, avanafil had
a higher risk compared with placebo (RR=1.78, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.31).
However, there was NS difference in AEs between the two doses of
avanafil. The methodological quality of primary studies was generally
high.
In a 12-weeks, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of
men with DM and ED, avanafil (100 and 200 mg) was more effective
than placebo in improving IIEF score and successful intercourse which
could be initiated in ≤15 minutes through >6 hours. The most commonly
reported AEs with avanafil were headache, nasopharyngitis, flushing
and sinus congestion.64, level I
iv. Vardenafil
The effectiveness of vardenafil vs placebo in ED was studied in a
meta-analysis of RCTs. The former was significantly more effective in
IIEF-overall satisfaction, SEP2 and SEP3 scores. No safety profile was
reported. The mean Jadad score was 3.54, indicating that all included
studies were of high quality.65, level I However, vardenafil is not registered
yet in Malaysia.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
• Patients with ED should stop PDE5i and seek immediate medical
care when there is a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes which
could be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy
(NAION).66, level III
• However, patients with a history of NAION may be prescribed PDE5i
with caution.
Recommendation 3
• Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor should be offered to all patients with
erectile dysfunction unless contraindicated.
 The choice of agent is individualised.
b) Combination therapy vs monotherapy
A meta-analysis showed that the combination of PDE5i with various
agents (mainly alpha-blocker, testosterone and antioxidants) was more
effective than PDE5i monotherapy in the subgroup of patients that have
ED (WMD in IIEF score=1.76, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.24). However, there
was NS difference in treatment-related AEs. GRADE gave a moderate
quality assessment of the outcomes. The heterogeneity of the primary
papers was significant.67, level I
On the treatment of ED, EAU Guidelines 2023 recommends PDE5is
as a first-line therapeutic option for the specific condition. The choice
of drug depends on the frequency of intercourse and the patient’s
personal experience.2
c) Other medications
•
Intracavernosal injection
Intracavernosal injections (ICIs) were the first medical treatment for
ED. The only FDA-approved preparation is alprostadil. There are
many combination preparations that include either one or more of the
following combinations of phentolamine, papaverine or atropine but
none have obtained FDA approval, making standardisation of dosing
difficult. Apart from that, patients and their partners need to learn the
injection technique under supervision by trained medical personnel.
In a cohort study of Korean ED patients who received ICI at least twice,
adequate penile rigidity was restored in 60.2% of patients. AEs occurred
in 25.5% of patients which were due to:68, level II-2
• pain during self-injection (45.9%), longer erections than expected
(23.0%), penile curvature (14.9%), palpable plaque (10.8%) and
subcutaneous haematoma (5.4%) in the withdrawal group
• prolonged erection (44.4%) as the most common AE in the
continuing group
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
There was no incidence of injection site infection. Overall satisfaction
was 40.1%.
In patients on anticoagulation, caution should be exercised when ICI
is used. A cross-sectional study found that the rate of bleeding events
was higher on patients with anticoagulation compared with those not
on the medication although it was NS.69, level III However, the study may
be underpowered.
Novel intracavernosal therapies including stem cell and platelet-rich
plasma have shown promising results but require more robust studies
before they can be recommended.2
•
Intraurethral alprostadil
For patients who are concerned with the AEs of PDE5is or refuse
ICIs, intraurethral alprostadil is an alternative. There are two methods
of administration. The first method is the Medicated Urethral System
for Erection (MUSE) where a pellet of alprostadil is inserted into the
urethra. A recent method uses topical cream that can be applied into
the urethra meatus or onto the glans penis.
In a systematic review, five RCTs showed significant improvement in
erection which was sufficient for intercourse in MUSE compared with
placebo. However, MUSE was shown to be inferior to ICIs. In one
of the RCTs on patients post-bilateral nerve sparing prostatectomy,
MUSE was comparable to sildenafil in effectiveness but had lower
compliance.70, level I There was no mention on quality assessment of the
primary papers.
In a multi-centre pre-post study on ED, 74% of patients demonstrated
overall improvement in EF with topical alprostadil. About 12% of patients
discontinued the treatment due to hypo-/hyper-responsiveness while
<5% did so because of AEs.71, level II-3
The most common AEs with topical alprostadil are local pain (29 - 41%)
and dizziness with possible hypotension (1.9 - 14%). Penile fibrosis
and priapism are rare (<1%). Urethral bleeding (5%) and urinary tract
infections (0.2%) may occur if it is administered into the urethra.2
• ICI and intraurethral alprostadil are options in the treatment of ED.
However, both are not available locally yet.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
4.3
Mechanical Treatment
In the landscape of evolving treatment options for ED, mechanical
devices have been used with success and safe to maintain an erection
as discussed below. The common mechanical devices available are
vacuum erection devices (VEDs) and low-intensity extracorporeal
shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT). Refer to Appendix 6 for Mechanical
Treatment in ED.
a) Vacuum erection device
A pre-post study to investigate satisfaction with VED for middleaged and older male veterans with ED and their female partners
showed:72, level II-3
• majority of patients achieved favourable outcomes i.e. -
 96.0% reported the ability to maintain an erection and 90.7%
were able to engage with intercourse; however, the older age
group (>65 years) was associated with significant difficulty in
obtaining erections and engaging in sexual intercourse
 92.0% had improved intercourse
 93.9% mentioned that their sexual relationship with partner
was satisfactory or very satisfactory
• 83.8% of female partners rated sex as better
• 23% of patients reported physical discomfort (e.g. difficulties
placing the bands on the cylinder, sliding them on the penis,
removing them after sex or pain)
• 9.1% reported having psychological discomfort (e.g. frustration
and lack of spontaneity)
In an RCT of men with type 2 DM and ED treated with either combination
of sildenafil 100 mg and VED, and sildenafil 100 mg alone, the former
showed:73, level I
• significantly higher IIEF scores at one month (14.86±2.17 vs
12.41±2.63) and three months (17.53±2.95 vs 14.29±2.81)
• significantly higher rates of successful penetration (73.3% vs
46.6%) and successful intercourse (70.0% vs 46.6%) at three
months
The AEs (e.g. penile bruising and numbness for VED) were mostly mild
and did not affect the patients’ daily life.
Refer to Appendix 7 for Application of Vacuum Erectile Device
(VED).
b) Shockwave therapy
An RCT showed that Li-ESWT improved the EF of young patients with
vasculogenic mild ED compared with placebo. The findings showed that
Li-ESWT increased the mean IIEF-EF scores at three months follow-up
(p=0.003) apart from successful penetration (SEP2) and intercourse
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
(SEP3) in >50% of attempts (p=0.001).74, level I There were limitations in
the methodological quality of this RCT.
Two pre-post studies on moderate ED showed that Li-ESWT significantly
improved EF post-treatment.75 - 76, level II-3 It was also found to be safe
as patients reported no irritative urinary symptoms and intracutaneous
activity after undergoing the treatment.75, level II-3
A local technology review on the effectiveness and safety of Li-ESWT
among patients with ED showed that the intervention:77, level I
• was mostly benefited in younger men with mild to moderate ED
and those with fewer co-morbidities
• was effective from three to six months
• enhanced the medication responses in PDE5i non-responders
• when used with adjuvant daily therapy, increased its effectiveness
and duration of effect
• was also safe and well tolerated with modest improvement
The treatment was recommended to be performed only by the urologists.
This is because they are involved in the entire holistic management
of the patients and understand the mechanisms of action to tailor the
treatment plan.
Refer to Appendix 8 for Low-intensity Extracorporeal Shockwave
Therapy.
Recommendation 4
• Mechanical devices (e.g. using vacuum erection device or shockwave
therapy) may be offered in erectile dysfunction (ED).
• Low-intensity
extracorporeal
shockwave
therapy
should
be
performed by urologists for mild to moderate ED.
4.4
Surgical Intervention
Surgical interventions in ED include penile revascularisation surgery
and PP.
a) Penile revascularisation surgery
Vascular ED can be subcategorised as arterial insufficiency (AI),
veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or mixed, with VOD being the most
common finding. Generally, the affected patients tend to develop ED
at a younger age and may have a history of preceding trauma. Penile
revascularisation is usually done in a very specialised centre outside
of Malaysia.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
•
Arterial insufficiency
AI occurs when there is inadequate arterial blood to the penis at the time
of erection and may result if the artery cannot dilate appropriately after
neurochemical signalling or if the upstream vascular flow is restricted.
Consensus guidelines by the International Consultation on Sexual
Medicine (ICSM) recommend that men with ED who satisfy the criteria
of the index patient (<55 years with recently acquired ED from focal
arterial occlusive disease in the absence of other risk factors e.g.
smoking, DM) can be considered for penile revascularisation procedures
(microsurgery or endovascular intervention). However, current data do
not support one procedure over another in terms of effectiveness.78
Short- and long-term complications of microsurgery include wound
infection (2.8%), urinary tract infection (2.6%), inguinal hernias (2.8%),
sepsis (3.5%), wound haematoma (7.8 - 25%), loss of penile length
(28%), decreased penile sensitivity (24.7%) and glans hyperaemia
(4 - 21%).78
Potential complications of endovascular treatment (balloon angioplasty
with or without stent insertion) include vascular injury, puncture site
aneurysm, infection, contrast-induced nephropathy. ICSM consensus
guidelines reports NS AEs.78
•
Veno-occlusive disease
VOD occurs when an erection cannot be achieved or maintained despite
an adequate arterial supply. It is most likely results from endothelial and
smooth muscle dysfunction leading to inadequate sinusoidal expansion
and insufficient closure of emissary veins.
Both consensus guidelines of ICSM and EAU Guidelines 2023 do not
recommend venous surgery or embolisation for VOD.2; 78
• Vascular ED should be suspected in patients with ED at a younger
age with the absence of other risk factors.
b) Penile prosthesis
In Malaysia, PP is usually used when other treatment modalities have
failed. There are several types including malleable, 2-piece inflatable
and 3-piece inflatable systems.
In a pre-post study of ED patients with failure of medical treatment who
received inflatable PP, overall patients’ and partners’ satisfaction was
85% and 76% respectively.79, level II-3
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
A meta-analysis with low-to-moderate risk of bias of primary studies on
men with ED of any aetiology showed that 52.9% inflatable PP device
survived at 20 years.80, level II-3
Main AEs include mechanical failure (<5% in five years) and infection
(2 - 3% in low-risk patients). High-risk patients include patients
undergoing revision surgery, those with impaired host defences (e.g.
immunosuppression, DM or spinal cord injury [SCI]) or those with penile
corporal fibrosis. Other AEs include implant erosion (1 - 6%) as well as
glans ischaemia and necrosis.2
Refer to Appendix 9 for Examples of Penile Prosthesis.
Recommendation 5
• Penile prothesis may be offered to patients with erectile dysfunction
who have failed other interventions.
4.5
Psychological Intervention
Psychosocial intervention plays a vital role in ED treatment because
both psychological and social factors predispose and perpetuate
erectile problems. It is recommended to involve the partner in this
management of ED as it may help to identify sexual difficulties among the
partners.18, level III; 55, level III The main components of psychosocial
treatment of ED include psychoeducation, cognitive and behavioural
techniques, aimed at reducing anxiety, challenging dysfunctional
beliefs, increasing sexual stimulation, disrupting sexual avoidance and,
increasing intimacy and communication skills in a relational context.
Sex therapy is a specific type of psychotherapy, focusing specifically on
sexual experiences.55, level III
In a Cochrane systematic review on the effectiveness of psychosocial
interventions for the treatment of ED, the findings were:81, level I
• focused sex-group therapy was more effective in reducing the
persistence of ED than control (no treatment) (RR=0.13, 95% CI
0.04 to 0.43)
• group therapy with sildenafil showed increased reduction of
persistent ED compared with sildenafil alone (RR=0.46, 95% CI
0.24 to 0.88)
• NS difference in effectiveness between psychosocial interventions
vs local injection and vacuum devices
However, there were limitations in the methodological quality of the
primary studies.
The above findings were supported by a later meta-analysis.82, level I
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
Another meta-analysis of RCTs looked into the effectiveness of the
following comparisons in the treatment of ED:83, level I
• a specific psychological intervention vs wait-list
• two specific psychological interventions against each other
• a combination of psychological treatment and medication vs
medication only
The psychological interventions included sex therapy, marital therapy,
educational intervention and other psychotherapies. The findings
revealed moderate improvement in the symptom severity and sexual
satisfaction of ED participants, however it was not significant.83, level I
The primary studies were of low-to-moderate quality.
A meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of psychological
interventions alone, PDE5i alone and their combination in the
treatment of ED. The psychological intervention comprised of
counselling, sex therapy, cognitive-behavioural sex therapy (CBST)
and psychoeducation, delivered on an individual basis, with couples,
in group settings or via the internet. The analysis was reported as
below.84, level I
• Combined treatment had a superior effect on ED symptoms than
PDE5i or psychological intervention alone (Cohen’s d=0.45, 95%
CI 0.02 to 0.89).
• There were NS differences between psychological intervention
alone and PDE5is alone with respect to impact on ED symptoms.
• The effectiveness of the combined treatment remained consistent,
regardless of the level of intensity in the psychological intervention.
However, the quality of the primary studies was low.
An umbrella review of meta-analyses on ED also supported the finding
that combined treatment of PDE5i and psychological intervention was
more effective than PDE5i alone (RR=2.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.92). Other
findings were:85, level I
• group psychotherapy was superior to wait-list (RR=2.50, 95% CI
1.09 to 5.72)
• non-pharmacological treatments rarely reported any AEs
Based on GRADE, the quality of primary studies was very low.
In a recent systematic review of RCTs comparing the effectiveness
of PDE5i alone, psychological intervention alone or a combination of
both interventions in psychogenic ED, the combined interventions were
more effective than the monotherapies in EF which was mainly based
on IIEF scores. Examples of the psychological interventions assessed
in the review were individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)/CBST,
group therapy and counselling and, couple CBST.86, level I
Qualitative findings in a mixed method study among patients with
situational ED who received mindfulness-based group treatment
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
consisting of daily home-practice activities and, integrated elements
of psychoeducation, sex therapy and mindfulness skills showed that
patients:87, level II-3
• perceived the group treatment as safe and supportive, and
validated their own experience which led to a reduction of
stigmatisation for male sexual dysfunction
• were able to identify and reduce their performance anxiety
• reported improvements in self-efficacy and acceptance regarding
their conditions
• had better insights into the significance of communicating and
gaining support from their partners
A meta-analysis which included four RCTs on ED and one on both
ED and premature ejaculation compared internet- and mobile-based
psychological interventions (IMIs) with control. IMIs were more
effective but with small effect sizes (Hedge’s g=0.18) in improving
sexual functioning in men. All IMIs were based on the principle of
CBT together with elements of sexual therapy including treatment
components e.g. psychosexual education, cognitive restructuring,
sensate focus, communication, etc. Based on Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2)
tool by the Cochrane Collaboration, all five RCTs have some concerns
risk of bias.88, level I
Recommendation 6
• An integrated and collaborative approach with psychological
interventions should be considered in the treatment of erectile
dysfunction.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
5.
TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
Traditional and complementary medicine (TCM) has been used for the
prevention and treatment of ED for many years. The mechanisms of
action remain unclear and warrant further clinical investigations.
A meta-analysis on nine RCTs comparing combination therapy of PDE5i
and antioxidants (e.g. propionyl-L-carnitine or L-arginine) with PDE5i
monotherapy in patients mainly with ED showed that the combination
therapy was more effective based on IIEF score (WMD=1.99, 95% CI
1.34 to 2.63) without increasing AEs. The nine RCTs were mainly of
low-risk of bias category.67, level I
A systematic review assessed various TCMs in the management of ED.
A meta-analysis of seven RCTs demonstrated the effectiveness of red
ginseng in the treatment of ED compared with placebo in:89, level I
• response rate (based on IIEF score) with RR of 2.40 (95% CI 1.65
to 3.51)
• psychogenic ED (based on global efficacy question) with RR of
2.05 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.16)
• sexual function (based on IIEF and Watts sexual function score)
with SMD of 0.79 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.12)
However, the methodological quality of the included RCTs was
averagely low.
Apart from the above, the other findings of the review were:89, level I
• yohimbine was a reasonable therapeutic option compared with
placebo and, had infrequent and reversible AEs
• acupuncture was inconclusive in ED treatment due to scarce
evidence
• There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of TCM
including Tongkat Ali in the treatment of ED.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
6.
FOLLOW-UP
The follow-up for a patient with ED depends on the individual case and
the initial treatment plan. Generally:2; 90, level III
• short-term follow-up -
For patients initiating treatment with oral medications, a short-term
follow-up within a few weeks to a couple of months may be appropriate
to assess response and tolerance to the medication.
• long-term follow-up -
Once a treatment plan has been established, long-term follow-up may
be scheduled at regular intervals. This allows for ongoing assessment
of treatment effectiveness, potential adjustments to the treatment plan
and monitoring for any emerging health issues.
• as needed follow-up -
For patients using on-demand treatments or lifestyle modifications,
follow-up may be scheduled on an as-needed basis, depending on their
progress and any changes in their health status.
• referral back to primary care -
If a urologist has been involved in the initial evaluation and management,
the urologist may refer the patient back to his primary care physician for
ongoing follow-up if the ED is stable and well-managed.
It is important to note that these are specific follow-up plans and will
vary based on the patient’s individual circumstances and response
to treatment. Regular communication and collaboration between the
primary care physician and the urologist, if involved, are key components
of effective care for individuals with ED.
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
7.
REFERRAL
Referring a patient with ED to a urologist or other relevant specialist is
typically considered when/at:
• Primary care evaluation: The primary care physician has assessed
the patient, taken a detailed medical history and performed a
physical examination. If the underlying cause of ED is not evident
or if there are concerns about specific urological issues, a referral
may be appropriate.
• Treatment failure or complexity: If initial treatments, e.g. lifestyle
changes, oral medications (like PDE5i) or other conservative
measures, do not yield satisfactory results or if a case is complex
and may require specialised interventions (e.g. penile injections,
VEDs or surgical options), a urologist may be consulted.
• Underlying medical conditions: Presence of co-morbidities that
might contribute to or exacerbate ED e.g. diabetes mellitus,
CVD, or hormonal disorders, consultation with a urologist and/or
endocrinologist/cardiologist may be warranted.
• Psychological factors: If psychological factors are suspected to
be a significant contributor to the ED, collaboration with a mental
health professional may be necessary. However, urologists may
still play a role in addressing any physical aspects of the condition.

SPECIAL POPULATIONS
8.1
Patients with Cardiac Disease
Managing ED in patients with cardiac disease requires a comprehensive
approach. Patients with atrial fibrillation showed an ED prevalence of
57% (95% CI 50 to 64) based on a meta-analysis.91, level II-2
In a cohort study among patients attending an exercise stress test
(EST) clinic, it was found that patients with negative EST were less
likely to have ED compared with those with positive EST (OR=0.18,
p<0.001).92, level II-2
Based on a large network meta-analysis on PDE5i and its doses in ED,
sildenafil 50 mg was the most effective (84% probability in SUCRA) in
improving IIEF scores when compared with placebo among patients
with CV disorders. In terms of safety, vardenafil and udenafil had the
best benefit-risk profiles in these studies.58, level I Udenafil is not available
locally yet.
In addition, a pre-post study among patients with ED with their CV
risk based on Framingham risk score showed that tadalafil 10 mg ondemand improved IIEF scores in all risk groups (p<0.001). However,
a few factors were associated with the failure of tadalafil to achieve
complete responsiveness i.e.:93, level II-3
• increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level by every 1 mg/dL
(OR=1.022, 95% CI 1.013 to 1.053)
• presence of hypertension (OR=2.217, 95% CI 1.015 to 2.987)
• higher Framingham score (OR=4.127, 95% CI 1.423 to 4.873)
• severe ED at the beginning of treatment (OR=3.102, 95% CI
1.325 to 5.450)
In an RCT comparing the effectiveness of sexual rehabilitation (physical
exercise, pelvic floor exercise and psychoeducational consultation) with
usual care among patients with ED and with either IHD and/or CAD, the
former was superior in terms of:94, level I
• improved sexual function with a mean difference in IIEF score of
6.7 (95% CI 3.1 to 10.4) at four months and 6.7 (95% CI 3.2 to
10.1) at six months
• improved exercise capacity on cycle ergometer measured by
Watt max (MD=10.3, 95% CI 3.6 to 16.9) and pelvic floor strength
(p<0.01)
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
• Certain drugs used for the management of cardiac conditions may
need to be assessed in patients with ED.
 The use of PDE5i is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates for
cardiac conditions due to the risk of hypotension.66, level III; 95, level III
• The appropriateness of using PDE5i is based on patient’s cardiac
status and medication regimen.
• A multidisciplinary team consisting of cardiologist, urologist, family
medicine specialist, psychiatrist and/or rehabilitative physician are
important in managing patients with ED and cardiac disease.
8.2
Patients with Diabetes Mellitus
The prevalence of ED among patients with DM is relatively high, thus
they should be regularly screened for the medical condition and vice
versa. Optimisation of glycaemic control and other risk factors should
be advocated as the treatment of ED. Refer to CPG on Management of
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (6th Edition).96
8.3
Patients with Pelvic Surgery or Prostate Cancer Treatment
ED is a well-known complication of pelvic surgery especially for cancers
e.g. rectal, prostate and bladder cancer. Potential mechanisms include
direct injury to the neurovascular bundles (e.g. fibrosis and ischaemia)
that control the complex mechanism of the erectile response.
Radical treatment for prostate cancer includes radical prostatectomy,
brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) which can
damage the neurovascular bundles.
A cohort study on patients diagnosed with locoregional prostate cancer
treated with surgery or radiation showed:97, level II-2
• ED was more prevalent in patients having prostatectomy compared
with those receiving radiation (65.3% vs 33.8%, p<0.001)
• radiation group had a greater median time to ED diagnosis (346
vs 133 days, p<0.001)
A systematic review reported a prevalence of ED ranging from
25 - 100% post-radical prostatectomy.98, level III This is supported by a
narrative review that showed that the incidence was between 29% and-
88%.99, level III Factors predicting preservation of EF post-operatively
include the patient’s age, baseline EF and tumour size.2
Patients being considered for nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy
should have good EF pre-operatively. Post-operative EF recovery
can occur up to 48 months after radical prostatectomy. It has been
suggested that post-operative therapy of any type should be initiated
as soon as possible after the surgery.2
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
A Cochrane systematic review found that PDE5i was more effective than
placebo in ED treatment post-nerve sparing open radical prostatectomy
(OR=10.09, 95% CI 6.2 to 16.43). Analysis of two RCTs post-EBRT
showed that PDE5i was also more effective than placebo in improving
EF. However, the quality assessment for the RCTs on both outcomes
was poor.100, level I
In another meta-analysis mentioned earlier, a subgroup analysis on
the effectiveness of tadalafil 5 mg once-a-day and tadalafil 20 mg ondemand dosing regimen in post-treatment for prostate cancer reported
NS in IIEF-EF domain score but significant difference favouring the
once-a-day regimen in SEP2.61, level I
In an RCT on men treated for ED after bilateral nerve-sparing
prostatectomy, combination of VED and tadalafil 20 mg vs tadalafil 20
mg alone was compared. It showed that the combination treatment had
significantly higher:101, level I
• IIEF scores at 6 - 12 months
• penile hardness scores after 6 - 9 months
• percentage of successful vaginal penetration at 3 - 9 months
• percentage of ability to have intercourse to orgasm at six and
12 months
The AEs of VED were minor local discomfort and that of tadalafil was
headache, flushing and muscle ache.
• Multimodal penile rehabilitation with nerve sparing approach may
help to improve EF post-radical prostatectomy.
8.4
Spinal Cord Injury Survivors
SCI may lead to sensory, motor and autonomic abnormalities below the
spinal lesion and complex urologic conditions. Approximately about 20
- 30% of SCI patients have either no erections or erection not sufficient
for sexual intercourse.102, level I They are usually young individuals where
sexuality and reproduction are important.
A systematic review outlined the following ED treatment options in
patients with SCI:102, level I
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
• All of the above treatments may trigger autonomic dysreflexia* which
can potentially be life-threatening in SCI patients.
Autonomic dysreflexia is a dangerous syndrome involving an
overreaction of the autonomic nervous system. It causes a sudden and
severe rise of blood pressure in addition to other symptoms (unopposed
sympathetic responses e.g. shortness of breath, chest tightness,
flushing, throbbing headache and goosebumps).

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
Implementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality
healthcare services based on the best and most recent available
evidence applied to local scenario and expertise. Various factors and
resource implications should be considered for the successful uptake of
the CPG recommendations.
9.1
Facilitating and Limiting Factors
The facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:
i)
online availability of CPG on multiple websites for healthcare
providers
ii) conferences and updates on the management of ED including
those involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian Urological
Association and Malaysian Society of Andrology and the Study of
the Aging Male)
iii) public awareness campaigns on ED (e.g. Men’s Health Day)
Limiting factors in the CPG implementation include:
i)
different levels of expertise and wide variation in practice due to
resource constraints
ii) limited awareness and knowledge in the management of ED among
healthcare providers
iii) lack of confidence among healthcare providers in discussing ED
with patients
iv) social stigmatisation of ED among patients
9.2
Potential Resource Implications
The prevalence of ED is increasing which renders it to become an
emerging public health concern. This is made worse by the public and
healthcare providers shying away from identifying and discussing the
matter in the clinical practice. In diagnosing ED, healthcare providers
require expertise (knowledge and skills) to elicit the problem and
provide further management on it. Rigorous work-up and cardiovascular
assessment further complicate diagnosing ED. Treatment-wise,
the limited availability of pharmacotherapy and mechanical devices
makes treating ED even more difficult. There is also an obvious lack
of urologists and clinical psychologists especially in the public sector to
help manage such cases.
In line with the key recommendations in this CPG, the following is
proposed as clinical audit indicator for the quality management of ED:
Management of Erectile Dysfunction
Target of 100%
Target of 70%
Implementation strategies will be developed following the approval of
the CPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module
and they are available in the MoH and AMM websites after development.

APPLICATION OF VACUUM ERECTILE DEVICE (VED)
Source: Nadig PW. Vacuum erection devices: a review. World J Urol. 1990;8:114-117.
•
The equipment consists of a
vacuum chamber, a vacuum
pump, and a constricting ring or
band.
•
The pump can be operated
manually as shown, but usually
battery-operated for easy use.
•
An elastic band is used to
constrict the base of the penis
to maintain erection after it is
achieved.
•
Before the device is used, the
constricting band is lubricated
with a water-soluble jelly and
placed around the chamber
near its open end.
•
The
jelly
is
next
applied
generously to the base of the
penis to assure an air-tight seal.
•
The penis is placed in the
chamber and the vacuum is
applied for 3 - 6 minutes or until
it becomes rigid.
•
The constricting band is slid
off the end of the chamber to
constrict the base of the penis.
•
The vacuum is then released
and the chamber removed.
Sexual
intercourse
can
be
performed immediately after.
•
The band should not be left on
longer than 30 minutes.

LOW-INTENSITY EXTRACORPOREAL SHOCKWAVE THERAPY
How it works?
•
While the patient is lying down, ultrasound gel is applied to the applicator head and/or the treatment area.
•
The applicator head is applied to areas of the penile shaft and crus.
•
The shockwave technology skilfully creates waves that treat a broad area from the superficial surface of the penile shaft to the deeper erectile
tissues of the crura.
•
It is currently recommended that this treatment to be conducted once or twice a week, for at least 6 sessions.
•
The waves stimulate tissue and do not cause any pain or external scarring. Patients can resume daily regular activity after the procedure. Side
effects (if any) are usually mild and temporary.
•
Most patients report progress after 3 - 4 sessions.
