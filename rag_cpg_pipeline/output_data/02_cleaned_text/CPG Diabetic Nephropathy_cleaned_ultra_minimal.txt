DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
PREFACE
Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD)
worldwide. In Malaysia the Dialysis and Transplant Registry 2002
reported that diabetic nephropathy was the predominant cause of ESRD
accounting for 47% of new cases.(2) This places an enormous burden on
clinical, public health and economic resources as such patients often have
multiple co-morbid conditions such as coronary artery and peripheral
vascular disease.
Thus the Malaysian Society of Nephrology council deemed it appropriate
that a Clinical Practice Guideline on Diabetic Nephropathy be drawn up
to guide healthcare professionals, with the major objectives being
screening for diabetic nephropathy and instituting measures to prevent or
retard its progression.
This task was given to the Penang nephrologists as it dawned on the
council that the small island had a nephrologist in every corner! Apart
from nephrologists, the panel included an endocrinologist, a family
physician, an outpatient general practitioner, a cardiologist, and a
physician with interest in diabetes mellitus. The committee has attempted
to combine evidence based medicine with the practical strategies available
locally to formulate these recommendations.
These fourteen recommendations are intended to assist primary health
care doctors who manage diabetic patients in their day-to-day practice to
intervene early and effectively so that the onset and the course of diabetic
nephropathy can be ameliorated.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the panel members for their
hard work and commitment in preparing the guidelines. I would also like
to thank the secretariat for services rendered, all those who contributed to
the final draft presentation and finally to the Malaysian Society of
Nephrology council for their infinite patience in waiting for the
appearance of this guideline!

DEVELOPMENT OF THE GUIDELINE
•
Relevant key words and terms were determined by the committee
members. These were used to generate MEDLINE searches for
scientific literature in the English language focusing on peer reviewed
articles. The articles were retrieved for systematic review using a
check list to assess the validity of the studies.
•
A draft of the guideline was formulated based on the systematic
review of the literature including existing guidelines. Some
recommendations were modified taking into consideration local issues
such as costs and available resources. The rationale for the
modification was provided.
•
The draft was subjected to peer review in stages. It was distributed to
general practitioners, physicians, endocrinologists, nephrologists and
Malaysian Society of Nephrology members and amended following
their comments. A discussion of the recommendations was then made
at the annual seminar of the Malaysian Society of Nephrology in May
2003 followed by an open forum for doctors in Penang.
•
This guideline is structured for ease of reference. Each guideline is
tabulated, numbered and titled. The evidence and rationale for the
recommendation is provided to enable the reader to make an informed
decision appropriate to the individual patient.
•
This guideline complements the existing guideline on “Care of the
Diabetic Patient (The Malaysian Consensus practice guideline :
Second edition July 1999)”. The focus of this guideline is on the
prevention, screening and management of diabetic nephropathy.
•
Recommendations have been graded based on levels of evidence using
the following system: -
Based on evidence from one or more randomised clinical
trials and/or meta-analyses.
Based on evidence from high quality clinical trials but no
randomised clinical trial data available.
Based on expert committee reports and/or clinical
experience of respected authorities but lacking in directly
applicable studies of good quality.

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
Concomitant renal artery stenosis should be suspected :-
- when rapid deterioration of renal function occurs with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs)
- in the presence of severe peripheral vascular disease, renal bruits,
severe uncontrolled hypertension or unequal sized kidneys
NATURALHISTORY OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
Diabetic nephropathy is a spectrum of progressive renal lesions
secondary to diabetes mellitus ranging from renal hyperfiltration to
end stage kidney disease.
•
The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is the presence of
microalbuminuria (Table 1). It occurs in 30% of type 1 diabetics, 5 to
15 years after diagnosis but may be present at diagnosis in type 2
diabetics as the time of onset of type 2 diabetes is often unknown.
•
Microalbuminuria progresses to overt proteinuria over the next 7 to 10
years (Figure 1).
•
Once overt proteinuria develops, renal function progressively declines
and end stage renal failure is reached after about 10 years.
2
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
INTRODUCTION
•
In recent years there has been an increase in the prevalence of diabetes
worldwide. In Malaysia the prevalence of diabetes has increased from
6.3% in 1986 to 8.3% in 1996.(3)
•
With improvement in the survival of patients with diabetes,
nephropathy has now emerged as a major health problem.
•
Nephropathy develops in about 20-40% of diabetics. Known risk
factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy include genetic
predisposition, poor glycaemic control, hypertension and smoking.
•
Prevention, early detection and aggressive intervention are needed to
retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy to end stage renal
failure.
•
Cardiovascular disease is the commonest cause of death in patients
with diabetic nephropathy. Thus it is necessary to address the
associated risk factors for this condition.
DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
The diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is usually made clinically. Other
target organ involvement is often present. 90-95% of type 1 diabetics
and about 70% of type 2 diabetics with nephropathy will have
retinopathy as well. In the absence of retinopathy, non-diabetic renal
disease may need to be excluded.
•
Non-diabetic renal disease should also be considered when :-
- significant haematuria or urinary red blood cell casts are present
- renal failure occurs in the absence of proteinuria
- there is evidence of other systemic disease e.g. systemic lupus
erythematosus, myeloma, viral hepatitis
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
PREVENTION OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
One of the most important aspects in the management of diabetes
mellitus is to prevent macrovascular and microvascular complications
including diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease.
•
This may require a multidisciplinary team approach which includes
general practitioners, physicians, endocrinologists, dietitians and
trained diabetic nurses.
•
The focus of management should be on good glycaemic control which
includes patient education, lifestyle modification, diet, exercise,
attainment of ideal body weight and frequent self-monitoring of blood
glucose.
•
The strongest evidence in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy and
other microvascular complications has been with tight glycaemic
control. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in type
1 diabetics(5,6) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
(UKPDS) in type 2 diabetics(7) have shown that intensive blood glucose
control reduces the risk of developing nephropathy, retinopathy and
neuropathy.
•
Strategies to prevent diabetic nephropathy also include monitoring and
tight control of blood pressure.

Other factors affecting urinary albumin excretion should be excluded when screening
for microalbuminuria and proteinuria (Appendix 1).
Urine should be screened for proteinuria with conventional dipstick on
an early morning urine specimen*
Recommendation 2 : Method of screening for proteinuria
Grade C
•
Timed urine collection is the gold standard for screening and
quantification of urinary albumin excretion. However this is
expensive, impractical and collection is often incomplete. Refer to
Appendix 2.
•
Urine dipstick testing for albumin concentration or albumin/creatinine
ratio are quick, convenient tests that can give rapid on-site results.
Both tests have reasonable sensitivity and specificity(8).
•
Early morning urine should be used to minimise fluctuations in urinary
concentration and changes in AER related to posture and physical
a c t i v i t y.
Currently
available
methods
for
screening
of
microalbuminuria are listed in Appendix 3.
(a) If urine dipstick for proteinuria is negative, screening for
microalbuminuria should be performed on an early morning urine
specimen
(b) Urine dipstick for microalbuminuria is an acceptable screening test
(c) If microalbuminuria is detected, confirmation should be made with
two further tests within a 3 to 6 month period (see Algorithm)
(d) If microalbuminuria is not detected, re-screening should be
performed annually

SCREENING FOR MICROALBUMINURIA AND
OVERT PROTEINURIA
•
Microalbuminuria refers to the presence of a small amount of albumin
in the urine, which cannot be detected with the usual urine dipstick.
The definition depends on the method of urine collection (Table 2).

Other factors affecting urinary albumin excretion should be excluded when screening
for microalbuminuria and proteinuria (Appendix 1).
Screening for proteinuria should be performed yearly in the following
patients*:
(a) Type 1 diabetes mellitus: 5 years after diagnosis of diabetes, or
earlier in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors
(b) Type 2 diabetes mellitus: at the time of diagnosis of diabetes
Recommendation 1 : Screening for proteinuria
Grade C
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
The development of diabetic nephropathy has a devastating impact on
morbidity and mortality of patients with diabetes mellitus.
Microalbuminuria is a powerful and independent predictor of
cardiovascular death.(9,10)
•
Therapeutic intervention should include strategies to prevent or retard
the progression of diabetic renal disease as well as to reduce
cardiovascular complications.
•
The management of these patients includes good glycaemic control,
tight control of blood pressure, reduction of proteinuria with ACEIs or
ARBs, cessation of smoking, lipid control and salt and protein
restriction.
Glycaemic Control
FBS = fasting blood glucose, HbA1c = glycosylated haemoglobin
Glycaemic control should be optimised, with FBS ≤ 6 mmol/l and/or
HbA1c ≤ 7%
Recommendation 4 : Glycaemic control
Grade A
•
In type 1 diabetes mellitus, intensive treatment usually with multiple
insulin injections, coupled with self-management education and self
monitoring of blood glucose can achieve near ideal glucose and
HbA1c goals. The risk of getting microalbuminuria and albuminuria is
reduced with intensive treatment.(5)
•
Maintaining the HbA1c target long term can sustain the benefits.(6)
•
In type 2 diabetes, intensive blood glucose control can reduce the risk
of microvascular endpoints including albuminuria irrespective of the
drugs used,(7) except in overweight diabetics where metformin was
shown to have a significantly greater effect on any diabetic related
endpoints.(11)

Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study has demonstrated the
value of aiming for a diastolic pressure of less than 80mmHg to
reduce cardiovascular and other diabetic complications.(14) However
this can be difficult to achieve and multiple (2 or more) drugs may
be necessary.(19)
•
The choice of antihypertensive agent(s) should be individualised,
tailored to patients’ co-morbidities. Diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium
channel blockers, ACEIs or ARBs may be used to achieve the target
blood pressure.
•
ACEIs or ARBs may be considered as first line therapy for treatment
of hypertension in diabetics in the absence of contraindications.
Several studies have suggested that ACEIs(20-24) and ARBs(25) may
confer cardioprotective benefits beyond their blood pressure effect in
diabetics although other studies did not show specific advantages.(26,27)
ACEIs or ARBs should be initiated for the reduction of
microalbuminuria unless contraindicated
Recommendation 6 : Treatment of microalbuminuria
ACEIs in type 1 & type 2 diabetics : Grade A
ARBs in type 2 diabetics : Grade A
Microalbuminuria
Refer to Appendix 5 for dosage of commonly used ACEIs and ARBs
•
ACEIs(24) and ARBs have been shown to reduce microalbuminuria in
diabetic patients independent of their effect on blood pressure.
•
In type 1 diabetic patients with or without hypertension, ACEIs have
been shown to reduce microalbuminuria.(28-31) In type 2 diabetics,
ACEIs(32-38) and more recently ARBs(39-41) have been shown to reduce
microalbuminuria.
10
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
Any reduction of HbA1c can reduce the risk of diabetic
complications.(12)
•
In the presence of renal failure the dose of hypoglycaemic agents
should be adjusted to avoid hypoglycaemia. Refer to Appendix 4.
•
Tight blood pressure control is the primary goal in the management of
hypertension in diabetics. This may be achieved with any
antihypertensive agent.
•
Hypertension
aggravates
microvascular
and
macrovascular
complications of diabetes including diabetic nephropathy.(13)
•
Diabetics benefit more from aggressive blood pressure lowering
compared to non-diabetics in the reduction of cardiovascular events.( 1 4 - 1 6 )
•
Tight blood pressure control is also important to slow the progression
of nephropathy and deterioration of renal function.(17,18)
•
Target blood pressure should be less than 130/80mmHg if this can be
safely achieved. Although the target is relatively arbitrary, the
Blood Pressure Control
In type 1 diabetics, blood pressure rises with the development of
microalbuminuria. With the onset of overt proteinuria, hypertension is
usually present and worsens as the nephropathy progresses. However in
type 2 diabetics, hypertension may precede the onset of diabetic
nephropathy and is often associated with the metabolic syndrome of
obesity, insulin resistance and hyperlipidaemia.
Target blood pressure in diabetics should be less than 130/80mmHg
Recommendation 5 : Target blood pressure
Grade A
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
Landmark studies of ACEIs in type 1( 4 2 ) and ARBs in type 2
diabetics(43,44) have shown the effectiveness of these agents to retard the
progression of overt diabetic nephropathy. In these trials, there were
significant reductions in the risk of doubling of plasma creatinine and
developing renal failure. These benefits were independent of blood
pressure lowering.
•
The role of ACEIs in type 2 diabetics with overt nephropathy is less
clear. As yet, large long-term studies on hard renal endpoints have not
been performed. Small scale studies have shown beneficial effect on
proteinuria but data on retardation of progression of renal failure is
limited.(36,45-49) Despite the lack of direct evidence, an ACEI is a
reasonable alternative to an ARB as it is cheaper and more widely
available.
•
Current data suggests that ACEI/ARB should be instituted even in
patients with moderately severe renal failure.(43,44) However renal
function should be monitored closely. Refer to Appendix 5.
•
Several small studies have indicated that the combination of ACEI and
ARB may have additive effect in lowering blood pressure and
proteinuria in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria(50,51) and overt
nephropathy.(52,53) Data on long term renoprotective benefits is required.
•
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have class specific effect on
proteinuria. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem)
have
consistently been
shown
to reduce proteinuria but
dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine) have variable
effect.(54-57)
•
There is currently insufficient evidence to support a specific
recommendation on the use of sulodexide, a glycosaminoglycan, in
the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Small scale studies with shortterm follow-up have suggested that sulodexide may be useful to
reduce urinary albumin excretion rate in type 1 and type 2 diabetics
with microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria.(58,59) The data on its effect
on renal function is limited.
12
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
In patients with proteinuria > 1 g/day, target blood pressure should be
lowered to < 125/75mmHg
Recommendation 7 : Target blood pressure in overt nephropathy
Grade B
(a) In Type 1 diabetics with overt proteinuria, ACEIs should be
initiated unless contraindicated
(b) In Type 2 diabetics with overt proteinuria, ARBs or ACEIs should
be initiated unless contraindicated
Recommendation 8 : Treatment of overt proteinuria
Grade A
ARBs : Grade A
ACEIs : Grade B
Overt Proteinuria
The target is extrapolated from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) study where 3% of subjects were diabetics. In the subset of
patients with proteinuria of more than 1 g/day, lowering of blood pressure
to below 125/75mmHg was associated with reduction in deterioration of
renal function.(17)
This is the stage when urine is positive for protein by conventional
dipstick. Treatment at this stage should be aimed at aggressive lowering
of blood pressure and reduction of proteinuria.
•
Early studies on type 1 diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated the
e ffectiveness of blood pressure control with conventional
antihypertensive agents in reducing proteinuria and deterioration of
renal function.(18)
•
The most compelling evidence supporting drug specific advantages
beyond blood pressure control has been with ACEIs and ARBs.
Refer to Appendix 5 for dosage of commonly used ACEIs and ARBs.
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
In diabetics :
(a) therapeutic lifestyle changes should be instituted if LDLcholesterol is > 2.6 mmol/l
(b) drug therapy should be considered if LDL-cholesterol is > 3.4
mmol/l
Recommendation 11 : Correction of dyslipidaemia
Grade B*
•
Dyslipidaemia in diabetics should be identified and aggressively
treated.
•
All diabetics should be encouraged to go on a therapeutic lifestyle
change comprising increased physical activity, reduction in intake of
saturated fat and cholesterol, as well as achievement of ideal body
weight.(69)
•
Therapy with lipid lowering drugs, especially with statins, has been
shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetics
and in other patients at high risk of clinical atherosclerotic disease.(70-72)
•
There have been no large randomised placebo-controlled trials to show
the effects of lipid lowering in patients with diabetic nephropathy.
Nevertheless the beneficial outcome of lipid lowering in the diabetic
population in general supports aggressive on-going therapy when
nephropathy develops.
•
In diabetics with LDL-cholesterol above 3.4 mmol/l, drug therapy
should be considered to achieve an ideal LDL-cholesterol level of
under 2.6 mmol/l (or to achieve non- HDL-cholesterol of under 3.4
mmol/l). Statins are drugs of first choice, with fibrates as an alternative
especially in those with
low
HDL-cholesterol and
high
triglycerides.(73,74)
* recommendations are graded on evidence from trials on diabetics in general as data in
diabetic nephropathy is limited
14
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
Cigarette smoking should be actively discouraged
Recommendation 9 : Cessation of smoking
Grade B
Smoking
There is clear epidemiological evidence to link smoking to increased risk
of cardiovascular events. Smoking has also been shown to accelerate
progression of diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease and cessation of
smoking ameliorates the decline of renal function.(60-62) Thus patients with
diabetic nephropathy should be strongly advised against smoking.
Full lipid profile should be performed at least annually in adult diabetics
Recommendation 10 : Monitoring of serum lipids
Grade C
Lipids
•
Diabetics often have abnormal lipid profiles with raised serum
triglycerides, cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol level.
•
While dyslipidaemia may aggravate renal disease,(63) the evidence
that correction of lipid abnormality slows progression of renal failure
is still lacking.(64-68)
•
Lipid profile should be performed at least annually. However more
frequent monitoring may be required particularly after commencement
of treatment to achieve target levels. (69)
•
In diabetic children lipid monitoring every 5 years may be
sufficient.(69)
•
In type 1 diabetics, tight glycaemic control is associated with normal
lipoprotein level. Thus, good glycaemic control in type 1 diabetics may
be more important than in type 2 diabetics to reduce cardiovascular
risk.(70)
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
Referral to a nephrologist should be made if the serum creatinine
exceeds 200 umol/L
Recommendation 14 : Referral to nephrologist
Grade C
Referral
•
Several studies have shown that late referral leads to increased
morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and early mortality on dialysis.(86-94)
Uraemic symptoms and complications often occur earlier in diabetics
compared to non-diabetics and dialysis may be required once GFR
falls to 10 to 15mls/min.(95-97)
•
Pre-dialysis evaluation should be considered once the serum creatinine
exceeds 200 umol/l. Measures that would need to be instituted include :-
- optimisation of blood pressure control and proteinuria reduction to
retard further progression of renal failure
- correction of anaemia
- correction of calcium and phosphate abnormalities
- nutritional management
- counselling and assessment for dialysis
- early preparation of access for dialysis
•
Earlier referral to a nephrologist may be indicated if :-
- the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is in doubt e.g. proteinuria
occurs in the absence of retinopathy, renal failure occurs without
proteinuria
- nephrotic syndrome or unexplained haematuria occurs
- a sudden worsening of renal function occurs
- blood pressure is difficult to control
- hyperkalaemia arises
- renal artery stenosis is suspected
•
Diabetic patients on renal replacement therapy (i.e. dialysis or
transplant) have a 2 to 4 times higher mortality risk than non-diabetic
patients, mainly from cardiovascular disease. Coronary artery
revascularisation may reduce this complication especially in type 1
diabetics.(98,99)
16
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
As patients with renal failure are at a higher risk of myositis with lipid
lowering drugs lower doses should be used when commencing therapy
and increased cautiously. Combination of statins and fibrates should be
avoided in renal failure. Refer to Appendix 4.
Moderate protein restriction of 0.6 – 0.8 g/kg/day* may be considered
in patients with overt nephropathy and/or renal impairment
Recommendation 12 : Protein restriction
Grade B
Diet
* one matchbox sized cooked protein source is equivalent to 7g of protein
•
With the onset of overt nephropathy, protein restriction of
0.8g/kg/body weight or less may be useful in slowing the decline of
GFR.(75-78) More severe protein restriction of < 0.6g/kg/body weight
may further retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However,
this should be supervised by an experienced dietitian to prevent
malnutrition.(79)
Sodium intake should be restricted to < 80mmol/day (or 5g sodium
chloride)* in patients with hypertension and/or proteinuria
Recommendation 13 : Sodium restriction
Grade B
* equivalent to 1 teaspoon of salt
•
High sodium intake should be avoided.
•
Moderate sodium restriction can potentiate the hypotensive effect of
many antihypertensives.(80-83)
•
A low sodium diet enhances the antiproteinuric effects of some
antihypertensives e.g. ARBs, ACEIs.(84,85)

Methods of urine collection
24-hour urine collection
•
24-hour urine collection minimises fluctuations in urinary albumin
excretion (UAE) due to diurnal variation.
•
Patients should receive clear instructions on how to collect the urine
sample to avoid incomplete collection.
•
Patients should be instructed to pass urine completely at a specified
time. The first urine voided is NOT collected.
•
Subsequently ALL urine passed should be collected into a urine bottle
until the next day when the last sample of urine is collected at precisely
the same time as the first voided urine.
•
Patients should be instructed to void completely at first and last void
particularly in patients with incomplete evacuation of the bladder e.g.
patients with diabetic cystopathy, prostatic hypertrophy or other
bladder outlet obstruction.
Timed overnight urine collection
•
Patients should be instructed to pass urine completely before retiring to
bed and to record the exact time. The urine voided is NOT collected.
•
Subsequently any urine passed during the night should be collected
into a bottle.
•
Upon waking the next morning, the patient should pass urine
completely into the bottle. The exact time of this collection should be
recorded.

•
The urine should be sent to the laboratory for quantification of urinary
albumin on the same day.
•
UAE (µg/min) = urine albumin concentration (µg/l) x urine volume (l)
duration of urine collection (min)
Early morning spot urine
•
An early morning urine sample is more reliable than a random sample.
The urine of an early morning sample is more concentrated and less
liable to be affected by fluid intake during daytime. Early morning
collection also minimises variation in albumin excretion rate due to
changes in posture and physical activity.
•
Patients should be instructed to pass urine before retiring to bed.
•
The next morning, the first urine voided should be collected and
brought to the clinic for testing as early as possible.

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
•
Gliclazide, glipizide and glimepiride (completely metabolised to
inactive products) are safer alternatives. Lower starting doses should
be used.
Meglitinides
•
Repaglinide and nateglinide have short half-lives and duration of
action with lower risk of hypoglycaemia.
Thiazolidinediones
•
Rosiglitazone can be used in mild to moderate renal failure but can
cause fluid retention.

Dose adjustment in renal failure*
Dosage of hypoglycaemic agents in renal failure
od = once daily, bd = twice daily, tds = three times daily
*Refer to Appendix 6 for Cockcroft-Gault formula to estimate renal function
Insulin
•
In renal failure the dose of insulin should be reduced to avoid
hypoglycaemia as insulin is degraded by the kidney.
•
Conversion to short acting insulin may be required.
Biguanides
•
Metformin should be avoided if the serum creatinine is above 150 -
200umol/L as it can rarely cause lactic acidosis in renal failure.
Sulphonylureas
•
Chlorpropamide is contraindicated in renal failure as it has a long halflife and its metabolites retain some hypoglycaemic effects.
•
Glibenclamide should be avoided in renal failure as it has a long
biologic effect despite its short plasma half-life.

•
ACEIs/ARBs should be used with caution in patients with bilateral
renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis of a single functioning
kidney.
•
ACEIs/ARBs should be started at lower doses in renal failure and
titrated gradually to maximal tolerable dose to achieve anti-proteinuric
effect.
•
Serum potassium and creatinine should be checked prior to and within
one to two weeks after initiating an ACEI or ARB as they can
occasionally cause worsening of renal function.
•
If serum creatinine increases acutely by more than 35%(102) or severe
hyperkalaemia occurs, the drug may need to be reduced or withdrawn.
Renal artery stenosis may need to be excluded.
•
Diuretics may potentiate the hypotensive and anti-proteinuric effect of
ACEIs/ARBs.
•
Potassium sparing diuretics may worsen hyperkalaemia when
combined with ACEI/ARB in the presence of renal failure. Careful
monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.
