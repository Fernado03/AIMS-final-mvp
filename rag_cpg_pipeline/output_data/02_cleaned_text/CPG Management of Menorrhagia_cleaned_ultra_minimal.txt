GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
Guidelines Development
The work group for the development of these guidelines comprised Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists from various Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education facilities.
These guidelines were adapted from other international guidelines on management of
menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleeding and modified to suit the local situation. These
include guidelines from New Zealand, Canada and the Royal College of Obstetrics and
Gynaecologists, UK. A systematic review of current evidence was carried out. Ranking
of evidence are based on a modified version of those used by the Catalonia Agency for
Health Technology Assessment (CAHTA) Spain; the classification of recommendation
was emulated from those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network
(SIGN). The ranking of evidence is based on a modified version of that suggested by the
Catalonia Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Research (CAHTAR) Spain,
while the grading of recommendations in these guidelines emulates those used by the
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).The draft guidelines were posted on
both the Ministry of Health Malaysia and Academy of Medicine, Malaysia websites for
comment and feedback. These guidelines have also been presented to the Technical
Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and Health Technology Assessment
and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and
approval.
Objectives
The aim of this guideline is to aid doctors in general practice and gynaecologists in
clinical decision making, by providing well-balanced information on the management of
patients with menorrhagia.
Clinical Questions
The clinical questions for these guidelines are:
i.
How should the extent of heavy menstrual flow (menorrhagia) be assessed?
ii.
How can menorrhagia be alleviated?
iii.
How can patients with menorrhagia be treated successfully?
Target Population
These guidelines are developed to apply to women with menorrhagia.
Target Group
These guidelines are meant for all health care providers.

BACKGROUND
Menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding, is an important cause of ill health in women.
It is estimated that 9 to 30 percent of women of reproductive age suffer from
menorrhagia, the prevalence increasing with age, and peaking just prior to menopause
(Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, 2001; level 9). Menorrhagia has
an impact on many women’s lives, with one in twenty women aged 30 - 49 with
menorrhagia consulting their general practitioners each year. It has been found that once
referred to a gynaecologist, 60% of women with menorrhagia will have a hysterectomy
within five years, accounting for up to 75 percent of all hysterectomies performed
worldwide. (RCOG, 1998; 2001; level 9)
Apart from surgery, medical therapy, appears to be an attractive treatment option, there
being a wide variety of medication available to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding
including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones, anti-fibrinolytics, and
intrauterine devices. However, there is considerable variation in practice, and uncertainty,
about the most appropriate therapy, due to age, desire to preserve fertility, co-existing
medical conditions, and patient preferences (RCOG, 1998; 2001; level 9).
2
DEFINITION
Menorrhagia can be defined as a complaint of heavy cyclical menstrual blood loss over
several consecutive menstrual cycles in a woman of reproductive years, or more
objectively, a total menstrual blood loss of more than 80 ml per menstruation (Hallberg et
al, 1966).
3
ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION
3.1
Assessment of menstrual blood loss
There is poor correlation between a woman’s perception of heavy menstrual bleeding and
menstrual blood loss of more than or equal to 80 ml/cycle, and between the amount of
sanitary pads used and the complaint of heavy bleeding (Hallberg et al, 1966; Janssen et
al, 1995; level 5).
The gold standard for measuring menstrual bleeding is the alkaline haematin test, which
is not freely available in most hospitals in Malaysia, since it is currently considered as an
investigative tool for research.
A simpler alternative to this is the pictorial blood loss assessment chart, that does not
involve collection of all used sanitary material. It has also been found to correspond well
with the alkaline haematin test (Katrina et al, 2001), and has been validated to be better
than the patient’s verbal history alone (Higham et al, 1990; level 5; Janssen et al, 1995;
level 5).
3.2
Pattern of menstrual blood loss
It has been noted that while 80-90 % of women with heavy menstrual bleeding have
regular cycles, those with prolonged irregular and/or intermenstrual bleeding tend to have
other intrauterine pathology (Dijkhuizen et al, 1996; level 5). On the other hand, for perimenopausal women with delayed menstrual cycles, further investigation is only
necessary if blood loss is excessive.
3.3
Pelvic examination
An abdominal and pelvic examination to exclude obvious pelvic pathology, is advised in
all patients. The Malaysian National Cervical Screening Programme has recommended a
cervical smear be taken at the time of the pelvic examination, a pelvic ultrasound be
carried out to confirm any abnormal finding, and subsequent referral to a gynaecologist
as indicated.
3.4
Full Blood Count
Since more than two thirds of women with menstrual blood loss greater than 80 ml per
cycle have evidence of anaemia, a low haemoglobin reading is considered an objective
indicator of heavy menstrual bleeding. However, a normal haemoglobin reading does not
necessarily exclude heavy menstrual bleeding (Hallberg et al, 1966; Janssen et al, 1995;
level 5). Since the signs and symptoms of anaemia do not correlate well with the
haemoglobin level until the patient is moderately to severely anaemic, a full blood count
would assist in determining the severity of menstrual blood loss.
3.5
Thyroid function test
There is no evidence of heavy menstrual bleeding being associated with thyrotoxicosis,
but there is some evidence of association in hypothyroid patients (Krassas et al, 1994;
level 9; Attaran et al 1989). Hence, a routine thyroid function test is not recommended.
3.6
Assessment of endometrium
Endometrial pathology in pre-menopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding is
uncommon, with only 20% of cases of endometrial cancer occurring before menopause,
mostly in women are aged between 40 – 50 years (Crissman et al, 1981; level 9; Jefrery
et al, 1997; Mckenzie & Bibby, 1978, ).
Endometrial hyperplasia is associated with obesity and age, being more common in
women above 45 years of age, with a prevalence of hyperplasia of 2 – 7 % in premenopausal women (Dijkhuzen et al, 1996; level 5; Ash, Farrell & Flowerden, 1996;
level 8; Crissman et al, 1981; level 9; Farquhar, 1998). It is a precursor of endometrial
cancer, the likelihood of progression depending on the degree of hyperplasia (Ash, Farrell
& Flowerden, 1996; level 8; Farquhar, 1998; Kurman, Kaminski & Norm, 1985; level 9 ;
Terakawa, 1997; level 9; Hunter et al, 1994; level 9). Infertility and nulli-parity are also
significantly associated with hyperplasia. Women who have received tamoxifen appear to
be at increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia. However, 14% of the women diagnosed
with endometrial hyperplasia had none of the above risk factors.
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that women with
heavy menstrual bleeding but with regular cycles, aged 40 years or less, need not have
endometrial samples taken (RCOG, 1994; level 9). However, some authors suggest that
women with irregular bleeding or other risk factors for hyperplasia, should have
endometrial sampling irregardless of age (Ash, Farrell & Flowerden, 1996; level 9).
The commonly used modes of endometrial assessment are ultrasound scan, endometrial
biopsy or aspirate, hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage (D&C).
3.6.1. Ultrasound
Ultrasonography is a primary diagnostic tool in evaluating women with abnormal vaginal
bleeding, being able to demonstrate anatomic findings not frequently detected in pelvic
examination. These include small ovarian cysts, leiomyoma, endometrial carcinoma, as
well as evaluation of the endometrium with respect to thickness, which would indirectly
reflect the endometrial histology, and hormonal status of patients (Okaro, 2003).
Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) is an accurate test for diagnosing endometrial
hyperplasia when the endometrial thickness is 12 mm or more (Dijkhuizen et al, 1996;
level 5; Vercellini et al, 1997; level 5). In women more than 40 years old and who failed
medical treatment, 50% have an abnormal TVS (Nagele et al, 1996; level 5)
3.6.2. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy
Hysteroscopy allows for the examination of the whole endometrial cavity, lower segment
and cervical canal, being able to detect small polyps or sub-mucous fibroids that have
been missed by ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy or blind curettage. In women with
irregular bleeding, polyps are present in about 25 % of cases and submucous fibroids are
present in 15 – 18 % of cases (Fedele et al, 1991; level 5; Dijkhuizen et al, 1996; level 5).
Hysteroscopy with biopsy is the best diagnostic test for intrauterine pathology with high
specificity and sensitivity (Emanuel et al, 1995; level 5; Dijkhuizen et al, 1996; level 5).
Hysteroscopy alone (without biopsy) is not very accurate in diagnosing endometrial
hyperplasia and carcinoma (Widrich et al, 1996; level 9; Vercellini et al, 1997; level 5).
The main purpose of an endometrial biopsy or aspirate is to exclude endometrial
pathology like hyperplasia, endometrial disorders or malignancies. Endometrial biopsy is
a simple, quick, safe, and convenient procedure, which can be performed on an
ambulatory basis avoiding the need for anesthesia. Furthermore, the device is disposable
and is less costly than the conventional D & C.
Routine endometrial biopsy should not be an initial investigation for menorrhagia, being
indicated only if menorrhagia persists or in the presence of risk factors (RCOG, 1998,
level 9).
Pipelle and Z sampler could be used as the first line endometrial device as they have been
found to be more convenient to use compared to the Vabra aspirator (Bunkheila &
Powell, 2002). While the sample adequacy rate was similar for these 3 devices, the
Pipelle has been shown to be superior in the detection of atypical hyperplasia and
endometrial carcinoma (Dijkhuizen et al, 1996, level 5).

MANAGEMENT
4.1
Medical Treatment
4.1.1 Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
Endometrial prostaglandins are elevated with excessive menstruation, and he nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce prostaglandin levels through the
inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme with reductions in menstrual blood loss of 2535% (Irvine &, Cameron, 1999; level 9). NSAIDs are found to be less effective than
tranexamic acid or danazol, but as effective as other medical treatments (Lethaby, Irvine
& Cameron, 2003; level 1), with the added advantage of relieving dysmenorrhoea (Fraser
et al, 1981; level 3)
4.1.2 Progestogens
Progestogens administered from the fifteenth day or from 19th - 26th day of the
menstrual cycle were significantly less effective in reducing menstrual blood loss when
compared to other medical therapies (Lethaby, Irvine & Cameron, 2003; level 1), and
found to be one of the least effective agents (Roy & Bhattacharya, 2004; level 5).
However, progestogen therapy administered for 21 days of the menstrual cycle results in
a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss, (Lethaby, 2003b; level 1), although they
have been found to be ineffective unless taken at high doses (Irvine & Cameron, 1999;
level 9).
4.1.3 Combined oral contraceptive pills
The combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) in addition to providing contraception causes
a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss by regular shedding of a thinner endometrium
nd by inhibiting ovulation (Irvine & Cameron, 1999, level 9).
a
4.1.4 Danazol
Danazol is a synthetic steroid that suppresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors in the
endometrium, leading to endometrial atrophy (thinning of the lining of the uterus) and
reduced menstrual loss. It is an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.
However, its side-effect profile, its lack of acceptability to women and the need for
continuing treatment limits its use (Roy & Bhattacharya, 2004; level 5; Beaumont et al,
2003; level 1).
4.1.5 Anti-fibrinolytic agents
Tranexamic acid, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, exerts an antifibrinolytic effect through reversible blockade on plasminogen, producing a 50%
reduction in menstrual loss (Irvine & Cameron, 1999; level 9). Anti-fibrinolytic therapy
causes a greater reduction in objective measurements of heavy menstrual bleeding
compared to placebo or other medical therapies (Lethaby, Farquhar & Cooke 2003; level
1 Bonnar & Sheppard, 1996, level 1), and is not associated with an increase in side
effects (Lethaby, Farquhar & Cooke, 2003; level 1, Lindoff, Rybo & Astedt, 1997; level
5).
4.1.6 Levonorgestrel intrauterine system
The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUS) is a T shaped intrauterine device
releasing a steady amount of levonorgestrel (20µg /24 hours) from a steroid reservoir
around the vertical stem of the device. It reduces menstrual blood loss by 80% (Irvine &
Cameron, 1999; Level 9), and is found to be more effective than cyclical norethisterone,
with patients being more satisfied and willing to continue with treatment. However, these
patients experience more side effects such as inter-menstrual bleeding and breast
tenderness (Lethaby, 2003; level 1). Compared to transcervical resection of the
endometrium (TCRE), the LNG IUS produces smaller mean reduction in menstrual blood
loss, but there is no difference in the rate of satisfaction with treatment. LNG-IUS
appears equally beneficial in improving quality of life and may control bleeding as
effectively as conservative surgery over the long term (Marjoribanks, Lethaby, &
Farquhar, 2003; level 1).
4.1.7 GnRH agonists
Gonadatrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists induce a reversible hypoestrogenic
state, reducing total uterine volume. They are highly effective, but their side-effects make
them suitable only for short-term use (Irvine & Cameron, 1999, level 9).GnRH agonists
may obviate emergency surgery in patients with high surgical risk (Vercellini, 1992; level
3).
4.2
Surgical Management
4.2.1 Medical versus surgical treatment
Medical treatment for menorrhagia is not as effective as surgery despite improvement in
control of bleeding. Oral medical therapy is associated with higher incidence of side
effects, and approximately 60% of women who had medical treatment would require
surgery by 2 years. Surgery has been found to reduce menstrual bleeding more than
medical treatment at one year, although the majority of women prefer medical treatment
(Marjoribanks, Lethaby & Farquhar, 2003; level 1).
4.2.2 Dilatation and curettage
There is little evidence on the effectiveness of dilatation and curettage (D&C) for the
relief of menorrhagia. It is not cost effective for the diagnosis of endometrial malignancy
in women under 40 years since the prevalence of serious uterine conditions and
endometrial cancer is low (Coulter et al, 1993; level 9). The potential benefits need to be
weighed against the risks of anaesthesia and possible complications like uterine
perforation and laceration of the cervix (MacKenzie & Bibby, 1978; level 9). Moreover, a
significant proportion of endometrial lesions are not detected by D&C, (Vessey, Clarke,
& MacKenzie, 1979) and its usefulness as a diagnostic tool has been repeatedly
questioned. D&C may have a diagnostic role when endometrial biopsy is inconclusive
and the symptoms persist or when the underlying pathology is suspect.
4.2.3 Endometrial destruction
Endometrial destruction procedures are less invasive, more convenient and less expensive
when no other gynecological condition is involved. It enables women to avoid major
surgery and results in shorter hospital stay and convalescence. The various energy
sources used to destroy the endometrium, are all comparable in terms of efficacy, and the
re-operation rate ranges from 0 to 38.2%. The rate is higher in women under the age 35
years in studies where they have been observed for longer duration. The first-generation
techniques involve lower costs than a hysterectomy, but the second-generation
endometrial destruction techniques involve relatively high purchase and disposable
supplies costs. However, these new techniques take less time to perform and have a lower
incidence of intra-operative complications. The clinical impact of these two benefits has
yet to be demonstrated (AETMIS, 2002; level 1).
4.2.4 Hysterectomy
Hysterectomy is the most widely used treatment, and can be performed abdominally,
vaginally or laparoscopically. The vaginal and laparoscopic approaches cause fewer
complications and provide a shorter hospital stay and convalescence than abdominal
hysterectomy. Although with hysterectomy there is a permanent cessation of menstrual
flow resulting in a high level of satisfaction, it is a major invasive procedure incurring
morbidity, mortality and costs with a risk of late complications as well. (AETMIS, 2002;
level 1). Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy is associated with longer operating
times, and higher operating costs, but total costs are lower than abdominal hysterectomy.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
ASSESSMENT
1. Women should be encouraged to chart their menstrual blood loss using a pictorial
blood loss assessment chart (Grade B)
2. Women with erratic bleeding (regardless of loss) should be referred to a specialist as
endometrial pathology is likely to be present (Grade B)
INVESTIGATION
1.
Perimenopausal women with less frequent menstrual cycles but with normal blood
loss, do not require further investigation as they are not at increased risk of
intrauterine pathology. (Grade C)
2.
An abdominal and pelvic examination should be performed in women presenting
with heavy menstrual bleeding (Grade C).
3.
Full blood count should be offered to all women presenting with heavy bleeding
(Grade A).
4.
Women with heavy menstrual bleeding with severe anemia, should be referred to a
specialist for further assessment (Grade C).
5.
Thyroid function test should not be routinely performed in women with heavy
menstrual bleeding unless they have signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism (Grade
C).
6.
Transvaginal sonography, (TVS) if available, should be the first step in assessing
the endometrium (Grade B)
7.
If the endometrial thickness on TVS is more than 12 mm an endometrial sampling
should be done (Grade A)
8.
The chance of endometrial carcinoma in women less than 40 years is low and
endometrial biopsy is not warranted unless there are associated risk factors, or, if
symptoms are persistent or fail to respond to medical treatment (Grade B).
9.
Hysteroscopy with biopsy is indicated for women with erratic menstrual bleeding,
failed medical therapy, or transvaginal ultrasound suggestive of intrauterine
pathology (Grade B)
10. Hysteroscopy with biopsy is indicated in women with menorrhagia if aged more
than 40 (Grade B)
MEDICAL TREATMENT
1.
NSAIDs are effective for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding (Grade A)
2.
Progestogens given in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle are not effective in
reducing regular heavy menstrual bleeding (Grade A)
3.
Treatment with progesterone for 21 days (days 5-25) is effective in reducing
menstrual blood loss (Grade A)
4.
Oral contraceptives can be used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (Grade A)
