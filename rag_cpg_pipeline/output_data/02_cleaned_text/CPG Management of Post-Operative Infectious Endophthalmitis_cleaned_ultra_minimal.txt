GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVE
Guideline Development
Post-operative endophthalmitis, though infrequent, remains a serious and
blinding complication following intraocular surgery. However, variations in
the management of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis still exist
amongst ophthalmologists in Malaysia. This national guideline has been
compiled by a committee comprising of ophthalmologists, a pharmacist
and a nursing officer from the public and private sector. It aims to present
evidence-based recommendations as a guide for the prophylaxis and
management of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis.
Relevant key words ‘post-operative endophthalmitis’, ‘endophthalmitis’,
‘endophthalmitis AND causative organism’, ‘endophthalmitis AND
prophylaxis’, ‘endophthalmitis AND infection control’, ‘endophthalmitis AND
clinical features’, ‘endophthalmitis AND management’ were used to generate
literature from the following databases (PubMed), Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews and
Cochrane Controlled Trial Register via OVID search engine. Searches
were also manually done in non-indexed journals and “grey literature”.
Existing guideline, mainly the ESCRS Guidelines on prevention,
investigation and management of post-operative endophthalmitis was
included as reference. The experience and knowledge of the CPG
development group was also considered when formulating the guideline.
Assessment of the evidence was conducted independently by individual
members and discussed as a group before decisions were made. In each
area considered, the best evidence available was given more weightage.
Less well designed studies were either merely mentioned or excluded unless
they added a different perspective. Related articles were selected and out
of these, relevant articles were chosen and graded using the modified
version of the Catalonian Agency for Health Technology Assessment and
Research (CAHTAR) model. The grading of recommendations was modified
from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN).
Objective
To provide guidelines to ophthalmic surgeons in the prophylaxis and
treatment of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis based on best
available evidence.

INTRODUCTION
Post-operative infectious endophthalmitis is an infrequent but
devastating complication of ophthalmic surgery. Its occurrence can
lead to poor visual prognosis, and increase in health care cost. The
rate of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis therefore is frequently
used as an indicator for quality assurance of ophthalmology services.
It is currently used as one of the national indicator approaches (NIA)
in the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH).
1.1 Definition
For practical purposes, post-operative infectious endophthalmitis
is defined as intraocular inflammation caused by an infective
process following intraocular surgery. Intra-ocular surgery is
defined as any ocular surgery where the full thickness of the
cornea and / or sclera has been breached. This definition
excludes patients with penetrating eye injury.
Acute infectious endophthalmitis usually presents within two
weeks of surgery, whereas chronic infectious endophthalmitis
usually present a few weeks or months following surgery.
1.2 Magnitude of Problem
Over the past decades, the incidence of post-operative infectious
endophthalmitis has shown a decline due to improvements in
surgical techniques and instrumentation. Emphasis on sterility
and prophylactic measures may also have a role in this decline.
The incidence of post-operative endophthalmitis ranges from
0.07% (1, Level 8; 2, Level 8) to 1.8% (3, Level 8). Incidence rates differ with
the type of surgery. Cataract surgery, being the most commonly
performed ocular surgery, is the most common type of surgery
preceding endophthalmitis, with incidences ranging from 0.07%
to 0.13% (4, Level 8). The incidence following specific type of surgery
was : secondary intraocular lens (IOL) 0.30% to 0.40 %, extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with or without IOL
implantation 0.072% to 0.18%, phacoemulsification 0.015% to
0.5%, penetrating keratoplasty 0.11 % to 0.18%, glaucoma
filtering surgery 0.06% to 1.8%, pars plana vitrectomy 0.046% to
0.07%, combined trabeculectomy and cataract surgery 0.11%,
combined penetrating keratoplasty and cataract surgery 0.19%
(4, Level 9, 5 Level 8 ).
In Malaysia, the rates of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis
following all intraocular surgery in MOH hospitals ranged from
0% to 1.13%, with a mean of 0.26 % for 2 consecutive years
(2003 and 2004) and a mean of 0.18% for the year 2005
(Unpublished data, Annual MOH census).
The rate following cataract surgery based on the National Cataract
Surgery Registry of MOH hospitals was 0.19% in 2002, 0.24% in
2003 and 0.16% in 2004 (6, Level 9 ; 7, Level 9; 8, Level 9 ).
1.3 Causative Organism
The microbial spectrum seen in post-operative endophthalmitis
depends on various factors including environmental, geographic
climatic conditions as well as types of surgery.

1.4 Risk Factors
The source of infection following intraocular surgery include lids,
adnexa, ocular tear film, respiratory and skin flora of the surgeons
and assistants, surgical instruments including IOL, irrigating
solutions and operating room air (9, Level 1). As sterile surgical
technique addresses many of these factors, the common sources
of pathogens are thus from ocular surface and adnexa (10, Level 2; 11,
Level 8).
Table 2 : General Risk Factors
Preoperative risk factors include presence of blepharitis,
conjunctivitis, dacryocystitis, lacrimal duct obstruction, contact
lens wear, and ocular prosthesis in the fellow orbit (12, Level 9)
Intra-operative risk factors include inadequate eyelid and
conjunctival disinfection (13, Level 7), inadequate draping of lid and
lashes (14, Level 9), prolonged surgery (13, Level 7) and presence of intraoperative complications (15, Level 7)
Post-operative risk factors include wound leak and wound
dehiscence, inadequately buried sutures, suture removal,
vitreous incarceration in the surgical wound and occurrence of
filtering bleb (4, Level 9)
Host immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus (16, Level 7; 1 Level 8, 17, Level 2)
Presence of atopic dermatitis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (18, Level 9)
Patient on topical or systemic immunosuppressive drugs such
as corticosteroid and antimetabolites (19, Level 7)
Respiratory and skin flora of the surgeons and assistants (9 , Level 1)

compared to extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) (5, Level 8)
ECCE has higher risk when compared to phacoemulsification
(20, Level 8)

scleral tunnel incision (22, Level 8; 23, Level 2)
The risk is higher with longer duration of surgery (13, Level7)
Occurrence of posterior capsular rupture and vitreous loss, as
well as performance of anterior vitrectomy is associated with
higher risk ( 5, Level 8; 15, Level 6; 20, Level 8; 24, Level 8; 25, Level 8)

PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES
The low incidence of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis makes
it difficult to assess accurately the efficacy of preventive measures.
Many studies either have low statistical power in assessing the
influence of a change in procedure on the incidence of post-operative
endophthalmitis, or measure surrogate outcomes such as change in
conjunctival flora or aqueous bacterial counts. In addition, most of
the studies on prophylaxis were related to cataract surgery and thus
its application to other forms of ocular surgeries may not apply.
As the ocular surface is a common source of pathogens (10, Level 2; 11, Level 8)
various measures have been used to prepare the ocular surface
before surgery to reduce normal ocular surface flora.
2.1 Antiseptic Measures
a.
Preoperative povidone iodine on skin and conjunctival sac
Povidone iodine 5% solution has been shown to decrease the
number of colonies isolated from the conjunctiva by 91% and
decrease the number of species by 50%. (9, Level I; 31, Level 3; 32, Level 7; 33,
Level 7; 34, Level 7; 35, Level 4; 36, Level 8; 37, Level 8). Instillation of topical 5%
povidone iodine solution into the conjunctival sac just before
surgery significantly reduced the incidence of culture positive
endophthalmitis as compared to silver nitrate solution (38, Level 4; 9,
Level I). Even when used at 1.25% preoperatively, topical povidone
iodine has shown a significant reduction in the conjunctival
bacterial counts (39, Level 4).
Its application to the eye at the end of surgery has also been
shown to be effective in reducing conjunctival bacterial flora and
was in fact more effective when compared to topical broad
spectrum antibiotics (40, Level 7).
However, on the basis of available clinical studies, only povidone
iodine in a concentration of 5% in balanced salt solution (BSS)
or isotonic saline can be recommended as the preoperative
antiseptic of choice (26, Level 9). Chlorhexidine 0.05% should be used as
the alternative in patients who are allergic to povidone iodine (26, Level 9).
The use of povidone iodine was not associated with significant
adverse reactions (38, Level 4).
b.
Draping of periorbital area
Inadequate draping of the periorbital areas with exposed lids and
lashes to the surgical site might be a possible risk factor (14, Level 9).
c.
Trimming of eyelash
Preoperative trimming of eyelashes is not associated with a
reduction of risk of post-operative endophthalmitis (22, Level 8; 9, Level 1).
d.
Preoperative irrigation of lacrimal passages
Preoperative irrigation of the lacrimal passages has no significant
effect as prophylactic measure (9, Level 1).
e.
Preoperative saline irrigation of conjunctival sac
Saline irrigation of conjunctival sac did not reduce the bacterial
flora (9, Level 1; 34, Level 4).
2.2 Antibiotics Prophylaxis
a.
Intracameral antibiotic
i.
Intracameral injection of cefuroxime at the end of surgery
Intracameral injection of 1mg cefuroxime in 0.1 ml at the end of
phacoemulsification surgery has been shown to significantly
reduce the risk of post-operative endophthalmitis up to five folds
in a multicenter European study (41, Level 2). This prophylactic
measure has been adopted by all Swedish cataract surgeons (42,
Level 7). Refer Appendix 4 for the dilution of intracameral cefuroxime.
Careful dilution should be undertaken to ensure its safe use and
to prevent potential toxicity.
ii.
Intracameral irrigation of antibiotic through addition of
vancomycin into irrigating solution
Anterior chamber contamination at the end of cataract surgery
varies from 0.18% to 13.7% (26, Level 9; 43, Level 8). Although some
studies evaluating intraocular fluid contamination have shown
that irrigating solution with vancomycin have reduced positive
aqueous cultures (44, Level 9; 45, Level 8; 46, Level 2), whether the reduction is
meaningful remains doubtful (26, Level 9). Furthermore, it has been
shown that exposure to an antibiotic for a short duration during
intraocular surgery has little effect on organisms commonly
responsible for endophthalmitis (47, Level 9). As its use can cause
retinal toxicity from inadvertent dilution error including irreversible
macular infarct, as well as resulting in antibiotic resistance, it is
generally not recommended (48, Level 9; 49, Level 9; 50, Level 9).
b.
Preoperative topical antibiotic
There is insufficient evidence to show that the use of preoperative
topical antibiotic significantly reduces the risk of post-operative
infectious endophthalmitis (9, Level 1; 41, Level 2).
c. Preoperative systemic antibiotic
Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is not proven to be of benefit
in preventing post-operative endophthalmitis (26, Level 9).
d. Post-operative subconjunctival antibiotic injection
Sub-conjunctival antibiotic injection at the conclusion of surgery
does not appear to prevent post-operative endophthalmitis (22, Level 9).
2.3 Heparinized Intraocular Infusion Solution and Heparin
Coated IOL
Heparin coats the lens and intraocular surface and thus prevent
bacterial adherence (51, Level 9). However there is no sufficient
evidence to indicate benefits of both heparinized irrigating solution
and heparin coated IOL in preventing post-operative infectious
endophthalmitis (52, Level 3).
2.4 Operating Theatre
a.
Air flow design
There are no current guidelines for the type of airflow best required
to prevent post-operative infectious endophthalmitis for
intraocular surgery. The ideal type of airflow system is being
investigated by the ESCRS multi-centre study on endophthalmitis
after phacoemulsification surgery (26, Level 9)..
b.
Equipment sterilization
All equipment for surgery should be sterile. Care is required with
both washing and autoclaving the instruments. It is preferable
that tubing that becomes wet within the operative procedure
should not be reused. Bottles of balanced salt solution (BSS)
should never be kept overnight or used for more than one
operating session. Operating theatre trolleys must be kept dry
as wet areas are easily contaminated with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (26, Level 9).
Further details of prophylactic measures are given in Appendix 1.
Recommendations for prophylaxis
Use of povidone iodine 5% as an antiseptic agent for preparation of
skin and conjunctival sac preoperatively is recommended. (Grade A)
Proper draping of the eyelid margin using an adhesive non porous drape
and the use of speculum to cover all the eyelashes is recommended.
(Grade C)
Intracameral injection of 1 mg cefuroxime in 0.1ml at the end of surgery
is recommended. Careful dilution should be undertaken to prevent
potential toxicity.
(Grade A)
3.
DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery and who develop
the following clinical features should be assessed and monitored
closely. Prompt management with intravitreal tap and intravitreal
antibiotic injection should be performed in clinically suspected cases
of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis.
3.1 Clinical Features
a.
Acute post-operative endophthalmitis
The symptoms and signs may include the following:
-
Ocular pain (74-85%) (53, Level 2; 16, Level 7; 26, Level 9; 50, Level 9)
-
Reduced vision (>90%) (53, Level 2; 16, Level 7 ; 50, Level 9; 26, Level 9)
-
Swollen lids (35%) (54, Level 8; 50, Level 9)
-
Inflamed or oedematous conjunctiva (>80%) (54, Level 8; 50, Level 9;
26, Level 9)
-
Discharge into conjunctiva (26, Level 9; 50, Level 9)
-
Corneal oedema (26, Level 9, 50, Level 9)
-
Cloudy anterior chamber with cells, hypopyon or fibrin (7585%) (54, Level 8; 26 , Level 9; 50, Level 9)
-
Vitreous clouding (vitritis) (26, Level 9; 50, Level 9 )
-
Involvement of posterior segment with retinitis, and/or retinal
periphlebitis, retinal oedema and papillary oedema (26, Level 9; 50, Level 9)
Involvement of posterior segment is virtually always accompanied
by severe anterior segment inflammation.
b.
Chronic post-operative infectious endophthalmitis
Patients may present with any of the symptoms and signs of
acute post-operative endophthalmitis. Features include:
-
Corneal oedema (55, Level 8)
-
Mutton fat keratic precipitates on IOL or corneal endothelium
(4, Level 9)
-
Persistent low grade uveitis that may respond to
corticosteroids initially ( typical) (4, Level 9)
-
Hypopyon – sometimes so small that it can only be visible
with gonioscopy, or recurrent hypopyon that fails to respond
to corticosteroid (4, Level 9; 26,level 9)
-
White ‘string-of-pearl’ infiltrate in the anterior chamber and
vitreous are sometimes seen in fungal infections (4, Level 9)
-
Plaque located on the posterior capsule, IOL or retained
lens particles (40-89%) (56, Level 9; 57, Level 9; 4, Level 9)
-
Vitreous clouding (vitritis) from chronic inflammation (4, Level
9; 26, Level 9)
3.2 Investigations
When a clinical diagnosis of acute or chronic post-operative
infectious endophthalmitis is made, a vitreous tap should be
performed within ONE hour after clinical diagnosis, together
with administration of an intravitreal antibiotic injection (26, Level 9).
Anterior chamber tap is helpful in the identification of the causative
organism as some organisms grow from the aqueous but not
from the vitreous sample.
Aqueous and vitreous specimens should be sent for gram stain,
culture and sensitivity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods
offer much improved pathogen detection especially in the case
of chronic endophthalmitis with low pathogen counts (58, Level 8)
.
However, due to its high sensitivity, problems with availability and
the risk of contamination, its use as routine diagnostic test is
limited (26, Level 9).
Vitreous biopsy has not been shown to have better microbial
yield as compared to vitreous tap (59, Level 2).
Conjunctival and corneal swabs are usually not helpful in isolating
the causative microorganisms (38, Level 4).
Refer Appendix 2 for the performance of anterior chamber tap,
vitreous tap and intravitreal antibiotic injection.
4.
TREATMENT
There is variation in the treatment of post-operative infectious
endophthalmitis and the treatment approach is usually based on
institutional protocol.
4.1 Treatment
of
Acute
Post-operative
Infectious
Endophthalmitis
a.
Antimicrobial therapy
i.
Intravitreal antibiotics
Intravitreal antibiotics should be given as soon as possible after
clinical diagnosis has been made (4, Level 9; 26, Level 9; 50, Level 9). This
should be preceded by intravitreal tap. Intravitreal antibiotic may
be repeated as necessary judging by the clinical response, usually
at an interval of 48-72 hours (50, Level 9). The time interval for repeat
intravitreal antibiotic depends on the half-life of the antibiotic used.
A combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics covering both gram
positive and negative organism is used. The choice of antibiotics
should be reviewed following the culture and sensitivity results.
The commonly used antibiotic combinations are:
-
Vancomycin (2mg in 0.1ml) AND Ceftazidime (2mg in 0.1ml)
(60, Level 2; 4, Level 8; 61, Level 9) OR
-
Vancomycin (2mg in 0.1ml) AND Amikacin (0.4mg in 0.1ml)
(4, Level 8; 53, Level 2)
Ceftazidime is preferred over amikacin in view of amikacin related
retinal toxicity (53, level 2; 62, level 9; 48, Level 9; 4, Level 9).
Patient’s clinical progress should be observed and monitored
closely. Early referral for a vitreoretinal opinion after intravitreal
antibiotic injection is recommended.
Refer Appendix 3 for the preparation of intravitreal drugs using
aseptic technique.
ii.
Topical and subconjunctival injection of antibiotic
The aim of topical and subconjunctival injection of broad spectrum
antibiotics use is to treate possible ocular surface and anterior
segment infection. Topical ceftazidime (5% or 50mg/ml), topical
vancomycin (5% or 50mg/ml) or other broad spectrum antibiotics
eye drops are used, either as monotherapy or combined therapy,
hourly round the clock initially with subsequent tapering according
to clinical response (50, Level 9). Subconjunctival injection of antibiotic
can be used together with intravitreal antibiotics in the treatment
of post-operative endophthalmitis. This is done in the hope of
achieving higher concentration of antibiotics around the eye and
in the anterior chamber, especially when the frequent round the
clock instillation of topical antibiotics at the initial period is not
possible (4, Level 9). When giving subconjunctival antibiotic,
subconjunctival mydricane can be given to get pupillary dilatation
which helps the movement of antibiotic around the eye.
iii.
Systemic antimicrobial therapy
The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study concluded that systemic
ceftazidime and amikacin did not have any effect on the course
and outcome of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery (53, Level 2).
In cases of severe, virulent endophthalmitis, systemic intravenous
antibiotics of the same choice as intravitreal antibiotics should
be given (4, Level 9). Alternatively, oral moxifloxacin (400mg daily for
10 days) or oral ciprofloxacin (750mg bd for 14 days) can be
given. However, systemic fluoroquinolones are to be used with
caution in children (50, Level 9).
Oral clarithromycin (500mg bd for 2 weeks) is recommended for
patients with acute post-operative endophthalmitis with a culture
negative eye (66, Level 8; 67, Level 8). It acts as a biofilm reducing agent to
enhance the efficacy of cefuroxime, ceftazidime and amikacin.
In view of a high incidence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, fourth
generation fluoroquinolones, oral moxifloxacin (400mg daily for
10 days) has been used (65, Level 9). In addition, moxifloxacin has
an anti-biofilm effect on coagulase- negative staphylococci, which
are one of the commonest infecting organisms following cataract
surgery. Besides, moxifloxacin has also been shown to have
better penetration to inflamed ocular tissue (68, Level 9; 69, 2006, Level 8).
This may therefore improve the ocular prognosis. When oral
moxifloxacin is used, the use of oral clarithromycin is not indicated
(65, Level 9).
b.
Anti-inflammatory therapy
There is limited evidence on the efficacy of intravitreal and
periocular corticosteroids in the treatment of post-operative
infectious endophthalmitis. While intravitreal dexamethasone
reduces early inflammation in bacterial endophthalmitis, it has
no independent influence on the visual outcome (63, Level 8; 64, Level 8).
Intensive topical prednisolone acetate 1% or dexamethasone 1%
every 1 to 2 hours is recommended to control anterior chamber
inflammation. Its use should begin soon after intravitreal injection
of antibiotics (65, Level 9).
Oral prednisolone one day after intra-vitreal antibiotic therapy
has not been shown to have any negative effect on the course of
infection in bacterial endophthalmitis (53, Level 2). It may be used in
those who have no contraindications for corticosteroid (50, Level 9; 65,
Level 9). The dosage of oral prednisolone is 1 mg/kg/day, to be
tapered by 10mg each week for a total duration of up to 3 weeks
(65, Level 9). Tablet ranitidine is prescribed simultaneously for gastric
protection. Patients with fungal endophthalmitis should not be
given prednisolone.
c.
Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA)
TPA has only been reported to be useful as adjunctive therapy in
animal studies and in a small case series of endophthalmitis with
severe fibrinous anterior chamber reaction (70, Level 9; 71, Level 9; 72, Level 9).
There is insufficient evidence for its routine use for both acute
and chronic post-operative endophthalmitis. However,
intracameral injection of 25 mg in 0.1 ml is recommended in
patients with severe fibrinous anterior chamber reactions
particularly in eyes with pupils that do not dilate with mydriatics.
d.
Vitrectomy
According to Endopthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS), routine
immediate vitrectomy is not necessary in patients with better than
light perception vision at presentation but is of substantial benefit
for those who have light perception- only vision (53, level 2; 73, Level 9).
However, limitations of EVS leave this conclusion open to future
modification (26, Level 9; 74, Level 9).
Refer algorithm for the management of acute post-operative endophthalmitis
13
Recommendation for treatment of acute post-operative
endophthalmitis
Intravitreal antibiotic should be given within 1 hour of diagnosis and
repeated when necessary.
(Grade C)
Intensive topical antibiotic and steroid should be given round the clock
initially.
(Grade C)
Subconjunctival antibiotic is given when indicated.
(Grade C)
The use of oral or intravenous antibiotics is recommended for
endophthalmitis patients with virulent infection.
(Grade C)
Systemic corticosteroid may be given.
(Grade C)
Oral clarithromycin (500mg bd for 2 weeks) is recommended in culture
negative cases with poor clinical response.
(Grade C)
Intracameral tissue plasminogen activator (25mg in 0.1ml) is
recommended in patients with severe anterior chamber reaction.
(Grade C)
Vitrectomy may have a role in improving prognosis. Therefore, early
referral for a vitreoretinal opinion is recommended.
(Grade C)
Vitrectomy with or without silicone oil tamponade has been shown
in recent case series, to increase the chance of surgical success
and decrease the number of additional procedures in eyes with
post-operative infectious endophthalmitis (75, Level 7).
4.2 Treatment of Chronic Post-operative Infectious
Endophthalmitis
a.
Antimicrobial therapy
Intravitreal antibiotic is given to all patients with chronic postoperative endophthalmitis. The choice of intravitreal antibiotic is
similar to that in acute post-operative endophthalmitis (76, Level 6; 4,
Level 9).
The decision to use topical and systemic antimicrobials in chronic
post-operative infectious endophthalmitis is the same as that for
acute post-operative infectious endophthalmitis (26, Level 9).
For suspected fungal endophthalmitis, intravitreal amphotericin
B (5ug or 10ug in 0.1ml) has been proven to be effective.
Intravitreal miconazole (0.01mg in 0.1ml) should be considered
for fungi resistant to amphotericin B (76, level 9; 4, Level 9).
Combined systemic therapy with amphotericin B and imidazole
is effective in infection with Fusarium sp. whereas voriconazole
or fluconazole is effective for Candida albicans. Itraconazole
can be used for other Candida species, Aspergillus or
Cryptococcus (77, Level 9).
The indication for he use of systemic clarithromycin is as per
acute post-operative endophthalmitis (66, Level 8; 67, Level 8; 26, level 9).
b.
Vitrectomy
There is insufficient evidence for or against vitrectomy in the
treatment of chronic post-operative endophthalmitis. However,
in cases of suspected or confirmed Propionebacterium acnes or
fungal endophthalmitis following cataract surgery, removal of IOL
and posterior lens capsule with vitrectomy should be considered
(4, Level 9; 18, Level 9).
Refer algorithm for the management of chronic post-operative endophthalmitis
5. CLINICAL AUDIT INDICATOR
The incidence rate of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis should be
monitored as a performance indicator by all ophthalmic facilities. Currently
data from MOH hospitals are being collected by the ophthalmology service,
MOH.
15
Recommendation for treatment of chronic post-operative
endophthalmitis
Intravitreal antibiotic should be given promptly.
(Grade C)
Intravitreal amphotericin B (5ug or 10ug in 0.1ml) is to be given if fungal
endophthalmitis is suspected.
(Grade C)
Topical antibiotics and steroid should be given.
(Grade C)
Systemic anti-fungals to be given when indicated.
(Grade C)
The use of oral or intravenous antibiotics is indicated in patients with
severe endophthalmitis.

Oral clarithromycin (500mg bd for 2 weeks) is recommended in culture
negative cases with poor clinical response.
(Grade C)
Intracameral tissue plasminogen activator (25mg in 0.1ml) is
recommended in patients with severe anterior chamber reaction.
(Grade C)
Early referral for vitreoretinal consultation is recommended. (Grade C)

Appendix 1
PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES
1.
Careful preoperative assessment of patients
1.1. Treat patients who have predisposing risk factors such as eyelid
infection, conjunctivitis, dacryocystitis and nasolacrimal duct
obstruction.
1.2. Optimize patients’ medical conditions, which may affect wound healing
such as diabetes mellitus and anemia.
2.
Proper scrubbing of eyebrow, upper and lower eyelids, eyelashes, adjacent
forehead, nose, cheek and temporal orbital areas with 5% povidone iodine*.
Use chlorhexidine 0.05% as an alternative in patients who are allergic to
povidone iodine.
3.
Apply 5% povidone iodine to the conjunctival sac before surgery begins.
4.
Proper draping of eyelid margins, and with proper use of speculum to tuck
in all eyelashes under the non porous adhesive drape.
5.
Ensure sterility of surgical instrument especially the microsurgical
instruments that enter the eyes. Only use properly sterilized micro
instruments.
6.
Avoid soaking of instruments.
7.
For cataract surgery
7.1. Avoid unnecessary contact of IOL on possible areas of contamination
including ocular surface.
7.2. Use of injector for foldable lens is preferred.
7.3. Do not share viscoelastic material between patients.
7.4. Ensure incision is water tight at the end of surgery.
7.5. Consider intracameral injection of 1mg cefuroxime in 0.1 ml at the
end of surgery. Careful dilution must be undertaken to prevent potential
toxicity.
8.
Replenishment of analgesic, steroid and antibiotic eye drops used in the
OT at regular intervals to prevent contamination. Label date of opening on
new bottles.
9.
Careful post-operative monitoring for high risk patients.
*Preparation of 5% povidone iodine is done with 1:1 dilution of the 10% solution
with sterile balanced salt solution (BSS) or isotonic saline. It should be prepared
on the day of surgery. The use of a large bottle of readily diluted povidone iodine
or chlorhexidine should be avoided as both antiseptics can become contaminated
with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Povidone iodine solution containing detergent
must NOT be used as it coagulates the cornea irreversibly (26, level 9).
Appendix 2
