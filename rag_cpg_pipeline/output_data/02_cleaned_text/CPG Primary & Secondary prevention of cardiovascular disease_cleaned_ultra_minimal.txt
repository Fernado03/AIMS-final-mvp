STATEMENT OF INTENT
This guideline was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the
prevention of cardiovascular disease, based on the best available evidence at the
time of development. Specific attempts were made to use local data and
publications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not
necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care as this
depends on other clinical factors like co-morbidities, acceptance of patients towards
recommended therapy etc. Every health care provider is responsible to individualise
the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation and
management options available locally.
REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE
This guideline is issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in 2022 or earlier if important
new evidence becomes available.

Disease 2017
MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH
Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) has been the leading
cause of death in Malaysian since the early 1980s. The
National Burden of Disease Study in early 2000s showed
that coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular
disease (CVA) are the top two causes of death for both
men and women. What is of concern is that the age of
onset of CVD in Malaysia is younger compared to
our neighbors and some western nations.
Equally of concern is that the incidence of the major risk factors contributing to CVD
has shown an increasing trend over the last 3 decades. The Ministry of Health
(MOH) in conjunction with the Academy of Medicine and Professional Non-Governmental Organisations had since the mid-1990s had published Clinical Practice
Guidelines (CPGs) on the Management of major risk factors for CVD. This is
followed by CPGs on the Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure
and Cerebrovascular Accidents. More recently, in 2010, the MOH launched the
National Strategic Plan for Non-Communicable Disease (NSP-NCD) in response to
the global challenge in combatting NCD in general and CVD in particular. This
document is now being updated by the MOH to reflect latest developments in the
field and more current global targets set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
What has been missing thus far is an integrated approach to combat CVD at both
the primary and secondary prevention levels. This is where this pioneering CPG on
Prevention of CVD is a most welcome addition to compliment earlier initiatives to
confront the scourge of CVD. The integrated approach adopted in this CPG engaging a wide spectrum of health care professionals (from dieticians to clinicians) is
most commendable. It is my wish that this CPG is widely available and adopted by
all health care professionals involved in the management of CVD. I strongly believe
that, God Willing, compliance to the recommendation made in this CPG will go a
long way to improve the quality of care we offer to reverse the rising tide of this
preventable disease.

Disease 2017
RATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT
Rationale:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
Malaysia. The National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS) have shown that the
prevalence
of
the
cardiovascular
(CV)
risk
factors
–
hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, overweight/obesity and smoking – has been on an
increasing trend. The National Cardiovascular Disease – Acute Coronary Syndrome
(NCVD-ACS) Registry has also shown that Malaysians are developing heart disease
at a younger age than that seen in the neighbouring countries.
This Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease, 1ST Edition, is timely. It is directed at both individuals with and without
established CVD. It has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National
Heart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy of
Medicine. It comprises of cardiologists, endocrinologists, general and family
physicians and physicians from the MOH, Public Health Division, government and
private hospitals and the universities.
Objectives:
The objectives of this CPG are to:
•
Look critically at the available evidence on the effectiveness of strategies for
the primary and secondary prevention of CVD.
•
Educate healthcare workers on methods of assessing and stratifying CV risk in
our local population.
•
Suggest appropriate preventive steps against CVD at the individual, community
and governmental level.
Process:
A review of current medical literature on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention for the
last 10 years was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following
electronic databases – PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews.The
search was conducted for the period January 2006 till 31st August 2016. Literature
search was carried out using the following electronic databases – PubMed and
Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. The following MeSH terms or free text
terms were used either singly or in combination:
“Primary Prevention of Heart Attacks/stroke”, “Secondary Prevention of Heart
Attacks/strokes”, “Dietary therapy for prevention of cardiovascular disease”;
Physical Activity for primary prevention; Physical activity for secondary prevention;
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Obstructive sleep apnoea for prevention of heart attack/stroke”; “Hypertension and
prevention of cardiovascular disease” Erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular
disease”; “Combined oral contraceptives”, “Hormone replacement therapy”;
The search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and
published in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from
this huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were
searched to identify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the
field were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines
mainly that from the American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology
(AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main
references.
All literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all
statements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The
grading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted
from the AHA/ACC and the ESC (pg 14).
After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical
Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health
personnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector for review and
feedback.
Clinical Questions Addressed:
•
How common are the CV risk factors in Malaysia?
•
How cost effective is CVD prevention?
•
What are the types of CVD one should target for prevention?
 What are the risk factors?
 Are there any other conditions/risk markers beyond the traditional risk
factors?
•
How do you assess CV risk for:
 Primary prevention?
 Secondary prevention?
•
What steps should be taken to prevent CV risk at the:
 Individual level?
 Community, population and governmental level?
Target Group:
These guidelines are directed at all healthcare providers – all medical practitioners,
allied health personnel, traditional and complementary medicine practitioners.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Target Population:
These guidelines are developed to prevent CVD (heart disease and strokes) in all
individuals.
Period of Validity of the Guidelines:
These guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with
recent developments and knowledge regarding preventive strategies against CVD.
Implementation of the Guidelines:
The implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical
governance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:
•
Increasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the
importance of knowing their individual CV risk.
•
Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on CV risk
assessment tools and the implementation of appropriate preventative
strategies depending on each individual’s CV risk status. This can be done by
road shows, electronic media, in-house training sessions.
•
Performance measures that include:
 Achieving of NCD Targets (Section 14, pg 133)
 Hospital admissions and discharges
 Periodic national health surveys
 Mortality statistics
 Burden of disease studies conducted every 10 years
Facilitators, Barriers and Resource Implications
In the prevention of CVD, the emphasis is on lifestyle measures and the use of
medications that are already available in the hospitals of the Ministry of Health. It
however entails:
•
Education of the healthcare providers on:
 What constitutes a healthy diet
 How to teach simple practical exercises that even a busy/elderly person
can perform. These simple exercises should be tailored to the physical
capabilities of the individual.
 Where to go if individuals want help to quit smoking
 Practical tips on losing weight and where to refer overweight/obese
invididuals with co morbidities
Although there a number of strategies to prevent /reduce the burden of
Non-Communicable Diseases being undertaken at the governmental level, there are
problems of implementation. (e.g. no smoking in areas gazetted as NO Smoking
Areas) This has to be overcome by education beginning from the young in schools
and also via the mass media. Occasionally legislation and penalty may be
necessary.

SUMMARY
Magnitude of the problem:
•
The prevalence of the common CV risk factors (Hypertension, smoking,
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, overweight and obesity) in Malaysia is high and
shows a rising trend.
Prevention- Primary and Secondary
•
Prevention of CVD includes:
 Primary prevention strategies directed at:
o Healthy general population – Section 3
o Individuals with multiple CV risk factors or very high levels of a
single CV risk factor – Section 4
o Individuals who are at high risk for a CV event – Section 5 & 6
 Secondary prevention strategies directed at individuals who:
o Have established CVD.
•
CVD includes:
 Coronary heart disease (CHD)
 Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
 Peripheral artery disease (PAD)
 Asymptomatic individuals with:
o “Silent” myocardial ischemia (MI) detected by non-invasive testing.
o Significant atheromatous plaques in any vascular tree detected by
imaging.
•
CV risk factors may be:
 Non-modifiable – increasing age, gender, family history of premature
CVD, ethnicity.
 Modifiable – diet and dietary patterns, smoking, physical inactivity,
obesity/overweight, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes/diabetes.
•
In addition, there are other conditions associated with increased CV risk. Risk
markers may also be used to indicate individuals who are at higher risk for a CV
event.
•
In primary prevention, the committee advocates:
 Screening at >30 years of age. (Section 3.2, pg 31)
 Opportunistic rather than mass screening.
 The use of the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) General CVD Risk Score to
assess future CV risk (Tables 1-3, pg 18-20, Appendix 2, pg 166-167)
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Intensifying risk factor reduction efforts and treatment goals
•
Treatment targets will depend on the individual’s CV risk (Table 3, pg 20)
•
Individuals who at Very High and High CV risk (Table 3, pg 20) include those
who:
 Have established CVD (secondary prevention)
 Multiple CV risk factors – 10 year risk of a CV event >20%
 At high risk for a CV Event – e.g. chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes
•
In these individuals, all risk factors should be treated intensively to target
levels via lifestyle modification and drug therapy as indicated, in accordance
with the respective CPGs. (Table 4, pg 21)
•
In individuals at Low to Intermediate (Moderate) CV risk the emphasis is on
lifestyle modification to achieve targets.
Management – General measures
•
Nutrition – A diet high in fibre, fruits and vegetable, wholegrain, low in salt and
saturated/trans-fat is associated with lower CV risk. A healthy food portion
recommendation is the #QuarterQuarterHalf plate (Tables 5 & 6, pg 22-23)
•
Physical activity (PA):
 Any amount of PA is better than none.
 Regular PA reduces all causes and CV mortality.
•
Smoking:
 Is an independent and strong risk factor for CVD.
 There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.
 Smoking should be strongly discouraged and individuals referred to the
MQuit services.
•
Overweight and obesity
 Overweight and obese individuals should be counselled on lifestyle
changes that can produce at least a 5-10% weight loss. (Appendix 10,
pg 175)
 A small 3-5% weight loss itself is associated with a clinically significant
reduction in CVD risk factors – blood pressure (BP), blood glucose and
lipid.
 Bariatric surgery may be considered as a treatment option for obesity if
body mass index (BMI):
o >35 kg/m2 with or without co-morbidities.
o >32 kg/m2 with co-morbidities.
o >30 kg/m2 if central obesity + 2 CV risk factors.
 Bariatric surgery has been shown to improve CV risk factors in the short
term. There is a reduction in CV events and mortality during long term
follow up.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
•
At present, national policies are mainly directed at tobacco control, salt
reduction and modifying the obesogenic environment.
Treatment of individual risk factors (Table 4, pg 21)
•
Treating BP and lipids (particularly low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C))
to the recommended targets have been consistently shown to reduce CVD.
•
Good glycemic control reduces the risk of microvascular diseases (retinopathy,
nephropathy) in the short term and reduces CV events (MI and CV mortality) in
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during long term follow up (Legacy effect). In
patients with CVD, the newer diabetic medications have shown to cause a
reduction in composite CV events.
Antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy
•
Antiplatelet therapy:
 Primary prevention- not routinely recommended.
 Secondary prevention:
o After an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), dual antiplatelet therapy is
indicated for at least a year followed by antiplatelet monotherapy
irrespective of whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with
stenting or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) was performed.
o Established CHD >1 year: antiplatelet monotherapy indefinitely.
o Following a stroke or TIA, antiplatelet monotherapy indefinitely.
•
Anticoagulant therapy:
 Anticoagulation with either warfarin or the newer oral anticoagulants
(NOACs) for the prevention of stroke is indicated in individuals with:
o Atrial fibrillation
o Left ventricular (LV) thrombus demonstrated by echocardiogram and
an established stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
Adherence
•
Full adherence to therapy proven to reduce CVD (aspirin, BP and cholesterol
lowering drugs) has been estimated to reduce the risk of the first or second
CVD event by approximately 80%.
Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM)
•
Herbal medicine, acupuncture and other forms of T&CM should be used with
caution in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
1. Introduction
1.1
Epidemiology of Cardiovascular Disease
CVD is the main cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disease related
disability.1,2 In Malaysia, CVD has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
for more than a decade.1–5
There is limited data on the exact prevalence of CVD locally. The data available is
from the NCVD-ACS Registry. This is a voluntary registry of patients admitted with
ACS to public and private hospitals. Data from the 2011-2013 registry indicated that
Malaysians developed ACS at a younger age than that seen in neighbouring
countries.6 The mean age was 58.5 years and the peak incidence was in the 51-60
year age group.6 This is younger than that noted in Thailand (63.5 years)7 and
Singapore (median: 68.3-69.2 years).8
1.2
Prevalance of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Malaysia
There is more representative information on the prevalence of CV risk factors locally
from the National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS).
The Malaysian adult population (≥18 years) has high levels of CV risk factors.
•
63.6% of men, and 64.5% of women are either overweight or obese.9
•
43% of men smoke,9 59% of men between the ages 21-30 smoke.10
•
43.5% of men, and 52.2% of women have hypercholesterolemia.9
•
30.8% of men, and 29.7% of women have hypertension.9
•
16.7% of men, and 18.3% of women have diabetes mellitus.9
Data from NHMS V 2015 showed that the prevalence of these CV risk factors begin
to increase from the age of 30 years.9 (Table 7, pg 28)
The projected adult population (≥18 years of age) in this country for 2016, stands at
21.5 million, with 11 million men and 10.5 million women. The prevalence of CV risk
factors above translates into the following estimates:
•
13.8 million adults are either overweight or obese; 7.0 million men and 6.8
million women.
•
10.3 million adults have hypercholesterolemia; 4.8 million men and 5.5 million
women.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
•
6.5 million adults have hypertension; 3.4 million men and 3.1 million women.
•
4.8 million men smoke.
•
3.8 million adults have diabetes mellitus; 1.8 million men and 1.9 million women.
Clustering of these five CV risk factors is common, occurring in almost half of
Malaysian adults:
•
43.2% had at least 2 of the risk factors stated above.11
•
47% of those ≥30 years were at increased CV risk;12 based on the FRS;
 26.7% were at high CV risk.
 20.3% were at intermediate CV risk.
In the INTERHEART study, these 5 modifiable risk factors (abnormal lipids,
hypertension, current smoking, diabetes and abdominal obesity) contributed to
about 80% of myocardial infarcts (MI).13 Smoking and abnormal lipids accounted for
2/3 of the MIs in this study.13
1.3
Impact of Reducing/ Modifying CV Risk Factors
Diet and lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol
consumption, may contribute by as much as 70% towards the development of other
CV risk factors such as abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes and
hypercholesterolemia.14–17 Together they contribute to more than 95% of acute
coronary events.18
A decrease in these CV risk factors has been shown to reduce CV morbidity and
mortality in both people without (primary prevention) and with established CVD
(secondary prevention).19
Mortality risk reductions can be as large as 15-50% in the general population and by
20-45% in those with CVD.20 This magnitude is more than the mortality risk
reductions (range 18-26%) seen in the secondary prevention drug interventional
trials.20
Reductions in CV mortality can be achieved with reductions in CV risk factor levels
and improved treatment strategies. In Scotland, there was a 30% reduction in CV
mortality between 1975 –1994,21 and in England and Wales, reductions in CV risk
factors accounted for 79% of life years gained over 20 years.22 In Finland, mortality
due to CHD decreased by 82% in men and 84% in women between the years
1969-1972 and 2012.23,24
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Reductions in the 3 major CV risk factors – smoking, high cholesterol and high BP
accounted for almost all of the observed CHD mortality reduction during the first 10
years
of
the
study
and
about
69%
in
men
and
66%
in
women in the last 10 years.24
It was estimated that there would be over 5000 fewer deaths per year in the UK if the
total cholesterol was reduced by 1 mmol/L, the smoking prevalence was reduced
from 30% to 18% and there was a 3.2 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP.25
To tackle the CV epidemic in this country, dietary and lifestyle changes in the general
population have to be emphasized. This CPG aims to address this by
recommending the appropriate preventive measures, to be implemented in a
pragmatic way.
Key Message:
•
The prevalence of the common CV risk factors (hypertension, smoking,
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, overweight and obesity) in Malaysia is high and
shows a rising trend.
•
A decrease in these CV risk factors has been shown to reduce CV morbidity
and mortality in both people without (primary prevention) and with established
CVD (secondary prevention).
Recommendation:
•
To tackle the CV epidemic in this country, efforts should be made to reduce
global CV risk. Dietary and lifestyle changes in the general population should
be emphasized.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
2. Prevention of CVD
Prevention of CVD includes:
•
Primary Prevention Strategies -
This is directed at:
 The healthy general population. (Section 3)
 Individuals with multiple CV risk factors. (Section 4)
 Individuals who are at a high risk for a CV event. (Section 5 & 6)
•
Secondary Prevention Strategies -
This is directed at individuals who:
 Already have an index CV event* (Section 7)
*An index event is defined as ACS (ST elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction unstable angina, chronic
stable angina, and coronary revascularization by PCI or CABG), cerebrovascular accident (stroke), TIA and/or peripheral vascular
disease (PAD) manifesting as gangrene or intermittent claudication.
Population preventive measures (the Rose approach) and strategies specifically
seeking out and treating high-risk individuals (secondary prevention) are
complementary. However, the Rose approach (population based strategies) is more
cost effective.26
Individuals with a low risk CV profile in middle age have dramatically lower total, CV
and non-CV mortality rates, greater longevity, and substantially lower rates and
remaining lifetime risks for CVD events compared with individuals without the
profile.27–29 Similarly a healthy lifestyle in young adulthood has been shown to be
strongly associated with a low CVD risk profile in middle age.30
Recommendation:
•
In the prevention of CVD, population preventative strategies are more cost
effective and needs to be encouraged.

3. Estimation of Global Cardiovascular Risk
3.1
Primary Prevention
Based on the prevalence of CV risk factors in our local population, the
committee advocates screening in adults >30 years of age. (Table 7, pg 28)
The following information should be obtained for CV risk assessment:
•
History of smoking (and vaping)
•
BP
•
BMI and waist circumference
•
Lipid profile (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG)
•
Blood glucose/A1c
The committee advocates opportunistic rather than mass screening.
Healthcare professional should take the opportunity of any clinic encounter
with an individual to screen for CV risks (as listed above) and manage
accordingly.

Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
I, A
In primary prevention, the individual’s global CV risk should be determined to
help guide the intensity of risk factor reduction efforts. Individuals with
established CVD are already at High Risk. (Section 3.1)
There are many CV risk prediction models available. (Appendix 1, pg 165)
Ideally, the CV risk model used should be based on data derived from our
local population. A Malaysian CV risk score, however is currently not
available.
However, in the local population, the FRS-General CVD Risk Score for
primary care that predicts an individual’s 10-year future risk of developing
CVD (heart disease, strokes, PAD and heart failure) is commonly used. 31 It
has been validated for Malaysians of both gender in 2 independent
studies.32,33
For primary prevention, the committee recommends the use of the FRS
General CVD Risk Score for risk stratification. This risk score can be
calculated using lipid levels or BMI. Both FRS risk calculators based on lipid
levels and BMI were validated in the local population.32,33
The new 2013 ACC/AHA risk calculator has the advantage that it is gender
specific.34 In a local study, however, this risk model overestimated the
proportion of individuals requiring statins based on the pooled risk profile.35
The WHO/ISH CV risk prediction model is not recommended as it does not
work well for the Malaysian population.32
The FRS General CVD Risk Score can be calculated using Tables 1 & 2, (pg
18-19) or online at https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk-functions/
cardiovascular-disease/10-year-risk.php (Appendix 2, pg 166-167)
•
In calculating the risk scores (Table 1A & B, 2A & B, pg 18-19), the total
cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) should
be the average of at least 2 measurements.
•
The average baseline BP should be obtained from an average of several
readings.
•
A “smoker” means any cigarette smoking in the past month.
•
This risk score cannot be used to track changes in risk over time as risk
factors are modified.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
I, C
Based on the 10-year CV risk, individuals may be classified as:
•
>30% - Very High CV Risk
•
>20% - High CV Risk
•
10-20 % - Intermediate (or Moderate) CV risk
•
<10% - Low CV risk
Individuals who have a 10-year CVD risk of <10% are Low Risk. Low-risk
individuals should be given advice to help them maintain this status.
Many young individuals may fall into the category of Low Risk but they may
have a high lifetime risk if their individual risk factors are high due to
prolonged exposure. These include individuals with:
•
BP >180/110 mmHg
•
LDL-C >4.9 mmol/L
In these individuals, their lifetime CV risk can be assessed using vascular age
derived from the Framingham Risk Score.31 (Table 8, pg 32) This lifetime risk
model has not been validated in our local population.
Most individuals who are at Low and Intermediate (or Moderate) Risk can
be managed by lifestyle changes alone. Those at High Risk and High
Lifetime Risk may require pharmacotherapy in accordance with the
CPGs.36-38
Lifestyle changes involves:
•
A diet low in saturated fats, high in fiber and low in sodium (Section 8.1)
•
Regular exercise (Section 8.2)
•
Smoking cessation (Section 8.3)
•
Maintaining an ideal body weight (Section 8.4)
These individuals should be assessed and counseled appropriately at regular
intervals to ensure adherence to a healthy lifestyle and to determine if
treatment goals are achieved.
Smoking is an important CV risk factor in our local population and efforts
should be taken to encourage cessation.39,40 (Section 8.3)
I, A
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Recommendations:
•
For primary prevention, the committee advocates:
 Screening at >30 years of age
 Opportunistic rather than mass screening
 The use of the FRS General CVD Risk Score to assess the 10-year risk of
developing CVD and guide risk reduction efforts (Tables 1-3, pg 18-20)
•
The intensity of risk reduction efforts and treatment goals will depend on
the individuals’ baseline CV risk. (Table 3, pg 20)
•
Very High Risk individuals are those with:
 Have a FRS-CVD score that confer a 10-year risk for CVD of >30%
 Established CVD
 Diabetes with proteinuria or with a major risk factor such as smoking,
hypertension or dyslipidaemia
 CKD with GFR <30 Ml/ min−1/ 1.73 m2 (≥Stage 4 CKD)
•
High Risk Individuals include:
 Have a FRS-CVD score that confer a 10-year risk for CVD of >20%
 Diabetes without target organ damage
 CKD with GFR >30 - <60 Ml/ min−1/ 1.73 m2 (Stage 3 CKD)
 Very high levels of individual risk factors (LDL-C >4.9 mmol/L, BP
>180/110 mmHg)
•
In these Very High Risk and High Risk individuals, all risk factors should
be treated intensively to target via lifestyle modification and drug therapy
as indicated, in accordance with the respective CPGs. (Table 4, pg 21)
•
All other individuals should also be treated to target primarily by lifestyle
modification. If goals are not achieved, then drug therapy may be
necessary.
I, A
3.2
Secondary Prevention
Individuals with established CVD are at a high risk of a recurrent CV event.
All CV risk factors in these patients should be treated to target via lifestyle
modification and drug therapy as indicated, in accordance with the respective
CPGs.36-38

The incidence of CVD increases with age.46 This is due to the combined effects of
age related changes in the vascular system as well as the increased prevalence and
duration of exposure to adverse CV risk factors.47,48
5.1.2 Gender
The main cause of mortality in both gender in Malaysia is CVD.1
The onset of CHD may be delayed by about 10 years in women.18,49–51 The
prevalence is low before menopause but in mid-life, a woman’s risk for CVD
increases dramatically.51 One explanation is the increase in prevalence of CV risk
factors seen at this time. It is still unclear if this increase is due to oestrogen
deficiency or part of the “ageing” process.

5.1.3 Family history of premature CVD
Familial and genetic factors may play an important role in the determination of some
major risk factors, especially hypertension, lipid abnormalities and glucose
intolerance. In addition, there appears to be a familial predisposition to CVD.
The presence of CVD (CHD and stroke) in first degree relatives (parent or sibling)
before 55 years in men and 65 years in women is an independent risk factor for
future CVD.52–56 This risk is increased:
•
When the affected individual is a first-degree relative.
•
With the higher number of family members with CVD.
•
With the younger the age at which family members develop CVD.
•
If the affected individual is an identical twin.
•
If there is a maternal history of MI than a paternal history of MI.57,58
•
When there is a history of MI in second degree relatives.59
•
If there is a parental history of premature stroke.60,61
Despite earlier referral and treatment of individuals with a positive family history of
premature CVD, the excess risk still persists.62
5.1.4 Ethnicity
South Asians (Indians) have a higher prevalence of CHD and CV mortality compared
with Europeans.63 East Asians (Chinese and Japanese) exhibit consistently higher
rates of stroke.64,65
While conventional CV risk factors such as smoking, BP and total cholesterol predict
risk within these ethnic groups, they do not fully account for the differences in risk
between ethnic groups, suggesting that alternative explanations might exist.66
5.2
Modifiable CV Risk Factors
In 2010, CVD, diabetes and CKD accounted for 33 % of all deaths world-wide.67 The
4 modifiable CV risk factors – hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, raised blood
glucose and high BMI – together accounted for 63% of these deaths.67 Data from the
United States showed that in persons >35 years of age, smoking alone accounted
for 33 percent of all deaths from CVD and 20 percent of deaths from ischemic heart
disease.40 Even among individuals at high genetic risk, a favorable lifestyle was
associated with a 46% lower relative risk of CV events than an unfavorable
lifestyle.68

Disease 2017
5.2.1
Diet/Dietary Patterns
Diet plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic diseases such as
obesity, diabetes and CVD. At present, the emphasis is on dietary patterns instead
of focusing on single foods or nutrients.
A Mediterannean diet significantly reduces CV events.69-75 The DASH diet is
associated with a significant reduction in hypertension.76 A ‘high-fat/low-fibre’ a
‘high-sugar’ diet showed a trend for an increased risk of CV events in older men
aged 60-79 years.77
5.2.2
Smoking
Smoking is an independent risk factor for CVD and is estimated to increase the risk
of CVD (CHD and strokes) by 2-4 times.78 The risk is dose related. In addition,
smoking appears to have a multiplicative interaction with the other major CV risk
factors.40 For instance, if the presence of smoking alone doubles the level of risk, the
simultaneous presence of another major risk factor is estimated to quadruple the risk
(2 × 2).40 The presence of two other risk factors with smoking results in
approximately eight times the risk (2 × 2 × 2) of persons with no risk factors.40
In women, even with minimal use, CVD risk is elevated (RR: 2.4 for 1.4 cigarettes/
day).79,80 Young women who smoke and use combined oral contraceptive (COC)
have a very high CVD risk.81,82
Non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke increase their risk of developing CVD
and lung cancer.78,83 Scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of
exposure to second-hand smoke.83
5.2.3
Physical Inactivity
Regular exercise has a favorable effect on many of the other established CV risk
factors. Although the effect on any single risk factor is generally small, regular
physical exercise, in combination with a healthy life style, has a significant effect on
overall CV risk.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
In addition, PA reduces CV risk on its own, independent of its effect on other CV risk
factors.84 Individuals
exercising
for
an
equivalent
of
150
min/week
of
moderate-intensity exercise had a 14% lower CHD risk compared with those
reporting no exercise.84 This association was more pronounced in women.84 In a
study done in Australia, physical inactivity was found to be the most important
contributor
to
heart
disease
in
women
at
the
population
level.85
A sedentary lifestyle (combination of screen time - watching television and videos
and using a computer - and sitting time) has been shown to increase the risk of both
fatal and non-fatal CVD.86,87 Any form of physical exercise is better than none.84 Unfit,
lean men had a higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality than did men who
were fit and obese.88
5.2.4.
Obesity/Overweight
Obesity is often associated with other CV risk factors such as hypertension,
dyslipidemia and diabetes. However, obesity, by itself, is also an independent CV
risk factor.89–91 With increasing body mass, both CHD mortality and all-cause
mortality are increased.89,92-94 In women, even a modest weight gain (4 to 10 kg)
during adulthood, was associated with 27% increased risk of developing CHD
compared with women with a stable weight after adjusting for PA and other CV risk
factors.95
Weight loss is associated with a significant improvement in CV risk factors especially
diabetes and hypertension. An observational study showed a 25% reduction in
mortality rates in overweight diabetic individuals following an intentional weight loss
of 20-29 lb (9-13 kg).96 A randomized trial however, focusing on weight loss using
intensive lifestyle intervention, did not reduce the rate of CV events in overweight or
obese adults with type 2 diabetes.97
Bariatric surgery in obese individuals has been associated with improved
survival in the long term.98-100
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
5.2.5
Hypertension
Epidemiological studies have shown that CV risk rises in a strong, independent,
graded and continuous manner as BP levels increases, starting at ≥115/75 mm
Hg.101,102 The report on the Global Burden of Disease 2015 states that worldwide,
about 54% of stroke and CHD were attributable to hypertension.103,104 It is a major
cause of deaths (about 20%) and disability.103-105 In the Asia-Pacific region, up to 66%
of some subtypes of CVD can be attributed to hypertension.106 Reduction in BP has
consistently shown a reduction in CV events in both primary and secondary
prevention.107
5.2.6
Dyslipidemia
Genetic and epidemiological studies have consistently shown an association
between elevated TC, LDL- C levels and CVD. Randomized controlled trials have
also shown that lowering of the TC and LDL-C levels reduces CV events and CV
mortality.108-123
5.2.7 Prediabetes and Diabetes
Individuals with pre-diabetes, undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, and long-lasting type 2
diabetes are at high risk of CVD. More than 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes died
of CV causes.124 Women with diabetes are 44% more likely to develop CHD than
men125-129 Diabetic women are 50% more likely to have fatal CHD than men.128
Based on early studies, diabetes was considered a CHD risk equivalent, i.e. the CV
risk of an individual with diabetes is the same as that in an individual who had a prior
cardiac event.130 Contemporary data however, indicate that individuals with diabetes
have a significantly lower risk of CHD than those with a prior cardiac event across all
ages and in both gender.131,132
In individuals who have diabetes of long duration (>10 years) the CV risk is similar as
in those with a prior CV event.131-134 In these individuals, the risk of PAD and carotid
atherosclerosis is similar as those with pre-existing CHD.135
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
5.2.8 Cardio Metabolic Risk
Cardio metabolic risk refers to a cluster of CV risk factors that predispose to diabetes
and CVD. The common denominator is insulin resistance which is characterized by
abdominal obesity. The previous terminology was metabolic syndrome. This term,
however, is no longer in favour because only about 80% of individual with the
metabolic syndrome actually have biochemically confirmed insulin resistance.136
Further more, the syndrome does not necessarily predict a CVD risk that is beyond
the sum of the individual components.137 It also does not provide better predictive
power than the FRS.138
Key Messages:
•
CV risk factors may be:
Non-modifiable – increasing age, gender, family history of premature CVD,
ethnicity
Modifiable – hypertension, dyslipidemia, pre-diabetes/diabetes, smoking,
physical inactivity, obesity/overweight
•
The CV risk in individuals with long standing diabetes (>10 years) is similar to
those with a prior CVD.
Recommendation:
•
In addition to therapeutic lifestyle changes, individuals with modifiable CV risk
factors should be treated appropriately to target in accordance with the
respective CPG’s.

6. Other Conditions Associated with Increased CV Risk
6.1 Chronic Kidney Disease
Based on NHMS 2011, the prevalence of CKD in adults (≥18 years of age) was
9.07%.139 This was based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated
by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.
Risk factors for CVD and CKD overlap significantly. Traditional risk factors similar to
both include increasing age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking
and obesity.
In patients with CKD, non-traditional risk factors may also come into play and the
interaction of these factors is likely to explain why there is an increase in the risk of
CVD beyond traditional risk factors.140 These non-traditional risk factors include
“uremic”
type
factors
such
as
albuminuria,
hyperuricemia,
anemia,
hyperparathyroidism,
metabolic
bone
disease,
hyper-homocysteinemia,
inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.140,141
CV mortality increases linearly as the eGFR decreases below a threshold of <75
mL/min per 1.73 m2.140,142–144 CV mortality was about twice as high in patients with
stage 3 CKD (eGFR 30–59 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and three times higher in stage 4
CKD (eGFR 15–29 mL/min per 1.73 m2) than that in individuals with normal kidney
function.140,142-144
Albuminuria was also associated with all-cause mortality.140,142,143,145 It had no
threshold effect, even after adjustment for traditional CV risk factors and eGFR.140,145
According to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) 2016, the prevalence
of CVD among patients aged 66 and older who have CKD is 68.8%, compared to
34.1% among those who do not have CKD.146
Death from CVD is far more common in patients with CKD than progression to
end-stage renal disease (ESRD).146 CVD accounted for about 35% of deaths in
patients on dialysis in Malaysia.147 The two-year survival following an AMI in patients
without a diagnosis of CKD is 80%, compared to 69% for stage 1-2 CKD patients
and 53% for stage 4-5 CKD patients.146
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
MI in patients with CKD is due to premature atherosclerosis as well as
arteriosclerosis.148,149 In one study, up to 50% of non-diabetic dialysis patients
with symptoms of MI did not have large-vessel CAD.150 In these patients,
ischemia may be secondary to the combined effects of volume overload and
left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) which cause increased oxygen demand,
and small-vessel coronary disease which cause decreased oxygen supply.
In patients on dialysis, only 25% of CV mortality are due to MI, whereas the
other 75% are labelled as sudden or arrhythmic.151
Almost all risk scores do not incorporate CKD in their risk equations. The FRS
in particular, is less accurate in CKD patients.152 Some guidelines however,
have incorporated eGFR and micro-albuminuria into their risk stratification.153
Patients aged more than 50 years with CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min/ 1.73m2 or
albuminuria >30 mg/day or both) are regarded as high CV risk.153
6.2 Infections and the Heart
6.2.1 Influenza
A meta-analysis of case control studies done in non-tropical regions, have
shown an association between a recent influenza infection, influenza-like
illness or respiratory tract infection and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).154
In patients with CVD, influenza vaccination may reduce CV mortality and
combined CV events.155-158 However, additional higher-quality evidence is
necessary to confirm these findings.159
In patients without CVD, there is not enough evidence to establish whether
influenza vaccination has a role to play in primary prevention.159
The Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of
Cardiology (ACC) have however, been advocating influenza vaccination in
patients with CVD since 2010-2011.
To date, however, there is no supportive data of the benefits of influenza
vaccination in tropical regions. It is not recommended as routine.

6.2.2 Periodontal Disease
Epidemiological studies have shown that there is an association between
periodontal disease (PD) and CVD.160,161 These were largely association
studies focusing on surrogate markers of CVD and on clinical events (i.e.
CHD, MI, strokes and PAD). These associations do not imply causality.
Treatment of PD has been shown to result in improvement in surrogate
markers of inflammation and endothelial function but there have been no
interventional studies to show that it can prevent CVD.160-163
6.2.3 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
With the use of new and effective anti-viral therapy, the life expectancy of
patients infected with HIV is almost approaching that of the general
population.164 CVD is becoming an important cause of mortality
accounting for 6-11% of deaths.164,165
HIV infected individuals of both gender, are at increased risk of:
•
Premature CVD.166-171
 Atherosclerosis tends to be diffuse, circumferential and is often
accelerated172-175
 This increased CVD risk cannot be explained by the traditional risk
factors alone.176
 The causes are multifactorial and it has been postulated to be due to
systemic immune activation from various mechanisms resulting in
endothelial activation and atherosclerosis, metabolic derangements
due to anti-retroviral therapy and also the high prevalence of
traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity in these
patients.171,176–182
•
Arrhythmias including sudden cardiac death183,184
•
Heart failure185-188
•
Pulmonary hypertension189,190
•
Ischemic strokes191
Patients infected with the HIV should be screened and counselled about their
CV risk factors. They should be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle with
smoking cessation and regular exercise. The traditional risk factors
(hypertension,
diabetes,
dyslipidaemia,
obesity)
should
be
treated
appropriately.

6.3 Cancer and the Heart
Cancer may involve the heart by:192-194
•
Direct extension of the tumour to the pericardium and myocardium
•
Co-existing hypercoagulable state giving rise to acute thrombotic occlusion
•
Toxicity of therapy – both chemotherapy and radiotherapy
6.3.1 Chemotherapeutic Agents
These can give rise to:
•
Depression of LV function
•
Vascular toxicity
•
Hypertension
•
Arrhythmias
6.3.2 Radiation
•
Thoracic/mediastinal/neck radiation may result in an increased risk of:
 CAD (5-10% of patients)195
 Cardiac failure due to CAD, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy
 Acute (usually asymptomatic) and late pericarditis (5% of cases if the
radiation dose >40 Gy)195 including constrictive pericarditis,193
 Valvular disease (20% of patients) 195
 Conduction abnormalities (5% of cases)195
 Sudden death
 Ischemic strokes and TIAs196,197
•
CAD is more likely to occur if the patient was young at the time of the
irradiation
(≤21
years)
and/or
if
other
CV
risk
factors
are
present.194,195
•
Ostial stenosis is typical for radiation induced CAD.198
•
Radiation induced heart disease usually occurs after a long latent period
especially if the dose exceeded 30 Gy.194,199 It tends to be progressive.194,199
•
Women receiving left sided radiation for early breast cancer had a higher
prevalence of coronary artery abnormalities as compared to those who
had right sided radiation.200,201
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
6.4 Connective Tissue Diease
CVD is the leading cause of death in patients with connective tissue disease. The
chronic systemic inflammatory state may contribute to the susceptibility
for CVD particularly ischaemic heart disease (IHD).
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CV events accounted for 40-50% of
deaths.202-204 These patients have 1.5-2x the risk of myocardial ischemia compared to
the general population.205-207 Duration of disease, baseline c-reactive protein (CRP)
and rheumatoid factor positivity in addition to established CV risk factors have all
been shown to correlate with atherosclerosis and risk of subsequent CV
mortality.202,208-211 Lipid profile in these patients tend to show a low HDL-C and LDL-C
with an elevated very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglycerides -
lipid paradox.212 Lower lipid profile is associated with more severe inflammation.
More recent prospective studies tend to indicate a lower CV case fatality rate in
currently treated low disease activity RA.213
Congestive cardiac failure (CCF), more than IHD, appears to be an important
contributor to the excess overall mortality among RA patients.214 The risk of
developing CCF in RA is twice the risk of developing CCF in persons without RA, and
this excess is not explained by traditional CV risk factors and/or clinical IHD.215
Drugs used for the treatment of RA can exacerbate CCF such as non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, COX-2 inhibitors and glucocorticoids. The use of TNF-alpha
antagonist and methotrexate in these patient group have shown some degree of
protection for CV events.216
In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), there is a 7.5 to 17-fold excess
risk of CVD even after adjustment for the baseline Framingham risk estimates.217-220
Although there is a high frequency of traditional risk factors in these patients, it does
not fully explain the excess CV morbidity and mortality.220 In addition to inflammation,
steroid use has also been implicated.

Disease 2017
6.5 Sleep Disorders
The most common sleep disorders are insomnia and sleep apnoea. Based on
epidemiological data, both short sleep duration (<7 hours per night) and long sleep
duration (>9 hours per night) disorders as well as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
and insomnia are associated with poor cardiometabolic risk and outcomes.221
Insomnia is characterized by 3 primary symptoms:221
•
Difficulty falling asleep
•
Difficulty staying asleep and/or
•
Early morning awakenings that occur at least 3 nights a week for at least
3 months
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society recently
released a statement in favor of ≥7 hours of sleep per night for adults
“to promote optimal health”.222
Sleep apnoea is defined as at least 5 respiratory events (apnea or hypopnea) per
hour
of
sleep
(the
apnea-hypopnea
index
(AHI))
on
average
and
symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness.223
There are three types of sleep apnoea:
•
Obstructive
•
Central
•
Mixed
Of the three, OSA is the most prevalent sleep disordered breathing.221 In a local
cross-sectional screening survey, the prevalence of obstructive sleep symptoms –
habitual snoring, breathing pauses and excessive daytime sleepiness were 47.3%,
15.2% and 14.8% respectively.224
Epidemiological studies have consistently shown an association between sleep
disorders and CVD (arrhythmias, CHD, heart failure, hypertension and stroke) and
metabolic disorders (e.g. obesity, T2DM and dyslipidemia).221,225,226
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
High risk individuals who should be evaluated for OSA include:227
•
Obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2)
•
AF
•
CCF
•
Treatment refractory hypertension
•
T2DM
•
Nocturnal dysrhythmias
•
Stroke
•
Pulmonary hypertension
•
High risk driving population such as commercial truck drivers
•
Pre-operative bariatric surgery
It is advisable to screen these high-risk individuals, if they have daytime
sleepiness, for OSA.227 A commonly used assessment guide (STOP-BANG
questionnaire) is listed in Appendix 3, pg 168.
The diagnosis of OSA is confirmed with a formal full-night polysomnography
(sleep study). The number of individuals who are diagnosed and treated is
very small (tip of the iceberg) compared to >85% who remain
undiagnosed.225
Management of OSA includes:
•
Weight loss - This has been shown to be effective in improving and in
some cases resolving OSA.221
•
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP):
 Improves quality of life and daytime sleepiness.228
 Has a small effect on BP (2.6 mmHg difference in systolic BP and a
2 mmHg difference in diastolic BP).229 Combining weight loss and
CPAP may result in incremental reductions in BP as compared with
either intervention alone.230
 Does not result in weight loss.221
 Does not reduce CV events in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA
and established CVD.228
•
Others:
 Custom made oral appliances such as mandibular repositioning
appliances and tongue retaining devices.
 Surgery - There is insufficient evidence at present that surgery
improves OSA.231

6.6 Psychosocial Factors/ Depression
Clinical depression and depressive symptoms predict incident CHD232-234 and
worsen its prognosis.234-236 Both acute stress (e.g. natural catastrophic
disasters, acute outbursts of anger or grief, death of a spouse) as well as
chronic stress (e.g. at work or within the family) increase the risk of a CV
event.237 The INTERHEART study has shown that a cluster of psychosocial
risk factors (i.e. social deprivation, stress at work or in family life, financial
stress and depression) is associated with increased risk for MI.238
In a local study carried out among cardiac patients admitted to an urban
hospital, the presence of significant levels of depression and or life events
were ten times more likely to be associated with a recurrent cardiac event.239
There is strong association between psychosocial stress (especially
depression) and new onset and recurrent CVD.240 Psychological intervention
has been shown to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety but its
effects on CV events however, appear mixed.241-243
Coronary patients with clinically significant depression can be safely and
effectively treated with:
•
Psychotherapy244-248 or
•
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.249-251
A prudent approach at present is to offer patients with clinically significant
depression or anxiety treatment with psychotherapy and antidepressant/
anxiolytic medication. Those not accepting treatment should be followed
closely, and treatment offered again if symptoms persist for 4–6 weeks

6.7 Gender Specific Issues
6.7.1 Erectile Dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as persistent or recurrent inability to
achieve and maintain a penile erection of sufficient rigidity to permit
satisfactory sexual activity for at least 3 months duration.252 It is the
commonest sexual problem affecting men. The prevalence of moderate to
severe ED in a multi-ethnic Malaysian male population aged between 50-65
years old, was about 20%.253
The presence of ED is a reflection of the generalized vasculopathy present in
these men rather than indicating a cause and effect relationship with CVD.254
Many risk factors are common to both ED and CVD, the higher the number of
CV risk factors present, the higher the prevalence of ED.254 The presence of
ED increases the risk of future CV events in men with and without established
CVD.255 ED often precedes the occurrence of CVD by 2 to 5 years (average
3 years).256 It is also a marker of CHD severity and correlates with the extent
of the disease.257,258
It is important to make the public and healthcare providers aware that ED is
not merely a sexual health issue. It is indicative of a generalized vascular
problem.
Regardless of age, all individuals presenting with ED should be screened for
CV risk factors and the presence of occult CVD. Since ED often precedes
CVD, it gives a window of opportunity for intervention.
Lifestyle modification by exercise, improved nutrition, smoking cessation and
weight control, has been shown to reduce CV risk and also improve sexual
function.259-261
Risk factors such as BP, lipids and diabetes should be treated to target in
accordance with the respective CPGs.
However, the use of drug therapy to improve ED (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil)
does not result in a reduction in CV risk.

6.7.2 Pre-eclampsia/Pregnancy
Women with preeclampsia have an increased future risk of developing CHD,
stroke and venous thromboembolic events.262-265 It is not known if this
association is due to a common cause for pre-eclampsia and CVD, an effect
of pre-eclampsia on disease development, or both.
As there is a long latent period before these women develop CVD, it gives
them an opportunity and ample time to improve their CV health.
It is important that they be referred for CV risk factor monitoring and control in
the years after pregnancy.
6.7.3 Hormonal Female Contraceptives
Current or prior use of low-dose COC is associated with a small (2-3 fold)
increased risk of MI in healthy non-smokers who are younger than 35 years.
The risk of MI in this population is however very low and thus the CV risk is
also small.84,266,267 This risk is increased, however, if the women is diabetic,
obese, smokes, or has hypertension.
It is the estrogen component of COC that increases a woman’s CVD risk
especially at doses of 50 mcg or higher.266 The risk of thrombotic stroke,
venous thromboembolism (VTE), and MI increases as the dose of estrogen
increases.266 The risk for stroke and MI from the progestin component of COC
is relatively small.268,269 Progesterone-only pills do not increase the risk of CV
events.268,269 A recent review showed that third- and fourth-generation
progestin products containing desogestrel or drospirenone however, almost
doubles
a
woman’s
risk
for
VTE
compared
with
taking
levonorgestrel-containing pills.270-272
There are conflicting data regarding non-oral contraceptives (i.e. transdermal
system, vaginal ring) and CV risk. Both have VTE risks similar to those
associated with COCs.270,273
Before prescribing COCs, it is important to screen for CV risk factors and have
them optimally controlled. WHO has published a medical eligibility criteria for
COC use depending on the individual’s medical history.274

6.7.4 Menopausal Hormone Therapy– (Oestrogen Therapy/ Oestrogen
Progesterone Therapy – ET/EPT)
Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is widely used for controlling
menopausal symptoms.
The link between MHT and CVD can be summarised as follows:
•
Observational studies showed that postmenopausal women receiving
MHT had lower CHD event rates275
•
Primary prevention:
 Randomized controlled trials however showed that MHT increases CV
risk.276-278 These were conducted mainly in the elderly.
 In a sub-study, women receiving estrogen alone post-hysterectomy
did not have an increase CHD event rate but there was a small
increase in stroke.278
 Recent cohort studies showed that early initiation of MHT (defined as
within 5 years of the onset of menopause) were associated with a
decreased risk of future CHD and the surrogate marker (Carotid
Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT)), whereas late initiation (>5 years of
menopause) was associated with an increased risk for CHD.279-,280
•
Secondary prevention:
 There is no benefit of MHT in women with established CHD281-284
 There was no difference demonstrated between oral and transdermal
preparations on CIMT progression.285
In summary, MHT in whatever form should not be started solely for the
purpose of either primary or secondary prevention of CVD.
It is however effective for the treatment of menopausal symptoms (flushes,
vaginal dryness etc.). Its usage should be reviewed after 5 years.
We recommend that treatment decisions should be individualised taking into
account:286,287

6.7.5 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)
Male hypogonadism is defined as symptoms and signs of testosterone
deficiency in the presence of low testosterone levels measured by at least two
early-morning blood samples of free testosterone or total testosterone
obtained before 10:00 a.m.
The goal of TRT is to restore testosterone to physiologic ranges and reverse
symptoms of hypogonadism.
The issue of TRT is complicated by:
•
The abuse of testosterone as an anti-aging preparation (for cosmetic
reasons)288
•
The prescription of testosterone in men who have age-related non-specific
symptoms in the presence of low total testosterone levels
•
The prescription of testosterone in men who have ED (but not
hypogonadism) in the presence of low total testosterone levels
•
The concern about increased CVD risk among those taking testosterone.
289-291
6.7.5.1 Testosterone and CVD
Testosterone decreases with age and age itself is associated with an increase
in CV risk. It is not clear whether the association of CVD with low testosterone
is causal or simply a reflection of poor health.292,293
The issue of increased risk of CVD with the use of testosterone is still
unresolved.289-291
As such TRT should strictly only be used in patients with confirmed
hypogonadism.294,295 These patients should be monitored regularly with full
blood count (FBC) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels.296
It is not recommended for primary or secondary CV prevention.

Key Message:
Conditions that are associated with increased CV risk are:
•
Chronic kidney disease
•
Certain infections like HIV infection
•
Certain cancers and its treatment (chemotherapy and radiotherapy)
•
Connective tissue diseases
•
Obstructive sleep apnoea
•
Psychosocial stress/ depression
•
Gender specific issues:
 Erectile dysfunction: ED is an indicator for generalized vasculopathy.
Lifestyle modifications reduces the prevalence of CVD and also improves
sexual health
 Pre-eclampsia/ Pregnancy
 Combined oral contraceptives
 Sex hormone therapy – menopausal hormone therapy and testosterone
replacement therapy
Recommendation:
•
In these patients who are at increased CV risk, all CV risk factors should be
treated to target in accordance with the respective CPG’s.

7. Other Risk Markers of CVD
In addition to the conditions mentioned in Section 4, there are other markers
that indicate an increased risk for CVD and are sometimes used to help refine
CV risk assessment beyond the traditional risk factors found in the
Framingham Risk Score. These may be useful in risk stratifying individuals at
Intermediate (or moderate) CV risk.
7.1 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
After controlling for traditional risk factors, ECG abnormalities found at rest
and during exercise are associated with an increased risk of CV events.297
ECG is advisable in the initial assessment of adults with hypertension and/or
diabetes for CV risk assessment.298,299 The presence of resting ECG
abnormalities indicates the need for intensive risk factor reduction.
Exercise stress testing is not recommended in the routine CV assessment of
asymptomatic individuals.
It may have a role in the CV assessment of the asymptomatic individual with
an interpretable resting ECG who has a high pre-test likelihood of CAD and is
at intermediate to high CV risk. (Refer Appropriate Use Criteria for
Investigations and Revascularizations in Coronary Artery Disease)300
7.2 Echocardiography
Echocardiography in patients with:
•
Hypertension:
 Is more sensitive than ECG for the detection of LVH
 Should be considered in patient with ECG evidence of LVH. LVH in the
resting ECG is associated with increased all-cause mortality.301,302
•
Breathlessness - helps in the detection of LV function (systolic and
diastolic dysfunction).
The routine use of echocardiogram as a screening tool in the asymptomatic
population has not been proven beneficial. It may increase costs and potential
harm due to further downstream testing.

7.3 Biochemical – hs-CRP
An elevated hs-CRP level (>3 ng/mL) predicts a higher risk of CV event
independent of Framingham risk factors.121,303
It may be used in individuals at intermediate risk to reclassify them to high
risk.303
It is not useful for further risk stratification in asymptomatic high risk adults, or
low risk asymptomatic adults.
However, there is insufficient evidence that reducing hs-CRP levels will
prevent CV events.303
7.4 Subclinical Vascular Damage
7.4.1 Ankle-branchial Index (ABI)
The ABI is performed in a similar manner to a BP measurement. It is cheap
and reproducible. A value of <0.9 is indicative of arterial stenosis and the
presence of PAD.
Amongst patients with pre-existing CVD and/ or diabetes in an urban local
setting, the prevalence of PAD was estimated at 23%, of whom only a quarter
were asymptomatic.304
The presence of PAD indicates generalized atherosclerosis and a high CV risk
individual.
It is reasonable to measure ABI in adults in the intermediate risk group for
further stratification.305
7.4.2 Carotid Ultrasound
Carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for stroke.
Screening with carotid ultrasound in the general population with a low
prevalence of carotid stenosis (0.5-1%) may yield many false positives leading
to unnecessary interventions and harm.306
IIa,B
III,C
IIa,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
It is not recommended as a routine screening tool in primary prevention.
In the presence of carotid bruits, it is useful for quantification of stenosis.
7.4.3 Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT)
CIMT is a measure of early atherosclerosis in the carotid artery. Its extent is
associated with increasing CV risk, being more predictive in women than in
men.307 Many of the published studies were however performed in the
research setting.
A meta-analysis reported in 2012, found a lack of usefulness of CIMT as a
screening tool, taking into account the variation in its measurement and the
low reproducibility.308
It is therefore not recommended as a screening tool in the asymptomatic
population.308
7.4.4 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC)
CAC score is measured via a multi-slice CT and quantified using the Agatston
score. The presence of calcification within the coronary vessel indicates
atherosclerosis.309 The higher the value, the more extensive is the plaque
burden.310
It has a high negative predictive value. A score of 0 carries an almost 0%
cardiac mortality risk for the next 5 years.311
In addition to traditional CV risk factors, CAC:
•
Improves CV risk prediction in individuals at intermediate risk.312,313
•
Should not be used for CV risk assessment in individuals at low risk.314
7.4.5 Arterial Stiffness
Arterial stiffening is measured using pulse wave velocity (PWV) either from the
carotid to femoral or radial to femoral arteries. Elevated PWV is associated with
increasing stiffness and may predict future CV events.315 At present, its
utility is confined to the research environment.
It cannot be recommended as a screening tool for the asymptomatic
population.

Recommendation:
•
Risk markers that may be used to refine CV risk assessment beyond the
traditional risk factors found in the Framingham Risk Score include:
 Resting ECG
 Echocardiography- to look at LV function
 Biochemical – hs CRP
 Subclinical vascular damage
 Ankle brachial index
 Coronary Artery Calcium

They are most useful in further risk stratifying individuals at Intermediate (or
moderate) CV risk.

8. Interventions to Prevent CVD
8.1 Nutrition
Dietary habits influence a variety of cardio-metabolic risk factors such as body
weight, cholesterol, BP, glucose metabolism, oxidative stress and
inflammation.316,317 It is being increasingly recognized that instead of focussing
on specific nutrients, it is more important to look at specific foods and overall
dietary patterns.316,317
General recommendations should fit in with the local culture. Energy intake
should be adjusted to avoid overweight/obesity.
8.1.1 Nutritional Composition of Food
The recommended nutrition intake (RNI) by the National Coordinating
Committee on Food and Nutrition Malaysia (NCCFN) 2017,318 states that the
total daily calorie intake should consist of:
•
CHO: 50-60%
•
Total fat: 20-25% with an upper safe limit of 30%
•
Protein: 10-20%
This concept is however difficult for most people to interpret and implement.
Thus, the focus at present, has shifted from concentrating on individual
nutrients to food groups and dietary patterns
8.1.1.1 Fats
It is generally recommended that total fats contribute to about 20-25% with an
upper safe limit of 30% of the total calorie intake.153,318-320
For the prevention of CVD, the types of fatty acids consumed are more
important than the total fat content.153,320
I,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Fatty acids are divided into:
1. SFA – The current recommendation is that the intake of SFA to be <10%
of total calorie intake.153,319,320 Sources of SFA are primarily from
animal products, but also includes tropical plant oils.
2. Unsaturated fatty acid- Depending on the number of double bonds, these
can be further classified as:
•
PUFA – These contain 2 or more double bonds. PUFA is divided into
two subgroups:
 Omega-3 Fatty Acid - This consists of:
o Alpha-linolenic acid - found in vegetable oils such as corn,
soybean, safflower and sunflower oil.
o Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) - found in marine oils
o Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - found in marine oils
Sources of DHA & EPA are higher-fat, cold-water fish such as salmon,
mackerel (kembong), herring, oily kembong (pelaling), patin, keli,
terubuk.321
 Omega-6 Fatty Acid - This consists of linoleic acid, an essential
fatty acid that can be found in vegetable oils such as soybean, corn,
and safflower.
•
Monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) - MUFAs are primarily from plants
and include olive oil, canola oil and peanut oil.
A central issue in the relationship between SFA and CVD is the specific
macronutrients that are used to replace it in the diet.153,320
When PUFA, MUFA or CHO are used to replace SFA in the diet, TC, LDL-C,
apoprotein B and to a lesser extent HDL-C levels are all significantly
reduced.322 Replacing SFA with PUFA leads to the most favourable lipoprotein
profiles.322
Excess CHO intake also causes other metabolic derangements such as
insulin resistance, obesity and diabetes. The quality of the CHO (low versus
high glycaemic index, refined starches and sugar rich beverages versus
grains and fruits) was not however addressed in the studies.317
I,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
When PUFA is used to replace SFA, there is consistent data that CV events
and coronary mortality are reduced.320 It is estimated that replacing 1% of
energy from SFA with PUFA lowers CHD incidence ≥2-3%.317,323 The evidence
is not that clear that replacing SFA with MUFA or CHO lowers CVD risk.317,320
The total matrix of a food is more important than just its fatty acid content when
predicting the effect of a food on CVD risk, e.g., the effect of SFA from cheese
on blood lipids and CVD may be counter-balanced by the content of protein,
calcium, or other components in cheese.316 In addition, the special fatty acid
profile of the SFA (short-chain vs medium-chain vs long chain) may modify the
effect on CHD risk.317
Taking PUFA or MUFA (e.g. 1 teaspoon of olive oil) without cutting down SFA
intake will not confer CV benefit. (Appendix 4, pg 169 for fat and calorie
content of common Malaysian food)
Trans Fatty Acid (TFA)
This is a type of fat formed by the process of hydrogenation to increase its
shelf life.324
Trans fat appears to increase the risk of CVD more than any other
macronutrient on a per calorie basis.324 A meta-analysis has shown that on
average a 2% increase in energy intake from TFA increases CHD risk by
23%.324,325 Total TFA intake was associated with all-cause mortality, CHD
mortality and total CHD.326,327 Industrial, but not ruminant, TFA were associated
with CHD mortality and CHD.327
The current recommendation is for TFA to contribute <1% of total energy
intake and the lower the better.153,319,320 TFA may be found in partially
hydrogenated margarines, snack foods, bakery products and deep fried fast
foods.324
The most recent analysis from the CDC USA showed a remarkable
improvement in the lipoprotein profile of the American population. It was
suggested that this was due to the reduction of TFA in the diet.328 This followed
the FDA removing TFA from the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS)
Status.
I,A
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
8.1.1.2 Dietary Cholesterol/Eggs
The impact of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol level is weak when compared
with the impact of the fatty acid composition of the diet (section 8.1.1.1). Lowering of
SFA intake usually also leads to a reduction in dietary cholesterol.153,320
Some nutrition guidelines do not give specific recommendation on the intake of
dietary cholesterol.153,320 Although the evidence linking dietary cholesterol and CVD is
weak, dietary cholesterol often co-exists with SFA (e.g. in meat, fried food). To avoid
confusion and as practical advice, most international guidelines advise limiting the
intake of dietary cholesterol to less than 300 mg/day.329
In contrast to SFA and TFA, dietary cholesterol in general and cholesterol in eggs in
particular, have limited effects on the blood cholesterol level and on CVD.153,320,330,331
Egg consumption of 4-7 eggs per week was shown not to be associated with an
increased CVD risk in diabetic or non-diabetic individuals at high CV risk.332,333
8.1.1.3 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates in the diet may take the form of:
•
Starches - These include:
 Starchy vegetables like sweet potatote, tapioca, yam, pumpkin, breadfruit,
corn and potatotes
 Dried beans, lentils and peas such as as mung beans (green grams),
chickpea, red gram, yellow dhal, lotus seed and baked beans
 Grains like rice, oats, barley -these may be whole grain (entire grain kernel
e.g. brown rice, whole meal flour) or refined grains (e.g. white rice, white
flour)
•
Fibers - This is the indigestible part of plant foods, including fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes.
•
Sugars - These include:
 Naturally occurring sugars such as those in milk or fruit
 Added sugars
When recommending diets to reduce the risk of CVD and diabetes, the nature of
CHO is of considerable importance.334 Whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes
are the most appropriate sources as compared to sugars.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
CHO may also be categorized by their:
•
Glycemic index (GI) which is a measure of how quickly food glucose is absorbed
•
Glycemic load (GL) which is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in food
CHO with a low GI value (55 or less) are usually rich in fibre and are preferred
because they are more slowly digested, absorbed and metabolized. This results is an
improvement in post prandial hyperglycemia.
It is important to consider both GL and GI:
GL = GI x CHO (g)/ 100
In the Nurses' Health Study, women who consumed diets with a high GL (refined
CHO) were at increased risk of CHD at 10 years compared with those with a lower
consumption.334,335 This effect appeared to be independent of total energy intake and
other CV risk factors.
A high dietary GL from refined CHO increases the risk of CHD, independent of known
coronary disease risk factors.335
Please refer to Appendix 5 & 6, pg 170-171 for CHO content of common Malaysian
food and their GI.
8.1.1.4 Protein
This includes both animal and vegetable sources such as meat, poultry, seafood,
beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts and seeds.
Substituting animal for vegetable protein has not been shown to be associated with
an increased risk for CHD.336,337 Protein intake from red and processed meat, dairy
products, fishes, nuts, eggs, and legumes were all found not to be significantly
associated with CHD risk.336
Partially replacing dietary CHO with protein either from animal or vegetable sources,
led to significant BP reductions.338
High protein diets increase short-term weight loss and improve blood lipids, but high
quality long-term data are lacking. The available data seem to suggest that in the
long term, a low CHO high protein diet is associated with increased CV risk.339,340
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
8.1.2 Individual Food Groups
8.1.2.1 Whole Grains and Dietary Fibre
Whole grain can be found in whole wheat, whole rice, barley, corn rye, oats,
millet, sorghum, canary seed and brown/red/wild rice (‘padi huma’).
Whole grain food are rich sources of many nutrients such as complex CHO,
dietary fibre, minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and phyto-oestrogens such as
lignans most of which are lost from the grain during processing.341 They are
not merely sources of dietary fibre.341 Studies have shown that the intake of
whole grain was associated with a reduction in CV, total cancer and all-cause
mortality.342,343
Dietary fibre can be divided into:
•
Insoluble fibre, which includes cellulose and lignin. This is found in
vegetables, some fruits and whole grains
•
Soluble fibre which is present in fruits, pectin, guar gum, legumes and in
oat bran.344,345
Prospective cohort studies have shown that a higher intake of total fibre is
associated with lower risk of:344-348
•
CHD
•
Stroke
•
Diabetes
An adequate intake is 14 g total fibre per 1,000 kcal, or 25 g for adult women
and 38 g for adult men.349
Our local recommendation, in accordance with NCCFN 2005350 and Scientific
Advisory Committee On Nutrition (SACN) 2015,351 is 20 to 30 g per day of
dietary fibre. The dietary fibre content of common food is as in Appendix 7, pg
172.
8.1.2.2 Sugar
There is consistent evidence indicating an association between a high intake
of sugar and the risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and CVD.320 Strong
evidence supports the association of added sugars with increased CV risk in
children through increased energy intake, increased adiposity and
dyslipidaemia.352
I,B
I,A
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
It is recommended that children consume ≤25 g (100 Cal or ≈6 teaspoons) of
added sugars per day and to avoid added sugars for children <2 years of
age.352
For adults, <10% of total energy intake should be from added sugar. This is
equivalent to 50 g (or around 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body
weight consuming approximately 2000 calories per day.319,353 An intake of
sugar contributing to <5% of total energy intake has additional health
benefits.319
Sugars may be naturally occurring as occurs in fruits, or, it may be added as
occurs in soft drinks packet drinks, cordials, local drinks such as ‘air sirap
bandung’, ‘teh tarik’. Individuals who consumed >25% of their daily calories
as added sugars were twice as likely to die of CHD as those who consumed
<10%.354
Replacing sugar-containing sweeteners with low-calorie sweeteners reduces
calorie intake, body weight, and adiposity.320 However, the long-term effects of
low-calorie sweeteners are still unknown and thus this practice is not
recommended.320
Research, to date, is inconclusive whether using non-nutritive artificial
sweeteners to replace caloric sweeteners, i.e. added sugars, in food and
beverages, can reduce carbohydrate and calorie intake, body weight,
appetite or lower cardiometabolic risk factors associated with diabetes and
CVD.355 Substituting non-nutritive sweeteners for added sugars may help in
weight loss/weight control – as long as if there is no compensatory increase
in energy intake from other sources.355 Non-nutritive sweeteners include food
additives such as aspartame, acesulfame-K, neotame, saccharin, sucralose,
and plant-derived stevia.355
Fructose is considered the most hypertriglyceridemic sugar and is thought to
account for the hypertriglyceridemic effect of sucrose.356 High-fructose corn
syrups are similar in composition and metabolic effects as sucrose.357
High intake of fructose present in fruit juices and products containing
high-fructose corn syrups (present in most biscuits, cakes, 3 in 1 beverages,
carbonated drinks, jams, peanut butter) is associated with unfavorable effects
on obesity, blood lipids, fatty liver and insulin resistance.
The drinking of water instead of sweetened beverages should be
encouraged.

8.1.2.3 Vegetables and Fruits
Eating more fruit and vegetables has been shown to decrease the risk of CVD
and lower BP.358-363 The mechanism of action is not known, but it is assumed
that the health effect of vegetables and fruits can be attributed to the dietary
fibre and antioxidants in these food item. It also acts as a low calorie,
low-sodium and satiating food.
WHO recommends 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day (3 servings of
vegetables and 2 servings of fruit)318 Daily intake of fresh fruit and vegetables
(including berries, green leafy and cruciferous vegetables and legumes), in
an adequate quantity (400-500 g per day), is recommended to reduce the risk
of CHD, stroke and high BP.364
(Appendix 8, pg 173 – for serving size and weight of selected fruits and
vegetables)
8.1.2.4 Nuts
Despite being high in fat, higher intake of nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) has
been associated with reduced risk of CVD, total cancer and all-cause
mortality.365
Daily consumption of 30 g of nuts reduces the risk of CVD by almost
30%365,366
8.1.2.5 Dairy Products
The studies looking at the effects of full-fat dairy milk on CVD outcomes have
shown conflicting results.367-369 In general, of the limited number of studies that
examined the association between the intake of total high-fat or low-fat dairy
products and the risk of CHD or stroke, most studies showed no association,
pointing to the need for long-term intervention studies.367-369 A recent
meta-analysis has shown that dairy consumption may be associated with
reduced risks of CVD especially stroke risk.370,371
The complex matrix of dairy foods, rather than individual milk components,
may be as important to improving CV health.

Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
8.1.2.6 Fish
Eating fish at least 2-4 servings a week resulted in a 21% reduction in the risk
of dying from CHD and a 6% reduction in the risk of stroke.372,373 For this
reason, most guidelines advice eating fish at least 2-4 servings a week. The
protective effect of fish on CVD is attributed to the omega 3 fatty acid content.
Observations from some prospective cohort studies, however, have found no
association between consumption of fish and CVD.374-376
Earlier studies showed that the supplemental use of n-3 fatty acids reduces
CV morbidity and mortality.377-379 More recent trials conducted in patients with
established CVD or multiple CV risk factors have been negative.380-382
Fish oil supplements are not effective in reducing CV risk.380-383
Fresh fish is preferred and the method of preparation is also important (deep
frying should be discouraged).372,373
8.1.2.7 Salt - Sodium and Potassium
A low sodium diet has been shown to reduce both systolic and diastolic BP in
normotensive and hypertensive patients.384,385 There was a direct relationship
between increased sodium consumption and subsequent risk of CVD, heart
failure and stroke.386
Based on the results of the DASH trial, most guidelines have recommended
a daily salt intake of <2,300 mg.387
Following more critical analysis of the data, the United States Department of
Agriculture Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee concluded that the evidence is inconsistent and insufficient to
conclude that lowering sodium intakes below 2,300 mg/day either increases
or decreases risk of CVD outcomes (including stroke and CVD mortality) or
all-cause mortality in the general population.320
Currently, a reduction in sodium intake by approximately 1,000 mg/day is
advocated.320 This would result in a reduction in CV events by about 30
percent.320,388
IIa,B
IIb,B
IIa,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
A higher dietary sodium intake is associated with a greater risk for fatal and
non-fatal stroke and CVD.320
In a more recent analysis, it was found that a high sodium intake was
associated with an increased risk of CV events and death in hypertensive
populations but not in normotensives.389 A low sodium intake however, was
found to be associated with an increased risk of CV events and death in both
normotensives and hypertensives.389
This data suggests that lowering sodium intake is best targeted at
populations with hypertension who consume high sodium diets.389
There is a relationship between the effects of sodium and potassium on BP.
Two meta-analysis found that increasing the intake of potassium and
reducing the intake of sodium in patients with high BP led to a reduction in
BP.390,391 In the general population however, there is inadequate data at
present, to indicate that increasing potassium intake would result in a
decrease in BP or CV morbidity and mortality.320
WHO recommends <2000 mg of sodium (which is equivalent to 5 g of salt =
1 leveled teaspoon) per day for children and adults.388 (Appendix 9, pg 174
for salt content of common Malaysian food)
However, a low sodium diet is not recommended in populations with a low salt
intake.389
8.1.2.8 Alcoholic Beverages
There is J shaped curve between alcohol intake and a variety of adverse
health outcomes.392 Low levels of alcohol intake have been found to reduce
all-cause mortality in both men and women.393,394
In non-pregnant women, this should not exceed 1 drink (10 g/day) per day
and in men 2 drinks a day. (Appendix 10, pg 175)

8.1.3 Dietary Patterns
Dietary patterns, is a term used to describe combinations of different foods or food
groups that characterize relationships between nutrition and health promotion and
disease prevention.395
8.1.3.1 Mediterranean Diet
A Mediterranean Diet has been associated with a lower risk of CVD.70,71,396,397 It has
been associated with:
•
An approximately 30% relative risk reduction in rate of major CV events in high
risk individuals.70,71
•
A lower risk of diabetes.70,398
•
A lower BP especially the diastolic BP.399
When compared to low carbohydrate diet (LCD) or low fat diets, a Mediterranean diet
has been associated with:
•
A greater amount of weight loss in overweight/ obese individuals.400
•
The prevention in the development of the metabolic syndrome.401,402
•
Improvement in CV risk factors and inflammatory markers.403
There are many different “Mediterranean diets” among different countries but in
general, the key components of the diet, in addition to regular physical activity are:
•
High intakes of extra virgin olive oil (as the principal source of fat), vegetables
(including leafy green vegetables), fresh fruits (consumed as desserts or
snacks), cereals (mostly wholegrains), nuts and legumes.
•
Moderate intakes of fish (especially marine blue species), seafood, poultry,
dairy products (principally cheese and yogurt) and red wine (with the exception
of Muslim populations).
•
Low intakes of eggs, red meat, processed meat and sweets.
Total fat in this diet is 25% to 35% of calories, with saturated fat at ≤8% of calories.404
There is a high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio.405
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
8.1.3.2 DASH Diet
The DASH Diet (Dietary Advice to Stop Hypertension) consists of vegetables and
fruits, low fat dairy products, whole grains, chicken, fish and nuts. It is low in fat, meat,
sweet and sodas. It provides more calcium, potassium, magnesium and dietary fibre
and less fat, SFA, cholesterol and sodium than the typical western diet.406
DASH diet has been shown to reduce systolic and diastolic BP in normotensive and
hypertensive individuals.368 The BP lowering effects is enhanced if there is in addition,
restriction of sodium and lifestyle changes such as reducing weight and
increasing physical activity.369,407
8.1.3.3 Low Carbohydrate Diets
LCD or “ketogenic” diets restrict CHO intake to 20 to 60 g per day (typically less than
20 percent of the daily caloric intake).407 The remaining calories come from either fat
or protein.
A LCD has been shown to have favourable short term changes on body weight and
major CV risk factors i.e. low HDL-C and raised TG.400,408,409 It is difficult to sustain and
as a result weight gain often recurs.400
The effects of this dietary pattern on long-term health are unknown.410,411
For these reasons, it is not encouraged.
8.1.3.4 Low Fat Diet
In a low-fat diet (LFD) <30% of daily energy intake is from total fat and <7% from
SFA.412
Clinical trials have shown that LFD:
•
Results in less weight loss and lower CV risk reduction as compared to LCD,
Mediterranean or high fat diets 400,413,414
•
Did not reduce the risk of CVD even when coupled with an increased intake of
vegetables, fruits, and grain415

8.1.3.5 Malaysian Healthy Eating Recommendations -
#QuarterQuarterHalf Diet
The Malaysian Healthy Plate Guideline promotes the #QuarterQuarterHalf
plate which is a visual tool that shows the proportion of food groups that is
recommended to be eaten during a meal in order to achieve a balanced and
healthy diet.
It is a general recommendation for assisting in food portions and unlike the
Mediterranean and DASH diets, its effect on CVD has not been studied.
The Healthy Plate Guideline aims to encourage Malaysians to increase the
intake of fruits and vegetables, consume wholegrain cereals in reasonable
portions along with an adequate intake of protein and to drink plain water.
Recommendation:
The Malaysian Healthy Eating Recommendations is the #QuarterQuarterHalf
plate which consists of:
•
Quarter of the plate being CHO – rice, noodles, bread, cereals and other
cereal products and/or tubers
•
Quarter of the plate being protein – fish, poultry, meat and/or legumes
•
Half of the plate being fruits and vegetables
•
Drinking plain water
The five key recommendations that accompanies the Malaysian Healthy Plate
guideline are:
1. Consume 3 regular healthy main meals everyday
2. Consume 1-2 servings of healthy snacks when necessary
3. Consume at least half of your grains from whole grains
4. Consume non – fried & santan free dishes everyday
5. Consume home cooked foods more often.

Physical activity
Any amount of physical activity (PA) is better than none; adults engaging in any
amount of PA gain some form of health benefits.86 It is beneficial in both
primary and secondary prevention.
•
Primary prevention:
 Regular PA effectively reduces the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality
in healthy individuals by 20–30%86,416–419
 Physically active men and women generally have a 25% to 30% lower
risk of CVD than the less active419-423
•
Secondary prevention:
 Regular PA confers significant mortality and morbidity reductions
following an acute cardiac event424-427
PA is any bodily movement that substantially increases energy expenditure.
This includes: (Table 9, pg 72)
•
Leisure-time physical activities
•
Occupational activities
•
Commuting activities
•
Exercise: a subset of PA that is planned and structured, involving repetitive
bodily movement done with a goal to improve or maintain physical fitness
The recommended duration of PA in healthy adults regardless of age
is:416,417 (Tables 9-11, pg 72-74)
•
At least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity or
•
75 minutes a week of vigorous intensity PA or an equivalent combination
In addition, individuals are encouraged to engage in resistance and flexibility
exercises whenever possible or necessary. (Table 10, pg 73) A practical
simplified approach to exercise is as in Table 11, pg 74.
At each clinic visit, the importance of regular PA should be emphasized. The
MOH Malaysia advocates walking 10,000 steps a day. This is a practical and
easily achievable goal for most individuals.428
Wherever possible, individuals should be referred to physiotherapists/ exercise
physiologists for exercise prescribtion for primary prevention of CVD.

Following an acute cardiac event or post cardiac surgery, patients should be
enrolled into a cardiac rehabilitation program. This is a medically supervised
program consisting of exercise training, education on heart healthy living
and counselling to reduce stress and help patients return to an active
lifestyle and recover more quickly. It:
•
Helps the identification and management of comorbid conditions and
psychosocial disorder (anxiety and depression)429,430
•
Ensures patient adherence to medical and lifestyle therapies to achieve
CVD prevention goals431
For a more detailed discussion on cardiac rehabilitation, refer to the

Key Messages:
•
Regular physical activity reduces all cause and CV mortality.
Recommendations:
•
All individuals should be encouraged to exercise.
•
Any amount of physical activity is better than none

Smoking Intervention
Cigarette smoking is a major cause of CVD99,432-434
•
Tobacco smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke together are
responsible for about 6.3 million annual deaths worldwide.432
•
Smoking accounted for 33% of all deaths from CVD and 20% of deaths
from IHD in persons ≥35 years old.39
Smoking is an independent risk factor for CVD40
•
It also interacts with other CV risk factors, such as glucose intolerance and
low serum levels of HDL-C in a multiplicative manner.40,435,436 Examples:
 The presence of smoking alone is reported to double the level of risk,
but the simultaneous presence of another major risk factor is
estimated to quadruple the risk (2 × 2).40
 The presence of two other risk factors with smoking may result in
approximately eight times the risk (2 × 2 × 2) of persons with no risk
factors.40
Smoking is an important cause of plaque rupture leading to ACS.80 Data from
the NCVD-ACS Registry showed that 18.8% in 2007-2009, and 23% in
2010-2012 of patients were smokers.6 In the INTERHEART study, a dose
response relationship was demonstrated between the number of cigarettes
and MI, where smokers who smoked >40 cig/day were found to have a 9-fold
relative risk of MI compared with non-smokers.437
Changing cigarette designs such as filtered, low-tar, and “light” variations,
have not reduced overall disease risk among smokers.40
Stopping smoking after an MI is the most effective prevention measure.39,40
There is significant reduction on morbidity within the first 6 months of quitting
and the risks of CVD almost equals the risk of never smokers after 10-15 years
of cessation.40,434
8.3.1
Smoking Cessation Interventions
A person with nicotine dependence develops both physiological and
psychological dependence, i.e. tolerance, physical dependence, and a
withdrawal syndrome when stopping smoking.438
I,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Cigarette smoking is a learned behavior that becomes part of the daily routine
of a smoker and is often used to cope with stress, anxiety, anger, and
depression.439 Thus, an effective smoking cessation strategy should include
physiological and psychological intervention, and pharmacotherapy.
Many studies have shown that a combination of these methods is a more
effective smoking cessation strategy.440-443
A meta-analysis showed that abrupt cessation and smoking reduction
produced comparable quit rates in smokers.444
8.3.1.1 Psychosocial counselling
Psychosocial counselling interventions range from brief counselling by the
physician to intensive, cognitive-behavioral counselling interventions over
several weeks.
The efficacy of behavioral counselling interventions for smoking cessation has
a dose-response relationship; that is, the efficacy increases with increased
intensity and duration of the program.442,443
The most successful counselling interventions for cardiac inpatients include
high-intensity baseline counselling with sustained contacts after discharge for
prevention of relapse. However, even with the most successful counselling
interventions, at least 40% of smokers who have cardiac disease, resume
smoking within one year.445 Guidelines for smoking cessation recommend the
addition of pharmacotherapy to counselling as pharmacotherapy has the
potential to improve smoking cessation rates in smokers with CVD.440-443
The committee recommends that these patients be referred to the MQuit
Services. Currently this smoking cessation service is being implemented at all
health clinics throughout the country, selected pharmacies and online.

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)
 There are 5 types of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray,
vapour inhaler, and lozenge)
 The choice of the NRT will depend on:420
o Clinician familiarity with the product
o Patient preferences
o Contraindications – e.g. history of depression, concerns about weight gain
 The patch features a slow (2–3 hours) onset with steady levels over a 16- or
24-hour period which provides long-term relief of withdrawal symptoms.446
 The disadvantage is the inability of users to self-titrate their nicotine levels in
the way they had while they were smoking.446
 The remaining four NRT products feature a more rapid onset, but shorter
duration of action, requiring repeated administration to maintain patient
comfort and relief from withdrawal symptoms.446
 A combination of short- and long-acting NRT products are more
effective than using a single NRT product.446
 NRT is safe in patients with CVD.447-449
•
Varenicline
 Clinical trials report varenicline to be superior to bupropion in promoting
smoking cessation, and prolonged administration has been shown to reduce
relapse in smokers who had been abstinent 12 weeks after initial therapy446
 A meta-analysis conducted by FDA found that the risk of a major CV end
point with varenicline was low but advised that physicians weigh the risks of
varenicline against the benefits of its use.450
•
Bupropion (sustained-release)
 This drug, an anti-depressant, is also a recommended therapy for smoking
cessation. However, in Malaysia, its use for this purpose is off label
 The major risk of bupropion is that it lowers a person’s seizure threshold.
There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion
use.445
There is no evidence to support the use of alternative therapies such as acupuncture
or hypnosis for smoking cessation.443

Electronic Cigarettes
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices that simulate
combustible cigarettes by heating nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour
that is inhaled.
The prevalence of e-cigarette users in Malaysia in 2015, was found to be
3.2% and 10% of the regular users were reported to be <18 years old.452 The
prevalence of shisha smoking among students was reported to be about
30%.453
The long-term safety of e-cigarette and shisha smoking is however
unknown.
The latest report of the US Surgeon General states that:454
E-cigarette aerosol is harmful.453
•
The use of products containing nicotine poses dangers to youth,
pregnant women, and fetuses.
•
Nicotine exposure during adolescence can cause addiction and can
harm the developing adolescent brain.
The use of e-cigarettes and shisha are not recommended.
Key messages:
•
Smoking is an independent and strong cause of CVD.
•
There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.
Recommendations:
•
Smoking should be strongly discouraged and individuals should be
referred to the MQuit smoking clinics.

Obesity and Body Weight
The NHMS 2015 showed that about 30.0% and 17.7% of adults over the age
of 18 years were overweight and obese respectively by the WHO criteria.9
(Table 12, pg 79) This is a significant increase compared to 1996, when only
16.6% and 4.4% were overweight and obese.456 The Malaysian NCVD-ACS
Registry 2011-2013 showed that 76.5% of subjects who underwent PCI for
ACS were either overweight or obese.6
Obesity increases the risk of:115,457-459
•
All-cause mortality about 20%.
•
Overall CV mortality by 50%.
•
CHD mortality by about 50% in women and about 60% in men.
Every 5 kg/m² higher BMI, was associated on the average with a 30% higher
overall mortality and 40% increase for vascular mortality.115 In morbid obesity
(BMI ≥40 kg/m²) CV mortality is increased by 200% to 300%.460
Modest weight loss of between 5 to 10%, can reduce BP, improve glycaemic
control, lipid profile, and quality of life.461

8.4.1
Management of Overweight and Obesity
Weight loss is a challenge and preventing weight regain after weight loss
may be even more difficult.
The goals of therapy are to achieve 5 to 10% weight loss461,466-470 and to
maintain this over a period of 1-2 years before attempting further weight loss.
The following individuals should be considered for referral to a specialist
obesity clinic for futher weight management:
•
Obese individuals with BMI >35 kg/m².
•
Those with existing co-morbidities and BMI >32 kg/m².
8.4.1.1 Non-pharmacological Interventions
Weight-loss strategies include:
•
Dietary interventions:
 Negative deficit of 500 calories is a practical initial target and easily
implemented. This results in weight loss of 0.5 kg/week.
 For a greater weight loss, calories restriction of 1200 to 1500
kcal/day is recommended.467 This can be achieved by using meal
replacement or calorie counting.
 Calories restriction 400-800 kcal/day has to be clinically supervised.
 Nutritional counselling is highly recommended to maintain long term
adherence. (Appendix 11, pg 176 for tips on losing weight)
•
Physical Activity is important to maintain the weight loss (Appendix 11,
pg 176, Tables 9&11, pg 72 & 74).
 PA is recommended to be started slowly for unfit persons and to
increase gradually each week, such as starting at 60 minutes per
week and slowly increase to 150 min per week.
 For weight loss, increased PA of approximately 250 to 450 minutes
of moderate-intensity PA per week, including strength training 2 to 3
times per week is required.471

•
Behavioural modifications
 Multiple behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring of eating habits
and PA is necessary to maintain the lifestyle intervention.472
 In primary care, however, behavioural weight loss interventions yield
very small reductions in body weight.473
8.4.1.2 Pharmacological Interventions
Drug therapy should be considered for overweight and obese people
with:474
•
BMI >25.0 kg/m2 plus 2 CV risk factors or
•
BMI ≥ 27.0 kg/m2 after failing to lose weight despite 6 months of lifestyle
modification.
Two anti-obesity drugs that are available locally are:475-479
•
Sympathomimetic (Phentermine) – this drug should not be used
continuously for longer than 6 months at any one time.
•
Lipase Inhibitor - Orlistat
•
Glucagon-like peptide 1 Receptor Agonist - Liraglutide479
Anti-obesity drugs may enhance weight loss by an additional 3-5%. In
addition, the use of Orlistat in obese individuals had shown a reduction in
diabetes incidence by 37.3% with a mean weight reduction of 5.8 vs 3.0 kg
compared to placebo.476
8.4.1.3 Bariatric Surgery
Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective method for attaining significant
and sustainable weight loss. It is recommended when lifestyle and
pharmacological interventions have failed in the severely obese patients.
There may be a role for bariatric/metabolic surgery in reversing metabolic
abnormalities such as glucose intolerance, hypertension and dyslipidemia in
the obese.
The Asian Consensus Meeting on Metabolic Surgery (ACMOMS)
recommends that bariatric surgery be considered as a treatment option for
obesity in Asians if BMI:480
•
>35 kg/m2 with or without co-morbidities.
•
>32 kg/m2 with co-morbidities.
•
>30 kg/m2 if central obesity + 2 CV risk factors.
I,B
IIa,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
I,A
It is essential that a comprehensive evaluation be performed by a multidisciplinary
team consisting of medical, surgical, psychiatric, rehabilitation physician and
nutritional expertise prior to surgery. This is important to minimize the complications of
surgery and to maintain weight loss post-surgery.
Following bariatric surgery, mean excess weight loss is 61.2%, ranging from 47% for
gastric banding to 70% for gastric bypass.481 Sleeve gastrectomy appeared to be
more
effective
in
weight
loss
than
adjustable
gastric
banding
and comparable with gastric bypass.482
In addition to the weight loss, there is improvement in CV risk factors.479,481-489 CV
events and mortality.492–496
Risks of complication, reoperation and death post bariatric surgery is small but do
exist.482 Long term follow up is needed in a person who has undergone bariatric
surgery
since
nutritional
complications
can
occur
especially
following
the malabsorptive procedure.497
Key messages:
•
Overweight and obese individuals should be counselled that lifestyle
changes can produce a 5-10% rate of weight loss that can be sustained
over time and that this can be associated with clinically meaningful health
benefits.
•
Bariatric surgery may be considered as a treatment option for obesity if
BMI:
 >35 kg/m2 with or without co morbidities.
 >32 kg/m2 with co-morbidities.
 >30 kg/m2 if central obesity + 2 CV risk factors
•
Bariatric surgery has been shown to improve CV risk factors, CV events
and mortality.
Recommendation:
•
For weight loss, in addition to dietary intervention, adults should engage in
150–420 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.

9. Management of Individual Risk Factors
In the primary prevention of CVD, the emphasis should be on the assessment and
management of the global risk of the individual and not solely concentrating on
individual risk factors. The global CV risk can be calculated using many different CV
risk calculators. The risk calculator that has been validated in our local population is
the Framingham General CV Risk Calculator for primary care.31 (Tables 1-3, pg
18-20), Appendix 2, pg 166-167.
9.1
Hypertension
The NHMS 2015 showed that the prevalence of hypertension among adults 18 years
old and above is 30.3%.9 It is now estimated that there are 6.4 million individuals with
hypertension in Malaysia. According to NHMS 2011, almost two thirds (61%) of
individuals with hypertension in Malaysia were unaware they were having
hypertension.498 Of all patients with hypertension and on treatment, only 35% of them
achieved target BP.498 With the anticipated doubling of CVD burden especially in the
developing world in the next few decades, it is imperative that major risk factors like
hypertension be optimally managed.
9.1.1
Preventing Hypertension
9.1.1.1 The Population Approach
The objective is to prevent hypertension by lowering the average BP by a relatively
small amount across a whole population. In a study done in UK, it was estimated that
a reduction in SBP as low as 2 mmHg could prevent >14,000 deaths per year.499 By
encouraging enough people to change their lifestyles sufficiently to lower their BP,
large numbers are shifted to below the threshold for hypertension (140/90 mmHg).499
The main lifestyle changes required to achieve this are:
•
Reducing the population average intake of salt to 5 g per day (65-75% of salt
intake is from processed foods)500 (Appendix 9, pg 174 for salt content of
common Malaysian food)
•
Increasing potassium intake by increasing fruit and vegetable intake to at least
five portions a day
•
Controlling weight to achieve a 5-10% weight loss in overweight or obese people
•
Increasing habitual PA to a total of at least 30 minutes a day of at least
moderate-intensity activity, on five or more days of the week for adults, and at
least 60 minutes each day for children
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
•
Avoiding alcohol or controlling alcohol intake within recommended benchmark
limits for either sex
9.1.1.2 The ‘At-risk’ Individual or Group Approach
This approach focuses on people known to be at higher risk of developing
hypertension than the general population. This includes:
•
Those with a family history of hypertension.
•
Obese individuals.
•
Older people (>65 years).
•
Presence of other CV risk factors.
9.1.2
Managing Hypertension for the Prevention of CVD
Reducing BP to target values will result in a reduction in CV events in both primary
and secondary prevention.37,107,499,501
The objectives of treatment are:37
•
Preventing the complications of hypertension by reducing BP to target levels and
•
Reducing the global CV risk of the individual by detecting and correcting other CV
risk factors simultananeously.
As far as possible, this should be achieved without causing the individual adverse
effects from medications or other interventions.
Once hypertension is diagnosed, the patient should be risk stratified (Table 14, pg 86)
and staged accordingly. (Table 13, pg 86) The algorithm for management of
hypertension is in Fig 1, pg 87.
All patients should be counselled on non-pharmacological measures as outlined in
Section 9.1.1.
Drug treatment should be instituted at the outset in the following scenario:37
•
Stage 2 hypertension or beyond (SBP ≥160 and or DBP ≥100 mmHg )
•

Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
9.1.2.1 Stage 1 Hypertension
In patients with stage 1 hypertension, treatment should be started with a single drug
at low dose. If after a sufficient period of treatment (up to six weeks) with
monotherapy, BP is still not controlled, there are three options:
•
The dose of the initial drug can be increased
•
The drug can be substituted with another class of drug
•
A second drug can be added
Increasing the dose of the initial anti-hypertensive agent or adding a second agent is
preferred if the patient shows response to the initial drug but target BP is not
achieved. Increasing the dose of the initial drug to the maximal dose, may however
give rise to dose-related adverse effects.
Properly selected anti-hypertensive combinations may also mitigate the adverse
effects of each other. To improve compliance, a single pill combination drug may be
considered. If the patient does not show response or does not tolerate the initial drug,
drug substitution is recommended.
9.1.2.2 Stage 2 Hypertension and Higher
In patients presenting with stage 2 hypertension or beyond, combination therapy is
recommended. Efforts should be made to reach target BP. (Table 4, pg 21)
In general, once the BP is controlled, most patients will require life-long treatment.
9.1.2.3 Resistant Hypertension
This is defined as BP still >140/90 mmHg with three drugs, inclusive of a diuretic, at
near maximal doses. The possible causes of resistant hypertension include:
•
Medication non-adherence
•
Secondary hypertension
•
White coat hypertension
•
Excessive sodium intake, excessive liquorice intake and drug interactions.
•
Complications of long standing hypertension such as nephrosclerosis, loss of
aortic distensibility and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
9.1.2.3.1 Management of Resistant Hypertension
In these patients:
•
Secondary causes of hypertension should be excluded
•
A 4th anti-hypertensive agent should be added. This would include either/or:
 β-beta blockers.
 Spironolactone.
 α-blockers.
 Combined α and β-blocker.
 Vasodilators.
•
Referral to a specialist is often necessary.

Dyslipidaemia
Elevated cholesterols (especially LDL-C) is an important CV risk factor.
Studies done in western countries and in New Zealand have shown that the
biggest benefits with regards reduction in CHD mortality using the Scottish
CHD mortality model, have come from reductions in smoking.24 However, in
the UK, reductions in cholesterol seem to have even greater potential to
further reduce CHD mortality rates.25
Importantly, it was estimated that population CHD mortality is reduced more
by a 1% relative reduction in cholesterol than by a 1% relative reduction in
population mean BP or smoking prevalence.25
9.2.1
Management
Numerous studies have conclusively shown that LDL-C reduction leads to a
reduction in CV mortality and CVD.108-123 A 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C
reduces vascular mortality by 22%.502 Statins have consistently been shown
to be beneficial in both primary and secondary prevention.108-123
Observational studies indicate that a low HDL-C and raised TG are
associated with adverse CV outcomes.503-505 However interventional trials that
increase HDL-C and/or reduce TG levels have not shown any CV
benefit.506-510
9.2.2
Targets of therapy
LDL-C is the primary target of therapy.108-123,502
The target LDL-C level will depend on the individual’s global risk. (Table 3, pg
20)
Both the absolute on treatment LDL-C level and the percentage LDL-C
reduction achieved have been found to correlate with the observed CV
benefits.113,510-515 (Table 15, pg 90)
I,A

Disease 2017
Non-HDL-C may be considered as a secondary target when treating patients
with:
•
Combined hyperlipidaemias
•
Diabetes
•
Cardiometabolic Risk
•
CKD
In measuring lipid levels:
•
A standard lipid profile includes measurement of plasma or serum TC,
LDL-C, HDL-C and TG.
•
LDL-C is usually calculated by the Freidewald equation which is not valid in the
presence of elevated TG (TG >4.5 mmol/L).
•
Both fasting and non-fasting samples may be used for lipid measurement.516
All individuals should be risk stratified using Table 3, pg 21. The target lipid levels will
depend on their CV risk (Table 15, pg 90). In individuals who are Very High Risk and
High Risk, drug therapy should be initiated at the same time as therapeutic lifestyle
changes. (Table 16, pg 90). Statins are the drugs of choice because they have been
the most well studied and have been consistently shown to be safe and effective.
In patients at Low and Intermediate (Moderate) Risk, the emphasis should be on
therapeutic
lifestyle
changes.
(Section
8).
If

goals

9.3
Prediabetes and Diabetes Mellitus (type 2 and type 1)
9.3.1
Prediabetes
9.3.1.1 Definition
Prediabetes is a condition when blood glucose levels are higher than normal but
below diabetic thresholds.
It includes any of the following categories: (Table 17, pg 93)
•
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) – FBG: 6.1-6.9 mmol/L
•
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) – 2-hour post load glucose level following oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 75 gm oral glucose between 7.8 – 11.1
mmol/L
•
Prediabetes – A1c: >5.6 to <6.3%
9.3.1.2 Epidemiology
In general, the proportion of individuals with prediabetes tends to be equal or greater
than that of diabetes in any studied population.517
Based on the Metabolic Syndrome Study of Malaysia (MSSM) 2008 the prevalence
of prediabetes (based on the OGTT) among adults above the age of 18 years was
20% while that of diabetes was 22%.518
9.3.1.3 Prediabetes as a Risk Factor for CVD
Existing evidence indicates that:
•
There is a linear relationship between blood glucose levels and CVD.519
•
The risk of CVD is almost 2 fold in subjects with prediabetes compared to those
with normal OGTT.520
•
All-cause and CVD mortality is significantly increased in individuals with IGT
but not with IFG.520
•
At A1c values below the diabetic range (5.7 - 6.3%) there is an increased risk
for CHD, stroke and death.521
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
9.3.1.4 Diagnosis
Screening can be done by measuring capillary blood glucose levels using
glucometers. If the test is positive (random capillary blood glucose ≥7.8 or fasting ≥
5.6 mmol/L), a confirmatory test can be performed by one of the following methods:
•
OGTT with 75 grams of glucose
•
FBG
•
A1c
If A1c is used for the diagnosis of prediabetes, it is best that the test is followed by an
OGTT to classify individuals into either IFG, IGT or combination of both. This has
prognostic significance in terms of the risk of developing CVD and conversion to full
blown diabetes.520

•
First-degree relative with diabetes
•
Hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)
•
HDL-C <0.9 mmol/L or TG >2.8 mmol/L

 Cushing’s syndrome,
 Acromegaly,
 Phaeochromoytoma,
 Presence of acanthosis nigricans etc
•

medications:
 Antiretroviral therapy (Level II-1)
 Atypical antipsychotic drugs (Level II-2)
 Corticosteroids
 Thiazide diuretics
 β-blockers
 Statins
In those without the above risk factors, testing should begin at the age of 30 years.
If tests are normal, screening should be done annually (Section 9.3.1.4).

9.3.1.6 Management
With proper management of prediabetes, progression to diabetes can be
delayed. However, this has not been shown to reduce CVD.522-524
Interventions that can prevent the development of diabetes include:
•
Lifestyle Measures38:
 Are the mainstay of therapy.
 Have greater efficacy than pharmacological intervention and are
practical and cost effective.
 Have shown long-term effects on prevention of diabetes beyond the
period of active intervention.
 Consists of a modest 500 kcal reduction in total caloric intake per day
resulting in a desired weight loss of 0.5 kg per week.
 Includes moderate intensity physical activity of 150 mins a week.
 Aims for a modest target weight loss of 5-7% of body weight over a
6-month period.
 May include food with low GI and high in fibre to help reduce
post-prandial hyperglycemia. (Appendix 5-7, pg 170-172)
 CHO counting and meal replacement strategies are proven to help
patients control their blood glucose levels as well as their weight.
•
Pharmacotherapy:
In addition to lifestyle intervention:
 Biguanides (Metformin) can be considered for those at very high
risk of developing diabetes. These include:522,525,526
o Combined IFG & IGT,
o IGT + obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2),
o IGT + <60 years old,
o Previous history of GDM or for
o Those who failed lifestyle therapy after 6 months
 The Biguanide (Metformin) is the only drug that has been endorsed
widely527,528
 Other pharmacological interventions include:
o Alpha-Glucosidase inhibitors (Acarbose) – this showed a 95%
reduction in CVD in one study529
o Lipase Inhibitors - Orlistat476
o Thiazolidinediones - Rosiglitazone/Pioglitazone530,531
o Glucagon-like peptide 1 Receptor Agonist - Liraglutide479
Other CV risk factors should also be managed appropriately in accordance
with guidelines.

9.3.2
Diabetes
The diagnosis of diabetes is conventionally based on FBG, 2-hour post
load/challenge with 75 gm oral glucose or A1c values that correspond to the onset of
microvascular complications, namely retinopathy. However, it is known that the risk
of CVD starts to increase at a much lower level of blood glucose compared to the
onset of diabetic retinopathy (Section 9.3.1.3).521
9.3.2.1 Epidemiology
According to the NHMS 2015, the prevalence of diabetes in adults above the age
of 18 years was 17.5%.9 In addition:9,541,533
•
The prevalence in the 20-24 year age group was 5.9%. (Table 7, pg 28)
•
The prevalence was highest in the Indians (22.1%) followed by Malays (14.6%)
and Chinese (12.0%).
•
More than half (53%) of those with diabetes were unaware of their diagnosis.
•
The percentage of undiagnosed diabetes was highest among the Malays (64%)
followed by the Chinese (52%) and the Indians (42%).
•
Of concern is the proportion of undiagnosed diabetes among those below the
age of 30 years (88%).
•
Only 23.8% of patients in primary care and 12.7% in tertiary institutions were
able to achieve their A1c targets.
9.3.2.2 Diabetes & CVD
The metabolic milieu of diabetes comprises mainly of but not limited to insulin
resistance, reduced insulin secretion and/or their combination. These are
responsible for endothelial dysfunction, increased platelet reactivity and
inflammation; factors that trigger and aggravate atherosclerotic vascular disease and
thrombosis.534
The higher mortality and complication rates seen in diabetic patients appear to be
multifactorial. Diabetes is associated with:535
•
Severe coronary artery disease.
•
Systolic left ventricular dysfunction.
•
Autonomic neuropathy.
•
Larger infarct size.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
These result in a higher risk of death when diabetics have an acute coronary event. It
also increases their risk of recurrent CV events and other long-term complications
such as heart failure and sudden death.536
9.3.2.3 Definition, Classification and Diagnosis
Diagnosis of diabetes can be made by measurement of: (Table 17, pg 93)
•
FBG
•
2-hour blood glucose level post 75-grams of oral glucose
•
A1c level
For symptomatic individuals, 1 abnormal result is sufficient to make the diagnosis. In
asymptomatic individuals, the abnormal test result should be repeated on a different
day to confirm the diagnosis.
9.3.2.4 Specific Measures for Primary Prevention of CVD in Diabetes
Patients who have diabetes >10 years duration or above the age of 40 years:
•
Should be on statin therapy regardless of their lipid level80,81,537
•
Aspirin is not routinely recommended538,539
•
The other CV risk factors should be treated to target (Table 7, pg 28)
9.3.2.4.1 Severe Hypoglycaemia as a Predictor of Subsequent CV Events
Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication of insulin secretagogues
such as sulphonylureas and meglitinides and insulin therapy. It may affect daily
activities and is a hindrance to tight glycaemic control. Hypoglycaemia is classified as
severe when it requires a third-party assistance to correct it.
Individuals with severe hypoglycaemia are at a very high risk of developing CVD.
Severe hypoglycemia:
•
Has been shown to be associated with subsequent increased risk of a CV event;
9-20% in the next one year and as high as 49-80% over the next 4-7 years.540-542
•
Could either contribute to the adverse outcomes or it may just be a marker of
vulnerability to such events.541
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Patients with more than a 10-year history of diabetes who have been hospitalised for
hypoglycaemia should have the following performed:
•
Anti-diabetic medications should be adjusted to reduce the risk of
hypoglycaemia.
•
Glycemic target if necessary should be less stringent.
•
Their overall CV risk profile should be reassessed and other risk factors should
be intensified. (Optimization of BP, lipid, smoking cessation etc)
•
Screen for CVD and refer to a cardiologist when indicated.
9.3.2.4.2 Treatment Targets in Individuals without CVD (Table 19, pg 98)
The treatment targets in this group of patients should be individualised. In general,
most patients should aim for an A1c target of < 6.5 %. Patients with proteinuria are at
risk of developing chronic kidney disease and ESRD which can be prevented by strict
glycaemic control.543
In view of the strong association between hypoglycaemia and CVD, the following
patients should have an intermediate A1c target of between 6.5-7.5%:544-546
•
High CV risk score based on FRS
•
High risk of hypoglycaemia or
•

9.3.2.4.3 Treatment Targets in Individuals with Pre-Existing CVD (Table 20, pg
99)
The treatment targets in this group should be set initialy at a modest level (HbA1c:
6.6-7.4%). If the patient can achieve this target without any risk of hypoglycaemia
within 3-6 months, then a lower target should be aimed for. If however, the patient
develops new or recurrent hypoglycaemia, the target should be revised.

***Caution should be exercised when intensifying treatment in diabetic patients with CVD whose baseline A1c is high (>8%) and
who have never experienced an episode of hypoglycaemia.575 A higher initial A1c target of ≥ 7.5% is preferred with gradual
introduction of therapy aimed at controlling blood glucose levels. If this is achieved without significant increase in hypoglycaemia a l
ower A1c target of 6.5%-7.0% may be considered.

9.3.2.5 Management
9.3.2.5.1 Lifestyle Measures
This is as outlined in Section 9.3.1.6.
9.3.2.5.2 Pharmacotherapy
General guidelines on the use of anti-diabetic agents:
•
The aim of treatment is to bring to target the A1c, fasting and post-prandial blood
glucose levels (in that order) while avoiding the risk of hypoglycaemia and
unwarranted weight gain.
•
Metformin is the preferred choice as a first line therapy. However other oral
anti-diabetic agents are acceptable alternatives depending on the individual
patient profile. It should only be stopped completely if the GFR <30 mL/min per
1.73 m2. It is important to reiterate that metformin does not cause or aggravate
kidney disease.
•
Oral agents that improve fasting hyperglycaemia more than post-prandial
hyperglycaemia include metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZD).
•
Sulphonylureas, meglitinides, acarbose, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors
(DPP-4i) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) tend to reduce
post-prandial hyperglycaemia more than fasting hyperglycaemia.
•
Compliance and the manner of taking anti-diabetic agents should be ascertained
before intensifying or adding other classes of anti-diabetic agents.
•
Therapy should be intensified if glycaemic targets are not obtained after 3
months. Combination of up to 4 classes of oral agents are permitted as long as
the patient’s A1c is <10% or they are not severely symptomatic, prior to the
initiation of insulin therapy.
•
Triple combination therapy consisting of metformin, TZD and Glucagon-like
peptide–1 (GLP-1) agonists at diagnosis has been shown to slow the
progression of diabetes. However the use of TZD is contraindicated in those who
are prone to cardiac failure, osteoporosis and has a history of bladder cancer
(applicable for pioglitazone).
•
It is important to emphasise to patients that intensive therapy that achieved
targets at the beginning of diagnosis helps to improve risk of CVD in the long
term.548 (Legacy Effect/ Metabolic Memory)

9.3.2.5.3
Glycemic Control for the Prevention of CVD
9.3.2.5.3.1 Primary Prevention
The trials of glycemic control in the prevention of CVD in diabetics have shown mixed
results in the past.541,547,549
In type 1 DM, intensive glycemic control has been shown to reduce the risk of a CV
event in the post-trial long term follow-up analysis.550
In T2DM however, intensive glycemic control has not as yet been shown to reduce CV
event rates in any randomized controlled trial. However, in the long term post-trial
follow up study there appears to be a reduction in CV mortality and CV event in those
randomized to intensive therapy. This benefit that manifested long after the period of
intervention is termed the legacy effect or metabolic memory.548
In the management of patients with diabetes an approach that targets multiple CV risk
factors (blood glucose, BP, cholesterol, smoking cessation and weight) has clearly
been shown to reduce CVD (The Steno Trial).551
The importance of a multifactorial approach in preventing CVD cannot be
over-emphasized as more than two-third of individuals with diabetes die from CVD.552
9.3.2.5.3.2 Secondary Prevention
In the DIGAMI trial, patients who received intensive insulin therapy following an MI
had a reduction in CV mortality at 1 year which was sustained in the 20-year post-trial
analysis.553,554 The initial result was however not reproduced in the subsequent
multi-centre DIGAMI 2 trial.555 Nevertheless DIGAMI II still supports the CVD benefit
of a good glycemic control following an AMI.555
There are concerns of the CV safety of some anti-diabetic drugs.556,557
•
Caution should be exercised when prescribing thiazolidinediones as they are
associated with an increase incidence of heart failure and should be avoided in
those in NYHA Functional class 3 & 4.
•
A re-analysis of the PROACTIVE trial involving the TZD, pioglitazone, showed a
significant reduction in the composite CVD end-points and a reduction in the risk
of subsequent CVD in patients with a history of CVA.558,559
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
•
Saxagliptin, a DPP-4i, was also shown to be associated with hospitalisation for
heart failure although no increase in CVD mortality occurred in these
individuals.560 However this is not seen in the other agents of the same class,
establishing the CV safety of DPP-4i.561
Recently, the SGLT2i (empaglifozin) and the GLP-1 agonists (liraglutide and
semaglutide) have been shown to be associated with a reduction in the risk of CV
composite end-points.562-564 This benefit is only seen with CV mortality and not with
the other 2 main CV end-points of non-fatal MI & strokes.
Despite the approval of FDA for empaglifozin in preventing CV mortality, several
pertinent issues such as the increased trend in strokes, heterogeneity in sub-groups
analysis, inappropriate CV end-points adjudication, increased drop-out rate at the end
of the trial remained unanswered.562 In the case of liraglutide and semaglutide,
concerns regarding pancreatic cancers and proliferative retinopathy (HR: 1.76 with
semaglutide)
respectively
during
the
trials
have
yet
to
be

The recommendations in Fig 2, pg 103 are based on the following order of priority:
1. Safety profile
2. Cardio Metabolic Risk Reduction
3. Glycaemic Efficacy
4. Patient’s convenience
5. Cost
However, in some situations, cost may preclude the available choices. Based on
conservative price listing of Empaglifozin and Ligralitude, the estimated cost spent
is:
•
RM 922,560 over 3.1 years for treating 62 patients with empaglifozin to avoid
one CVD composite end point.562
•
RM 1,305,702 for 3.8 years for treating 53 patients with ligralitude to avoid 1
CVD composite end point.563
Key Messages:
•
The risk of CVD starts to increase at much lower levels of blood glucose than
that required to make a diagnosis of diabetes.
•
The aim of treatment is to bring to target the A1c, fasting and post-prandial blood
glucose levels (in that order) while avoiding the risk of hypoglycaemia and
unwarranted weight gain.
Recommendations:
•
A1c targets for patients with diabetes and low risk of CVD should be ≤6.5%
•
A1c targets for patients with diabetes and CVD should be individualised. The
target should be:
 A1c ≤6.5% - for patients without any risk of hypoglycaemia
 A1c 6.5 – 7.5 % - for patients initiated on agents with risk of hypoglycemia
 A1c ≥7.5% - for patients assessed to be at risk of hypoglycaemia
•
A1c targets for patients with diabetes and high risk of CVD should follow those
with diabetes and established CVD.
•
Patients who have diabetes of >10 years duration or above the age of 40 years
should be on statin therapy regardless of their lipid levels
•
Patients aged 40 years and above with long standing diabetes (>10 years) who
experienced an episode of severe hypoglycaemia that required hospitalisation
are recommended to undergo screening for CVD and be referred to a
cardiologist if indicated. Treatment of all other CV risk factors should also be
intensified.

9.4.1 Antiplatelet Agents
9.4.1.1 Primary Prevention of CVD – Table 21, pg 108
9.4.1.1.1 Non-diabetics
Aspirin:
•
This is the only agent investigated for the primary prevention of CVD
•
The beneficial effect of aspirin in both gender is a modest reduction in
non-fatal MI at a dose of ≤100mg per day.565,566
•
There was no effect on non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality or CV
mortality.565,566
•
Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative MI benefit.565
•
The benefits of aspirin need to be weighed against the risk of bleeding
especially gastrointestinal bleed.565-567
For the primary prevention of CVD, aspirin:
•
Is not routinely recommended for the primary prevention of CVD.565
•
May be considered in individuals with multiple CV risk factors who are
not at an increased risk of bleeding.565
Combination therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel):
•
The only study that investigated this combination versus aspirin alone in
individuals at high risk of CVD (defined as either pre-existing CVD or risk
factors) showed a small benefit of CV event reduction which was almost
similar to the rate of bleeding.568
•
This combination is not recommended for primary prevention of CVD.569
9.4.1.1.2 Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
In patients with diabetes, aspirin is not routinely recommended.538,539,570
It may be considered in patients with diabetes >10 years duration if the

In patients with established CHD (>1 year), long term treatment with:
•
Aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily is recommended571,572
•
Clopidogrel 75 mg daily may be an alternative in patients with aspirin
intolerance569
In patients <1 year after an ACS who have not undergo PCI, the
recommendation is dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1 year with:573
•
Low-dose aspirin 75-100 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg daily.570,573,574
•
Low-dose aspirin 75-100 mg + ticagrelor 90 mg BD.573,575,576
In patients <1 year after an ACS who have undergone PCI (with either bare
metal or drug eluting stent), the recommendation is DAPT for 1 year with:
•
Low-dose aspirin 75-100 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg daily.570,573,574
•
Low-dose aspirin 75-100 mg + ticagrelor 90 mg BD.573,575,576
•
Low-dose aspirin 75-100 mg + prasugrel 10 mg daily.573,577 Prasugrel is
not recommended in patients with a body weight of <60 kg, age >75
years, or with a previous stroke/TIA.573,577
After the first year, to continue with either aspirin or clopidogrel (if aspirin is
not tolerated).573,578
In some individuals who have undergone complex PCI, a longer period of
DAPT has been found to be beneficial.579
In patients who undergo CABG, following ACS and/or prior PCI with stent
implantation DAPT can be considered for at least a year.

9.4.1.2.2 Cerebrovascular Disease
In patients with a recent non-cardio-embolic ischemic stroke or TIA,
antiplatelet agents that have been investigated for secondary prevention
include:580
•
Aspirin

Is recommended for secondary prevention

Recommended dose 75 – 325 mg daily

For patients who use low-dose aspirin (≤325 mg) for prolonged
intervals, the annual risk of serious gastrointestinal hemorrhage is
about 0.4%, which is 2.5 times the risk for non-users.

Aspirin therapy is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic
stroke that is smaller than the risk for ischemic stroke, resulting in a
net benefit.
•
Clopidogrel

Is a reasonable option in individuals who are allergic or cannot
tolerate aspirin

Its efficacy was found to be similar to that of aspirin in a subgroup
analysis of a large study.581
•
Combination therapy

Aspirin + clopidogrel – when initiated days to years after a stroke or
TIA has no additional benefit compared to aspirin alone.568 This
combination is associated with an increased risk of bleeding.568 It is
not recommended in routine practice.

9.4.2.1
Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation
Patients with non-valvular AF irrespective of whether the pattern is paroxysmal,
persistent, permanent or achieved apparently successful rhythm control, should be
considered for anticoagulation to reduce their stroke risk.582,583
The stroke risk is calculated using the CHA2DS2-VASc score as in Table 22, pg
109.520,583
The rate of stroke is 0.2%, 1.3%, and 2.2% per year for CHA2DS2-VASc scores of
0, 1, and 2 respectively.582
In patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of:
•
>1 in males and >2 in females anticoagulation is recommended
•
1 in males and 2 in females anticoagulation should be individualized after a
discussion with the patient.
•
0 and those with lone AF (strictly defined, irrespective of gender) have very low
absolute stroke risk. It may be reasonable not to consider these group of
individuals for antithrombotic treatment.582-584

Anticoagulation in these patients may be achieved by:582,583
•
Warfarin
•
Newer Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC)
The NOACs have been shown to cause less bleeding and are superior to
warfarin in preventing stroke. They also do not require regular blood
monitoring.
In patients with AF who have undergone PCI and stenting with drug eluting
stents, a recent study showed that the use of NOAC with antiplatelet therapy
is associated with a lower risk of bleeding than the standard triple therapy
(DAPT + warfarin).585 The following regimens are recommended:
•
Rivaroxaban 15 mg daily (10mg if eGFR: 30 to 50 ml per minute) +
clopidogrel 75 mg daily (or ticagrelor at a dose of 90 mg twice daily or
prasugrel at a dose of 10 mg once daily)
•
Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BD and DAPT - aspirin 75 to 100 mg per day +
clopidogrel 75 mg once daily (or ticagrelor at a dose of 90 mg twice daily
or prasugrel at a dose of 10 mg once daily) - The duration of DAPT will
depend on the risk of stent thrombosis versus bleeding risk. This dose of
rivaroxaban is yet to be registered in Malaysia
9.4.2.2 Valvular Atrial Fibrillation and Prosthetic Heart Valves
Patients with AF due to valve disease or prosthetic heart valves should be
anticoagulated with warfarin.580
9.4.2.3 Left Ventricular Thrombus
Recent studies have shown that the incidence of mural thrombus after a
large anterior MI varies 6-15% and in individuals with anterior MI and left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% is about 27%.586,587 The use of
warfarin in the pre-thrombolytic and pre-primary PCI era, has been shown to
reduce the incidence of mural thrombus and embolization.588 However at
present, most patients are already on DAPT, and the addition of warfarin has
been associated with increased bleeding.589

<40%.580
In patients with LV thrombus demonstrated by echocardiography following a
recent MI:
•
Warfarin may be considered in addition to DAPT for at least 3 months in:
 Patient with non-ischaemic stroke with TIA580
 Without prior stroke or TIA
•
In patients with high risk of bleeding, warfarin plus antiplatelet
monotherapy may be considered.
Recommendations:
•
For the use of anti platelet therapy in the primary and secondary
prevention of CVD, see Table 20, pg 99.
•
In patients with a recent non-cardio-embolic ischemic stroke or TIA:

Aspirin is recommended

Clopidogrel is reasonable option in individuals who are allergic or

10. Adherence to Therapy
The WHO defines adherence as the extent to which a person’s behavior – taking
medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes – corresponds with
agreed recommendations from a health care provider.590
Full adherence to medication that have been proven to prevent CVD (aspirin, BP
and cholesterol lowering drugs) has been estimated to reduce the risk of a first or
second CVD event by approximately 80%.591 However, even among high risk
post-MI patients, only 43% were fully adherent to treatment after six months and this
declined to 34% after one year.592 Low adherence rate leads to adverse outcomes,
higher hospitalization rates and increased costs.590,592,593
10.1
Prevalence
Locally, only approximately 44-53% of patients on long-term therapy adhere to their
medication.594-596 This varies from 48.7% in a hospital based practice to 53.4%
among hypertensive patients treated in primary care clinics.595,596 In another study
conducted in primary care, 56% were non-compliant towards antihypertensive,
anti-diabetic and anti-asthmatic medication592 These rates are similar to studies
done elsewhere.597 Generally, adherence rates to secondary prevention (66%) are
better than for primary prevention (50%).597
10.2
Management
The reasons for decreased adherence are often multi-factorial and include the
following590 (Table 23, pg 113):
•
Patient factors- especially depression598
•
Healthcare system
•
Condition
•
Therapy
•
Socioeconomic factors
10.2.1
Interventions to Promote Adherence
Interventions to improve medication adherence are only modestly effective.599
Fixed-dose combination therapy (polypill) is associated with reductions in BP and
lipid parameters and improved adherence.600 However, there was modest increases
in adverse events compared with placebo, single drug active component, or usual
care.600
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Other helpful clinical practice points include (Table 24, pg 115):
•
Assessing adherence to medication at each visit
•
Asking empathic questions, acknowledging likelihood of non-adherence and
encouraging an open discussion
•
Using a screening questionnaire
•
Reviewing refill frequency601,602
•
Identifying reasons (non-judgmentally) for non-adherence601,602
To promote adherence:
•
Provide clear instructions on the benefits and possible adverse effects of
medications, duration and timing of dose602
•
Consider patients’ perspective602
•
Simplify regimen593,602,603
•
Practice regular monitoring (including self-monitoring) and feedback,
reinforcement and reminders604,605
•
Involve allied health care providers, such as pharmacists and nurses
•
Refer to medication therapy adherence clinics and for cardiac
rehabilitation599,606

11. Community, Population and Governmental Level
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major health burden to the country.
Preventive care ensures a healthy population leading to a reduction in the
expenditure for curative care. This is the focus of the healthcare sector in the current
11th Malaysia Plan. Health education and promotion (including media campaigns) are
important in raising awareness and knowledge. However, by themselves, these are
inadequate in achieving behavioural change. Essentially, we need “pro-health”
national policies to achieve positive behavioural changes.
In accordance with the recommendations of WHO.608 Malaysia has adopted a
“whole-of-government” approach to effectively prevent NCDs with strong and
proactive involvement of many ministries and stakeholders. The 3 main modifiable
CV risk factors – unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and smoking – have to be tackled
simultaneously. This involves individual behavioural modification, as well as policy
and regulatory interventions.
Malaysians need to take on more responsibility for their own health. As such, the
MOH puts a high priority on empowering individuals and communities to take on
self-care responsibilities and becoming a resource for themselves and others in
disease prevention and management. This is done through the KOmuniti Sihat,
Perkasa Negara (KOSPEN) Program (Section 11.4, pg 122).
National policies for the prevention of CVD has focused on the following main areas:
•
Tobacco control
•
Salt reduction
•
Modifying the obesogenic environment
•
Others: KOSPEN
11.1
Tobacco Control
11.1.1
Legislation for Tobacco Control in Malaysia
Tobacco control in Malaysia is regulated under the Control for Tobacco Products
Regulations (CPTR) 2004, a component of the Food Act 1983. CPTR 2004 replaced
the old CPTR 1993, and was developed based on the WHO Framework Convention
for Tobacco Control (FCTC). Malaysia became a signatory to this convention on 23
September 2003, ratified it on 16 September 2005, and officially became a party 90
days later on 15 December 2005.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
At the ministry level, the Tobacco Control and FCTC Sector under the NCD Section,
Disease Control Division, serves as the country’s focal point for WHO FCTC and all
issues related to tobacco control. A National FCTC Driving Committee comprising of
various governmental ministries and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was
also formed to ensure better implementation of the FCTC requirements in Malaysia.
11.1.2 The National Strategic Plan for Tobacco Control 2015-2020
Malaysia developed the National Strategic Plan for Tobacco Control 2015-2020 in
line with FCTC.609 The global NCD target is a smoking prevalence of <15% by 2025.
The eventual goal is a smoking prevalence of <5% and this is called the end game
for tobacco consumption (The End Game).
There are four strategies outlined in this national plan in accordance with the WHO
MPOWER Strategy as listed below:
•
To strengthen tobacco control capacity
•
To strengthen tobacco control enforcement and legislation
•
To empower community and to increase multi-sectoral collaboration
•
To strengthen tobacco control activities through MPOWER strategies (Table 25,
pg 117)
A selected list of current activities under the National Strategic Plan is shown in Table
26, pg 119.

11.2
Salt Reduction
Salt reduction is the simplest and most cost-effective measure for reducing CVD
because of its high impact on health, high feasibility and low implementation costs.610
Based on Malaysia’s latest burden of disease study, high BP is estimated to
contribute to 42.2% of deaths and 21.6% of disability adjusted life year (DALY), the
largest contributor for both men and women.611
A 24-hour urine analysis is considered as the gold standard method to estimate salt
intake in the population as compared to data obtained through dietary surveys which
generally tend to underestimate salt/sodium intake. A study conducted in a
sub-population in Malaysia in 2012 showed an average salt intake of 8.7 g/day (or
3.4 g/day sodium), about 1.7 times higher than WHO’s recommendation.612

Salt Reduction Strategy 2015-2020
The general objective of the Salt Reduction Strategy is to promote, educate and
collaborate with all related stakeholders to reduce salt intake among the Malaysian
population, working towards achieving a 30% reduction in the average daily salt
intake (from 8.7 g/day to 6.0 g/day) of the adult population by year 2025.613 Based on
the major sources of dietary salt/sodium in Malaysia (non-processed food),
modification of the population’s behaviour would have the biggest impact, but
unfortunately the interventions would be the most challenging.

Activities
1.
Strengthening the Smoking Cessation Services
The mQuit services614 is a public-private initiative that aims to improve access to smoking cessation services. This was
introduced in 2016 to give smokers to obtain three levels of support, namely professional advice, materials to help quit smoking
and enlisting the smoker’s own willpower. Smokers will have the ease to get professional help from either the government
health clinics or hospital, or from the private sector such as the community pharmacies.
The delivery of the services is standardised through the national Clinical Practice Guidelines on Treatment of Tobacco
Dependence615. On top of that, a national Quitline was established to help and guide smokers to quit through behavioural
intervention through telephone calls.
2.
School programs to develop a Smokefree Malaysian Generation
Preventative programme: Implementation of the IMFree Program616 This is an educational program for smoking prevention
among primary school children age 7 to 12 years. Some components of the IMFree Program are also implemented in preschools under the Tunas Doktor Muda Program throughout the country.
Intervention programme: The majority of smokers had their first cigarette before the age of 14 years old. Therefore, intervention
programmes for school children are deemed essential.
•
The Kesihatan Oral Tanpa Asap Rokok (KOTAK) is a new initiative but as an extension to the existing
Incremental School Dental Care programme. In this programme school children who are detected as smokers will
be given interventions to help them beat smoking.
•
A new Guidance for Helping School Children Who Smoke was developed to give guidance to school counsellors on
how to manage school children who smoke. This approach is a curative approach rather than punitive. Smokers will
be coached on how to quit smoking properly.
3.
Empowering the community
To empower the communities to stop smoking and creating smoke-free environments through the KOSPEN Program.
KOSPEN is currently a flagship program led by the MOH for community-based NCD risk factor screening and intervention.
(more information on KOSPEN in Section 11.4)
Specifically, for smoking, smokers identified through the screening are referred for quit smoking services available in their area.
The KOSPEN volunteers could have a great influence in encouraging their fellow community members to quit smoking properly
through professional smoking cessation in their local area.
4.
Protecting the public from the dangers of tobacco smoke
•
Through volunteerism: To reduce exposure to second-hand smoke, houses in the KOSPEN area are encouraged
to commit to “My Smokefree Home” declaration and all community events declared “Smoke-free”. On the other
hand, the Blue Ribbon5 programme is a voluntarily smoke free declaration in public places such as businesses,
eateries and other community places.
•
Gazettement of Smoke-Free Places by law: Smoking is generally prohibited on public transportation. Smoking is
prohibited in specified public places and workplaces listed in the regulations including, among others, in workplaces
with a centralized air-conditioning system; health, education, government and cultural facilities; and indoor stadiums.
Smoking is also prohibited on floors with a service counter in banks, financial institutions, national telecom
company, national energy company and post offices. Expansion of places to be gazetted as smoke-free place is
being undertaken; most recently the rest & respite areas of the federal highways – and will include all hotels, public
parks and all restaurants.
5.
Other Tobacco Control Activities
•
Tobacco Packaging and Labeling: Rotating combined picture and text health warnings are required to occupy
50% of the front and 60% of the back of the package. The text of the warning is in Malay on the front panel and
English on the back panel. Misleading packaging and labeling, including terms such as “light” and “low tar” and
other signs, is prohibited. Efforts are currently being undertaken to move towards “plain packaging”.
•
Increase in tobacco excise tax: Fiscal measure is one of the best option for reducing demand for cigarettes. It is
also a great deterrent for non-smoker to take up smoking. WHO FCTC encourages countries to raise their tobacco
taxes to at least 75% of the retail price.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Through Monitoring-Awareness-Product (M-A-P) strategies, Malaysia hopes to build
upon the existing framework to strengthen current interventions. A selected list of
activities under the Salt Reduction Strategy is shown in Table 27, pg 120.
Table 27: Selected List of Salt Reduction Activities in Malaysia
Activities
1.
Strategy 1: Monitoring
A database on the salt content of processed foods with data available to the public is being
planned for 2018. This will assist the public in their decision during purchasing and enables
monitoring the trends of salt content of the processed foods over time.
2.
Strategy 2: Awareness
Mass media and social marketing (using alternative media) are very important methodologies
to educate on the relationship between salt, hypertension and heart attacks and strokes to
the general population. The public also needs to be educated on salt content of foods, how
to reduce salt intake and understand salt/sodium labelling.
Within specific settings, for example, school canteens, catering in the public services
sector, hospital foods or food outlets in hospitals and health facilities, administrative
guidelines are being introduce in a step-wise manner to reduce salt content in food
preparations.
3.
Strategy 3: Product
MOH will continue the current partnership with food industries on food reformulation. This is
currently being undertaken by focusing on selected food categories, setting targets for
reduction.
MOH is also in the process of making salt content labeling as mandatory for all processed
food (target date: 2018). This is important for educating the population to identify healthier
choices, and also to inform MOH to engage with food industries to reduce the salt content in
their products.

11.3
Modifying the Obesogenic Environment
In July 2014, the MOH requested the formation of a national level task force to tackle
obesity in Malaysia. This comprised experts from the government, academia,
professional organizations and NGOs. The final recommendations was presented
and approved by the MOH in 2016.
It was based on the current scientific evidence of cost-effectiveness. In addition to
cost-effectiveness, considerations were also given on affordability, implementation
capacity, feasibility and perceived acceptability by the population. A selected list of
hard policy interventions currently being pursued by the government is shown in
Table 28, pg 121.
Table 28: Selected List of Hard Policy Interventions in Malaysia
Activities
1.
“Healthy schools”: Policy options for school setting. This includes:
•
Revision of list of food and beverages allowed to be sold in school canteens.
•
Ban of selling of food and beverages within 40 meters outside of school perimeter
(except for licensed vendor complying with the list of food and beverages allowed).
•
Ban of marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children in print and fixed
outdoor advertising within 300 metres of schools (media, bus stops, billboards).
•
Mandatory to provide free, clean and safe water (water fountain/ dispenser) in
schools.
2.
General setting
•
Increase consumption and access to affordable and fresh vegetables (including ulam)
and fruits by increasing the number of Pasar Tani outlets.
•
Banning television advertising of foods and beverages high in fat and/or high in sugar
that is appealing to children.
•
Excise and/or GST on unhealthy foods (foods high in fats, salt and sugars) e.g.
sweetened creamer, condensed milk, sugar sweetened beverages, carbonated
drinks, juices and processed foods.
•
Increase availability of facilities in the community to promote PA and exercise in a safe
environment (e.g. public parks, public sport complexes, jogging and cycling paths and
public gymnasium).
•
Mandatory for local authorities to provide cyclists and pedestrians safe and accessible
sidewalks, walking paths and cycling paths.
•
Mandatory for local media to allocate more airtime and advertisement space during
appropriate time slot for promotion of PA.
•
Mandatory to relocate street stalls to hawker centres for the purpose of ensuring
opening time, food safety and healthier choices.
•
Reduce cooking oil subsidies.
•
Restrict the number of new food outlets including 24-hours food outlets within 400
metres radius of new residential areas.

KOSPEN: For the Community, by the Community
This is an NCD risk factor community-based intervention program developed in
response to the increasing prevalence of NCD risk factors, as well as to empower
the population to take more responsibility on their own health status. It is known as
Komuniti Sihat Perkasa Negara (KOSPEN). The program aims at bringing the NCD
risk factor related activities to the community by creating trained health volunteers,
who will function as “agents of change” or health enablers who will introduce and
facilitate healthy living practices amongst their respective community.
The main objectives of KOSPEN are to:
•
Empower the community in adopting and practicing healthy lifestyles and
•
Enhance their participation and involvement in programs aiming at preventing
and controlling NCD in Malaysia.
This program was launched in 2014. Its main scope is promoting a healthy diet,
active living, non-smoking, weight management and routine community NCD risk
factor screening.
The MOH is currently collaborating with the Ministry of Rural and Regional
Development (through the Department of Community Development or KEMAS) in
implementing KOSPEN in rural areas, and collaborating with the Department of
National Unity and Integration (through Rukun Tetangga) for urban and sub-urban
areas.
A group of health volunteers within the identified residences or community registered
under both collaborating agencies are provided with training that will enable them to
promote healthy behaviours, advocate for healthy policy adoption and facilitate
environmental changes within the local community. These trained volunteers are
also capable of conducting basic health screening consisting of measuring blood
pressure, blood glucose levels and BMI. They also conduct semi-structured
interventions, and those at high risk would be referred to nearby health clinics for
further investigation and management.
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
11.4.1 Status of Implementation
As of December 2016, 5,900 KOSPEN localities or sites have been established
throughout Malaysia, with more than 36,000 volunteers trained. Within the localities,
almost 400,000 adult residents have been screened for NCD risk factors; about 75%
have been referred for diabetes confirmatory tests, 35% for hypertension and 9% for
obesity class 2 (BMI ≥35 kg/m²).
To date, KOSPEN volunteers have conducted weight management programs in 200
KOSPEN localities. Initial analysis indicates that 90% of the programs have
successfully achieved their targets.
In 2017, further work will be done to further strengthen the NCD risk factor
intervention components as well as exploring options in ensuring the sustainability of
the KOSPEN program. In addition, 2017 will see the implementation of KOSPEN+,
a workplace-based NCD risk factor intervention program to be implemented in a
stepwise manner. This is to be done in collaboration with both public and the private
sectors.

12. Traditional and Complimentary Medicine
12.1
Definition of Terms and Concepts
Traditional medicine, by WHO definition,617 is the sum total of the knowledge, skills,
and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different
cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in
the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.
In Malaysia, it identifies strongly with the respective ethnic cultures and is often
considered as an important part of their cultural heritage.
Complementary medicine refers to a broad set of healthcare practices that are not
part of that country’s own traditional or conventional medicine and are not fully
integrated into the dominant healthcare system.618 It is often used together with
conventional medicine.
Alternative medicine, on the other hand, is used in place of conventional medicine.
In Malaysia, the Traditional and Complementary Medicine ACT 775, (2016)619
defines the practice of T&CM as a form of health-related practice designated to
prevent, treat or manage ailment or illness or preserve the mental and physical
well-being of an individual. The handbook on T&CM outlines the program in
Malaysia.618
According to the Act 775, T&CM practices includes:
•
Traditional Malay medicine
•
Traditional Chinese medicine
•
Traditional Indian medicine
•
Islamic medical practice
•
Homeopathy and
•
Complementary therapies
It excludes medical and dental practices used by medical and dental practitioners
respectively. (Appendix 12, pg 177-178)
TCM stands for Traditional Chinese Medicine whereas T&CM is abbreviation for
Traditional and Complementary Medicine. There are many more abbreviations and
terms which appear frequently in many T&CM related literatures and documents
which at time may cause confusion without knowing the context of source
document. Visit web site Globinmed for further detail. (http://www.globinmed.com/)
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
12.2
Utilisation of T&CM
According to data from NHMS 2015, about 29.25% of the population had ever used
any form of T&CM with consultation.620 For use within the last 12 months, females
showed significantly higher usage (23.98%) compared to males (19.33%).620 A
higher percentage of the urban population (22.64%) were more likely to use T&CM
compared to the rural population (18.23%).620
The survey showed that T&CM practices were mainly used to maintain wellness.
When T&CM was used as treatment, the intended use was for primary healthcare
and complementary treatment. About 18.3% of those surveyed intended to use of
T&CM as an alternative treatment.620
In a survey conducted in a rural setting, 31.7% (about 1 in 3) of about 2,800
respondents with CV risk factors were using T&CM, and 20-30% of these were using
this as a substitute to their conventional medicine.621
There has been no specific research conducted locally on the use of T&CM by
patients with CVD. Research from Australia and the USA show the following
trends:622-627
•
The prevalence of T&CM use is high and fast growing.
•
There is lack of sound, evidence-based professional resources for reliable
information about the safety and efficacy of T&CM treatments on CVD.
•
There exists a patient-doctor communication gap.
•
Patients’ reluctance to communicate about T&CM use with medical doctors out
of fear of disapproval is just as significant a problem as health professionals’
hesitancy to discuss this topic with their patients.
•
Most medical doctor and pharmacists believe that they lack the resources and
training to respond to patients’ inquiries about T&CM use.
The areas of concern mentioned above require long term efforts in education and
research by all the stakeholders.
In short term, frequent interaction, exchange of idea as well as information with
credible T&CM practitioners specialised in CVD through periodic seminar, workshop
and conference may be helpful in promoting mutual understanding. Malaysia
Medical Association organises evidence based T&CM seminars on a yearly basis.

12.3
T&CM and CVD
Many forms of T&CM base their information on traditional philosophy or belief
system rather than relying on existing scientific research.
12.3.1 Acupuncture & Qi Gong for Hypertension
Two randomized controlled trials have produced conflicting results on the
effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing BP.628, 629
Meta-analysis have found that it does not reduce BP on its own. However it is
a useful adjunct to drug therapy.630,631
Acupuncture, although generally safe, has been associated with a small risk
of infection from the use of contaminated needles and rarely, damage to
major organs.632
The committee does not recommend acupuncture as a form of blood
pressure lowering therapy.
There is some evidence that qi gong lowers diastolic BP, but the
conclusiveness of these findings is limited.633,634
12.3.2 Mind Body Practices (Appendix 13, pg 179)
Meditation and spiritual healing are mind based therapies that are relatively
safe and influence physical health through psychosocial and behavioural
pathways.635 They help to cope with stress, improve emotional health and
general well-being.635
Mind body practices have a positive impact on CV health.636
12.3.3 Herbal Medicine
Herbal medicine does not belong to the traditional system of medicine. The
National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency has categorised natural
products into:
•
traditional products
•
herbal products and
•
health supplement products
IIa,B
III,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Herbal medicines have herbal ingredients but are not traditional products. They are
different from herbal preparations used in the various T&CM practices and are not
based on the philosophy of the respective traditional medicine and documented
traditional history of use.
Many of these herbal medicines appear to have pharmacological effects in vitro and
in animal studies.637 However, the evidence from properly conducted clinical trials is
generally insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.637
In addition, there are several issues regarding the characterization of botanical
products.637 This includes whether the whole extract or a specific fraction was used,
the method of extraction (e.g. alcoholic, tea, pressed juice), and the chemical and
genetic standardization of the product.637
Some herbal medicines that have been used to treat CVD include:638-640
•
Plant sources of cardiac glycosides - digitoxin, derived from either D purpurea
(foxglove) or Digitalis lanata, and digoxin, derived from D. lanata alone. These
have been used for the treatment of heart failure.
•
Reserpine from Rauwolfia serpentina (snakeroot), Evodia rutaecarpa
(wu-chu-yu) and Stephania tetrandra have been used in traditional Chinese
medicine to treat hypertension.
•
Garlic and guggulipid have been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat
hyperlipidemia.
•
Extracts of Chinese red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) containing several
active ingredients, including monacolin K, which has the same chemical
structure as lovastatin, can lower LDL-C.
•
The fruit of the hawthorn (usually Crataegus pinnatifida; known as shanzha) is
widely used for many indications, including digestive disorders and for lowering
cholesterol and blood pressure.
•
The dried root of S. miltiorrhiza, known as danshen in TCM, is widely used in
China for the treatment of angina pectoris, hyperlipidemia, and acute ischemic
stroke
•
G. biloba extract (GBE) has been used for treating cerebral insufficiency and
its symptoms of vertigo, tinnitus, memory loss, and mood disorder. A
placebo-controlled study of GBE administered at 120 mg twice daily found no
effect on cognitive decline in older adults with normal cognition or with mild
cognitive impairment.641
•
The root of P. notoginseng is also often used in the treatment of patients with
angina and CAD.
•
Oral aloe vera has been shown to reduce FBG and HbA1c (by as much as
1.05%).642
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Herbal medicine has no strong quantitative scientific evidence of its efficacy in
CV risk and event reduction.
It however has the possibility of potential harm in view of the narrow
therapeutic index of some preparations and also due to interaction with
allopathic medications.637-639
Some examples include but not limited to the following:
•
The concomitant use of hawthorn with cardiac glycosides can markedly
enhance their activity and cause digoxin toxicity.
•
Aristolochia fangchi has been implicated in an outbreak of rapidly
progressive renal failure, termed Chinese herb nephropathy. It is also
associated with urothelial cancer.643,644
•
Interaction between S. miltiorrhiza and warfarin. There have been
several case reports of increased anticoagulation or haemorrhage.
•
Aloe vera may interact with oral hypoglycemics and insulin and cause
hypoglycaemia.642
Herbal medicine should be used with caution in the prevention and treatment
of CVD.645
12.4.
Role of T&CM in the prevention of CVD
There are unique features of T&CM as practised in Malaysia that can be
harnessed to contribute to the nationwide CVD prevention strategy.646
•
The practice is strongly identified with the respective ethnic cultures and is
considered as important cultural heritages.
•
Almost all the 14,000 or so T&CM practitioners establish their practice at
the primary health care level. They stay close to the grass roots and
establish symbiotic relationships with local cultural institutions such as
temples, mosques, schools and other NGOs. They can become strong
opinion leaders among the grass roots that can influence individual and
community behavior and participation in health strategies.
•
The practice is multi-cultural and highly diversified. These rich cultural
resources provide us with plenty of ready-made inputs that increase the
attractiveness of our health related initiatives and activities. For example,
in addition to the common sporting events, Qigong, Tai Chi, Yoga and
Senaman Melayu Tua can be used to encourage more physical activities.
•
Many of the practices are rich in the area of health maintenance
especially lifestyle modification, physical activities, appropriate diet and
maintaining a healthy environment leading to emotional, psychological
and spiritual well being of the individual. The government agencies and
NGOs can galvanize the T&CM groups to work together towards the
achievement of health promotion efforts.
IIb,C
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
However, there are also weaknesses in the T&CM industry. While there are a
small number of credible practitioners, most of them require further training
and upgrading of their knowledge before they can contribute positively to the
prevention strategy.
These practitioners should not replace conventional mainstream health
professionals as sources of medical advice for the prevention of CVD.
The practice of TCM is based on TCM evidence rather than scientific
evidence. Even the terminology CVD is being interpreted based on pathology
and physiology of conventional medicine and not based on the TCM
philosophy. While they make a lot of reference to scientific investigations such
as laboratory and imaging investigation, they draw on TCM’s profound and
unique philosophy of Yin Yang and Five Element theories for diagnosis,
treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. The object of TCM treatment is not
CVD itself but to restore the disharmony of Yin Yang. TCM has it unique,
complete and time tested body of knowledge and theories which follow a
pathway different from conventional medicine and which existed long before
the birth of modern science.
A meta-analysis found insufficient or conflicting evidence for the use of TCM
in CVD prevention.645
T&CM practices such as Traditional Indian Medicine and Homeopathy have
claimed benefits in the prevention and treatment of CVD. However, there is no
good scientific data in the form of randomized controlled trial or systemic
reviews. This is because it involves different philosophical systems and
methodologies.
Currently, only TCM offers professionalized and specialized services to
patients with CVD. Patients are given outpatient consultations in the area of
life style modification, Chinese medicine concoction for maintenance of
health, dietary advice and management of CV risk factors. More information,
may be obtained via Globinmed (http://www.globinmed.com/).
Recommendations:
•
Herbal medicine, acupuncture and other forms of T&CM should be used
with caution in the prevention and treatment of CVD.
•
TCM practitioners should not replace conventional mainstream health
professionals as sources of medical advice for the prevention of CVD.

13. Miscellaneous Frequently Asked Questions and
Myths
13.1
Chelation Therapy
Chelation therapy (CT) is defined as the use of repeated administration of
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) with or without the combination of
vitamins, trace elements and iron supplements as an alternative treatment
option for vascular diseases. It is given via an intravenous concoction of
infusions, often several days apart for 20 to 30 sessions. It is proven therapy
and is efficacious in heavy metal poisoning involving lead, iron and other
metals.647
The evidence to support the use of CT in prevention of CVD is extremely weak
and should be avoided.648-653
There are risks associated with CT. Renal failure, arrhythmias, tetany,
hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hypotension, bone marrow depression,
prolonged bleeding time, convulsions, respiratory arrest, and autoimmune
diseases have all been described.
Until further data is available, CT cannot be recommended as an option for the
treatment or prevention of CVD.648-653
13.2
Ozone
Ozone is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula O3. It is a
controversial gas because, owing to its potent oxidant properties, it exerts
damaging effects on the respiratory tract and yet it has been used for decades
as researchers believes it has many therapeutic effects.654-656 Hence, due to
its toxic effects on the respiratory tract, it should never be given via
inhalation.657 Medical O3 is used to disinfect equipment by inactivation of
bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast and protozoa.658 It is also used in dental
practice.658,659 There have been claims that it activates the immune system but
there is no scientific evidence to support this.658
The gas produced from medical grade oxygen is administered in precise
therapeutic doses.
III,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
13.2.1 Effects of Ozone Therapy
Ozone has not been established scientifically as an antioxidant and/ or
immunomodulant. Clinical trials have not shown ozone to be beneficial in
patients with CVD (CHD, limb ischaemia and/ or stroke)660,661
Ozone therapy has the potential for harm. During administration, it may result
in air embolism,662 myocardial infarction,663 stroke664, visual loss665 and blood
borne infections such as hepatitis, HIV.666,667
Current data on the usage of ozone therapy as therapeutic options for CVD
are insufficient in regards to safety and therapeutic advantage over available
treatment currently.668
There is a lack of clinical evidence for ozone therapy as a form of
complementary or alternative treatment. It is not recommended.
The Malaysian Medical Council prohibits any registered medical doctor from
practicing ozone therapy.669
13.3
Stem Cells
Stem cells is being promoted as a form of regenerative therapy. However,
currently there is little evidence to support the use of stem cells in the
prevention or treatment of CVD.670,671
13.4
Anti-aging (vascular aging)
Telomeres are essential parts of human cells (chromosomes) that affect how
our cells age. The length of telomeres is a biomarker of age, a shorter
telomere length is associated with older age, atherosclerosis and other CV
risk factors such as hypertension, adiposity, diabetes, smoking and physical
inactivity.
A healthy lifestyle, increased physical activity and appropriate drug use (e.g.
statins for hypercholesterolemia) prevent shortening of the telomere, reduces
the risk of atherosclerosis and also improves life expectancy by anti-aging
effects.672
III,B
IIb,B
Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease 2017
Several agents such as metformin and reserveterol have been thought to
slow the ageing process. At present, there is insufficient evidence that they do
so.673,674
The use of hormones (growth hormones, TRT, placental hormone, stem cells
etc) has not been proven to have any anti-aging effects and has the potential
for harm.
The committee does not recommend the use of hormones as anti-aging
agents.
Recommendations:
•
There is no role for chelation therapy, ozone therapy, stem cells or anti
aging therapy in the prevention or treatment of CVD.

14. Monitoring of Activity and Quality Assurance
Implementation of the recommendations listed in this CPG can be accomplished by:
•
Continuous medical education via regular seminars, lectures and roadshows
particularly at the district hospital and family medicine clinics. Education and
training is the most important aspect of the implementation of this CPG.
•
Widespread availability of this CPG to healthcare providers via printed copies,
electronic websites, etc.
The national NCD targets for Malaysia by year 2025 are shown in Table 29, pg 133.

APPENDIX 12: FORMS OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE
Traditional Malay Medicine (TMM):
• Is based on knowledge inherited from generation to generation among the Malay
community.
• Has the largest user group.
There are four major practice areas in TMM:
• Traditional Malay Massage (Urut Melayu)- This is a massage technique comprising of kneading,
stroking and pressing with hands and application of herbal oils to ease the massage. The
practitioner uses his/her thumbs, palms, elbows and/or feet in applying a sustained mechanical
pressure during massage. Sometime massage tool such as wooden stick, comb, and horn may
be used as an aid during the massage. Traditional Malay massage may involve recitation of
prayers.
• Malay Herbs- Herbs are used as a complement therapy in TMM in the treatment of a disease or
enhancement of wellness. It may consist of any part of a plant such as root, leaf or stem, either
dry or fresh.
• Cupping- This is a form of traditional medicine found in many cultures world-wide. TMM
practitioners do not combine other forms of practices (such as herbal prescription) during or
after cupping
• Postnatal care- There are three unique features in Malay postnatal care: the use of herbs, the
use of heat and Malay postnatal massage. Malays are the main users.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
• Is based on knowledge inherited from generation to generation among the Chinese community
grounded on a profound philosophy of Yin Yang and Five Element.
TCM uses many forms of treatment methods, the major methods being:
• Chinese herbs and material medica that involve mineral substance and animal components
may be combined to form concoction. This is the most important method used to treat various
diseases and manage the health of individual.
• Acupuncture, acupressure, Tuina, moxibustion, cupping and Guasa- These are the physical or
mechanical treatment methods often use together under the guidance of the Meridian Theory,
Yin Yang and Five Element Theory.

Acupuncture needles are suitable for deep but small area stimulation of human body.

Cupping and Guasa are suitable for large but superficial stimulation of skin area.

Acupressure is method of the choice when relatively mild stimulation is indicated or when
there is no suitable equipment available.

Moxibustion provides stimulation of acupuncture points and heat therapy simultaneously.

Tuina is a form of manipulative treatment method use for treatment of certain disease
and health condition. The practitioner can use a range of motion, traction, and massage
with the stimulation of acupuncture points.
• Qigong- This is a practice of aligning body, breath and mind to cultivate and balance qi or what
has been translated as “life energy”.

APPENDIX 12: FORMS OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE (cont’d)
Traditional Indian medicine (TIM)
Has 5 major forms:
• Ayurveda means “science of life”. The principal objectives of Ayurveda are maintenance and
promotion of health, prevention of disease and cure of sickness. It is a famous practice in North
India. It is a system based on 5 elements-space, air, fire, water and earth; and treatment concept
based on balance of the three elemental substances. These elemental substances combine in
the human body to form three life forces or energies, the Doshas. The Doshas consist of Vata
(kinetic energy), Pitta (thermal energy), Kapha (potential energy) that governs physiological and
psychological functions of the body. An equal balance of the 3 doshas leads to health, while
imbalance in them leads to disease. Ayurveda emphasizes on Dietary Principles (Ahara Niyma),
Daily regimen (Ritucharya), Good conduct/social behaviour (Sadavritta), the use of plant based
medicines and treatments.
• Siddha came from the word siddhi, which means perfection of heavenly bliss. Siddha system
gained popularity in South India especially in Tamil Nadu. Siddha medicine is a form of the TIM
that uses a therapeutic concept. It is assumed that when the normal equilibrium of the three
humors (Vaadham, Pittham and Kabam) is disturbed, disease is caused. The factors, assumed
to affect this equilibrium, are environment, climatic condition, diet, physical activities, and stress.
According to the siddha medical system, diet and life style play a major role, not only in health
but also in curing disease.
• Unani is a form of TIM practiced mostly by Indian Muslim. According to its teachings, the body
is comprised of four basic elements (earth, air, water and fire) and four humors (blood, phlegm,
yellow bile, and black bile). Equilibrium in the humor indicates good health while a disturbance
in this equilibrium results in disease.
• Yoga is a practice that involves physical movement, mental focus and spiritual strength. It
originates from ancient India. The aim is to achieve a peaceful state of mind. Yoga also has been
popularly defined as “union with the divine” in the context of other traditions. It has eight folds or
paths that advocate certain restraints and observances, physical discipline, breath regulations,
contemplation, meditation and Samadhi.
• Naturopathy- Practitioners often recommend the use of natural materials, such as sunlight,
herbs and certain foods, as well as the activities that are supposed to be natural, such as
exercise, meditation and relaxation. They claim that natural treatment helps restore the body’s
natural ability to heal itself without the adverse effects of conventional drugs. This treatment is
offered through consultations.
Homeopathy
This is a system based on Samuel Hahneman’s doctrine of “like cures like”, according to which a
substance that causes the symptoms of disease in healthy people will cure similar symptoms in sick
people. Hahneman believed that the underlying causes of disease were phenomena that he termed
miasms and homeopathic remedies addressed these. Homeopathy remedies are based on plant,
mineral and animal substances.
Islamic medical practice
Islamic medical practice is used in the treatment of physical and spiritual ailments. It is performed by
a Muslim who is knowledgeable and skilled in treatment methods or materials permitted by the Islamic
law. The practitioner uses Quranic verses, Hadith, the practices of the pious and righteous scholars
and venerated religious teachers.
