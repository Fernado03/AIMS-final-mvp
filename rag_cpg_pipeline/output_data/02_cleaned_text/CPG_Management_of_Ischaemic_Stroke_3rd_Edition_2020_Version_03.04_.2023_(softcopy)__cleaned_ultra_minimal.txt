STATEMENT OF INTENT
This guideline was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice, based on the best available
evidence at the time of development. Specific attempts were made to use local data and publications
to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not necessarily lead to the best clinical
outcome in individual patient care. Every healthcare provider is responsible for the management of
his/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation and management options available locally.
REVIEW AND UPDATE OF THE GUIDELINE
This guideline was issued in 2020 and will be reviewed in 2025 or earlier if important new evidence
becomes available. When they are due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of
the related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be held on the need for a revision,
including on the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed, and the latest
systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

SOURCE OF FUNDING
Rationale
Acute ischaemic stroke continues to be a major cause of morbidity and is currently the third leading
cause of mortality in Malaysia. With current advancement, timely intervention, and early reperfusion
either via medical thrombolysis or endovascular treatment, the outcome of stroke has improved
significantly. The biggest challenge in Malaysia is the limited availability, not only in terms of a
dedicated stroke unit in a major hospital but also the availability of reperfusion therapy, particularly
mechanical thrombectomy. Furthermore, the lack of community awareness on the importance of
timely hyperacute intervention for stroke in Malaysia is still prominent.
The 1st Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on the management of ischaemic stroke was published in
2006 and the second edition was published in 2012. Since then, there was a rapid development in
the management of acute stroke, mainly with the improvement and advancement of reperfusion
therapy, encompassing both medical thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Furthermore, the
importance of timely intervention, especially in the emergency department, had significantly
improved the outcome in stroke patients. Therefore, this current CPG emphasizes the hyperacute
management and has introduced new chapters, for example, emergency medical services. With the
growing numbers of elderly population in Malaysia, we have also included a new chapter on stroke in
the older person. This 3rd edition was developed to provide a clear and concise approach based on
current evidence with the focus being on the efforts to reduce time and improve pre-hospital care.
We have summarised and adapted relevant clinical trials data and published literatures to our local
practice.
This CPG has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the Malaysia Stroke Council
(MSC), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE). The committee
members were multidisciplinary and comprised of neurologists, internal medicine physicians,
geriatricians, and emergency physicians from the government sector, private sector, and universities.
The external reviewers included were also consultants from multidisciplinary branches of medicine.
Patient and stroke carer groups were, however, not included as external reviewers.
Objectives


Reducing the total ischaemic time

Updating the management of ischaemic stroke with respect to:

Diagnosis

Hyperacute management

Post hyperacute care

Primary prevention

Secondary prevention
These guidelines however do not cover:

Management of cerebral haemorrhage

Stroke rehabilitation

Stroke in the paediatric aged-group population
RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT
Process
The current CPG is the initiative of the Malaysia Stroke Council of the Malaysia Society of
Neurosciences. A panel of committee members was appointed comprising of neurologists, internal
medicine physicians, geriatricians, and emergency physicians from the Ministry of Health,
universities, and private sector. Authors from the second CPG were invited to contribute on new
updates that were discussed by the panel members. The discussion started from early 2018 till 2020
before being finalised and sent to the appointed reviewers. The panel members met several times
throughout the development of the guidelines.
A review of the current medical literature on ischaemic stroke since the publication of the last CPG
on 31st Jan 2012 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic
databases – PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was conducted
from the period of previous CPG publication until 31st July 2020. The relevant MeSH terms or free
text terms were used either singly or in combination as the search strategy (refer Appendix A).
The search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans, and published in the English
language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from the retrieved list. In addition, the
reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies. Local CPGs
were also studied. Experts in the relevant field were also contacted to obtain further information.
International guidelines mainly from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association
(AHA/ASA) and the European Academy of Neurology/European Stroke Organisation (EAN/ESO)
were used as the main references.
All literature retrieved were appraised and subsequently presented for discussion during the group
meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively by members of
expert panels. Whereby the evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were agreed upon by
consensus of the panel members. The draft was then sent to local external reviewers for comments.
The level of recommendations and the grading of evidence used in this guideline was adapted from
the U.S/Canadian Preventative Services Task Force and the Guidelines for Clinical Practice
Guideline, Ministry of Health Malaysia 2003.
The principles and layout follow the methodology stated in the Guidelines for Clinical Practice
Guidelines booklet published by the Medical Development Division of the Ministry of Health Malaysia.
These guidelines have been presented to the Chairman of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA)
and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council of the Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and approval.
Formulation Of Recommendation
In formulating recommendations for the CPG, evidence from the literature i.e. systematic review,
meta-analysis, randomized controlled trial or cohort study were critically appraised using CASP
(critical appraisal skills program) checklist. Subsequently, the quality of each retrieved evidence and
its effect size were carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group.
In formulating the recommendations, the overall balances of the following aspects were considered
in determining the strength of the recommendations:
1. Overall quality of evidence
2. Balance of benefits versus harms
3. Values and preferences
4. Resource implications
5. Equity, feasibility, and acceptability
Clinical Questions Addressed:
There were several topics and subtopics that were formulated addressing the diagnosis and
management of ischaemic stroke.
1. What is the current best practice for management of acute ischaemic stroke?
2. What are the strategies in stroke prevention?
3. What are the effective non-pharmacological modification in managing patients with stroke?
For therapy, the topics and subtopics were formulated using the PICO method as follows:
P: Population- Persons with ischaemic stroke and:

Duration of stroke:

< 4.5 hours

< 6 hours

6 to 24 hours (extended hours)

More than 24 hours

Wake up stroke

Atrial Fibrillation

Older persons

Young stroke and special circumstances

Pregnancy
I: Intervention:

Reperfusion strategy:

Medical thrombolysis

Mechanical thrombectomy

Combined medical thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy

Concomitant drug therapy

Anti-platelet therapy – single or dual

Direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs)

Statins

Anti-hypertensive agents

Anti-diabetic agents
C: Comparison:

Reperfusion vs no reperfusion

Medical thrombolysis vs mechanical thrombectomy/combination therapy

Single anti-platelet therapy vs dual anti-platelet therapy

Clopidogrel vs cilostazol vs ticagrelor as a single/combination anti-platelet agent
O: Outcome:

Functional outcome at 3 months

Reduction of recurrent stroke

Reduction in major cardiovascular disease event rate (MI, heart failure, cardiovascular (CV)
death)

Reduction in all-cause mortality
Type of Question- Involves:

Therapy - Reperfusion strategy, concomitant drug therapy

Harm

Increase of bleeding risk and stroke rate

Adverse effects due to pharmacotherapy

Prognosis – Improvement of functional status, reduction of stroke recurrence or
haemorrhagic transformation and improvement in all-cause mortality
Type of Study

Systematic review and meta-analysis

Randomised controlled studies

Cohort studies
Target Group:
These guidelines are developed for all healthcare providers involved in the management of
ischaemic stroke in adults.
Target Population:
These guidelines are developed to treat all adults with ischaemic stroke.
Period of Validity of the Guidelines:
These guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with recent developments
and knowledge that is available.
Applicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:
This guideline was developed taking into account our local healthcare resources. At present medical
thrombolysis is available at some government hospitals and private healthcare centres while
mechanical thrombectomy is available likewise in limited centres. Stroke networks are being
established in its early stages in some regions in Malaysia. We hope to have a nationwide stroke
network in near future.
This guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimise the available
existing resources for the timely management of patients with ischaemic stroke.
Facilitators and Barriers:
The major barriers for the successful implementation of this CPG is the financial and
resource implications of:

transporting
these
patients
to stroke
ready
hospitals
as
soon
as
possible
using
well-equipped ambulances and accompanied by trained pre-hospital care personnel or
medical officers

availability of medical thrombolysis/mechanical thrombectomy centres providing 24/7
service

Medical thrombolysis/mechanical thrombectomy - costs of medications and thrombectomy
instruments
Implementation of the Guidelines:
The implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical governance.
To ensure successful implementation of this CPG, we suggest:

Increasing public awareness of ischaemic stroke in general and educating them on the
importance of seeking early medical attention when they developed symptoms suggestive
of stroke.

Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the importance of
timely reperfusion and appropriate management of patients with ischaemic stroke. This can
be done by roadshows, through the electronic media and in-house training sessions.

UPDATES IN MANAGEMENT OF ISCHAEMIC STROKE CPG 2020
1. New recommendations in this clinical practice guideline (CPG) refer to recommendations that
are new from the previous Management of Ischaemic Stroke CPG 2012.
2. In this current CPG, new chapters have been added to update the previous CPG. Among the
new chapters that have been added include:
a. Chapter 7: Emergency Medicine Services.
b. Chapter 12: Stroke in the Older Person
c. Chapter 16: Stroke Therapies with limited evidence.
d. Chapter 17: Quality Assurance
3. Management of Ischaemic Stroke CPG 2020, also emphasises the importance of hyperacute
care of stroke, with the previous chapter on acute treatment, being further subdivided into
three new chapters as following:
a. Chapter 8: Acute General Management
b. Chapter 9: Reperfusion of Ischaemic Brain – emphasizing on medical thrombolysis
treatment.
c. Chapter 10: Endovascular Thrombectomy
4. The following chapters have also been updated:
a. Chapter 14: Stroke in Special Circumstances – with a new subsection on the
management of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in stroke patients.
b. Chapter 15: Management of Stroke in Pregnancy.
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF STROKE CPG 2020
Chapter 1: Epidemiology, Definition and Classification Of Stroke
1.
Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and in Malaysia, stroke is the third leading cause
of mortality.
2.
Ischaemic stroke is the most common stroke, and hypertension was the most common risk factor
followed by diabetes mellitus.
3.
The new definition of stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) involved either pathological imaging
or clinical evidence of ischaemia and can be timed based on the presentation of symptoms.
4.
Ischaemic stroke can be classified according to clinical, phenotypic or aetiologic classification.
Chapter 2: Causes and Pathophysiology
1.
Three main causes of ischaemic stroke include atherothrombosis of large vessels, intracranial small
vessel disease, and embolism, which may contribute to up to 80% of the cases.
2.
Cryptogenic infarction or stroke of undetermined aetiology may be responsible for around 20 to 40%
of the cases despite extensive workout and usually would be a diagnosis of exclusion.
Chapter 3: Diagnosis and Initial Assessment
1.
The diagnosis of stroke is made by evaluating and analysing information derived from a good history,
physical examination and selected diagnostic tests.
2.
The symptoms and signs of stroke depend on the type, location, and the extent of the affected brain
tissues.
3.
A full neurological examination, including the patient’s conscious level and tests of higher mental
function is mandatory.
4.
Stroke mimics commonly confound the clinical diagnosis of stroke.
Chapter 4: Prognosis
1.
Haemorrhagic stroke has a higher mortality than ischaemic stroke.
2.
There is a decline in stroke mortality in both men and women suffering from ischaemic or
haemorrhagic stroke due to the introduction of dedicated stroke units and improved control of stroke
risk factors.
3.
The recurrence rates are 3-4% in the first month and 12% in the first year.
4.
Progress of time is an independent covariate which reflects the spontaneous recovery of bodily
functions.
Chapter 5: Prevention of Stroke
1.
Stroke is a preventable disease and may be attributed to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.
2.
Modifiable risk factors are the focus of primary prevention and can be clustered into three main
groups i.e.
a)
Lifestyle risk factors, i.e., smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating
b)
Metabolic risk factors, i.e., high systolic BP, high cholesterol, high fasting blood glucose, low
eGFR and high BMI.
c)
Environmental factors, i.e., air pollution and lead exposure.
3.
Secondary prevention of stroke involves the prevention of recurrent stroke, and this may involve
medical interventions includes antiplatelet therapy, anti-hypertensive treatment, lipid-lowering
agents, glycaemic control, prevention of cardio-embolism and re-vascularisation procedures in
selected cases.
Chapter 6: Investigations
1.
Investigations carried out for stroke are aimed to confirm the diagnosis, determine the mechanism of
stroke, stratify risk and to identify potential treatable vascular lesions.
2.
Computed tomography (CT) brain is mandatory and preferred imaging in the emergency setting to
differentiate haemorrhage from ischaemia, determine the site(s), cause, and extent of the lesion.
3.
Advance imaging may be required in selected cases in the emergency settings, e.g., ruling out stroke
mimics, reperfusion therapy in extended hours and determining potential re-vascularisation
procedure.
4.
Selected blood investigations and imaging will be required in certain patients to determine the
aetiology of stroke.
Chapter 7: Emergency Medicine Services
1.
The public should be encouraged to call 999 if they suspect a person is having a stroke.
2.
Emergency medical dispatcher and prehospital care providers should be trained to recognize and
identify stroke and are able to provide rapid transportation of suspected acute stroke patient to
nearest stroke ready hospital.
3.
Assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke in emergency department should be prioritized
in order to expediate the diagnosis of stroke and to determine the appropriate acute stroke
interventions.
4.
Audit of acute stroke care and training of emergency department personnel should be conducted to
improve quality of care in acute stroke cases.
Chapter 8: Acute General Management
1.
Acute general management in stroke includes supportive care and treatment of acute complications
in order to improve the mortality rate and functional disability.
2.
General management includes management of blood pressure, glucose control, nutritional support,
prevention of infection and DVT, and also to treat potential sequelae, e.g. raised intracranial pressure
and seizure.
Chapter 9: Reperfusion of Ischaemic Brain
1.
Intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose of 90mg) is recommended for the definite onset
stroke for up to 4.5 hours from the onset. The treatment window can also be extended via CT
perfusion with clinical evidence of penumbra-core mismatch up to 9 hours from the time of the last
known to be well/midpoint of sleep or via MRI (DWI-FLAIR mismatch) done to identify possible stroke
onset within the last 4.5 hours.
2.
Intravenous tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg;maximum dose of 25mg) is a possible treatment agent in
acute stroke that presented within 4.5 hours with evidence of large vessel occlusion on imaging.
Chapter 10:
Endovascular Thrombectomy
1.
Hyperacute endovascular thrombectomy is recommended for the definite onset of stroke with
evidence of large vessel occlusion which is within 6 hours from the onset. The treatment window can
be extended via CT/MR perfusion (penumbra-core mismatch) or MRI (clinical-imaging mismatch)
with current evidence showed significant benefit up to 24 hours from the onset/time of last known to
be well. However, treatment pathway should not be delayed, as the treatment outcome can be
influence by the imaging-to-recanalization time.
2.
Drip & Ship (IVT prior to EVT) as per Chapter 9 is recommended for eligible patients.
Chapter 11: Stroke Unit
1.
The use of comprehensive specialized stroke care centres (stroke units) that incorporates
rehabilitation services are able to reduce mortality and disabilities among stroke patients.
Chapter 12: Stroke in The Older Person
1.
All older persons with acute stroke should be assessed for fitness/frailty level using a validated
instrument to facilitate a tailored and individualised treatment plan.
2.
An older person can benefit from acute treatment for stroke including stroke thrombolysis and
endovascular thrombectomy, providing the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the treatment are met.
3.
An older person can benefit from and should receive treatment for stroke prevention with
management of polypharmacy issues, individualised medication dosages and treatment targets as is
tolerated, for stroke risk factors.
4.
All older persons with stroke should be:
-
screened for delirium using a validated tool, and receive a tailored multicomponent intervention
and management plan for delirium, when admitted with an acute stroke
-
offered falls and fragility fracture risk assessment and management during the
rehabilitation period
-
assessed by a multidisciplinary team with an appropriate discharge plan
-
able to receive end-of-life care and recommendations when the prognosis is poor
either from the stroke itself, complications, or other serious comorbid conditions
Chapter 13: Stroke and Cardioembolism
1.
Cardioemboli is a common cause of stroke. Stroke patient must have cardiac assessment to look for
the presence of cardioemboli.
2.
It causes more severe stroke and
carry a higher morbidity and mortality rates.
3.
Effective treatment to prevent cardioembolism is available and should be offered to patients at risk.
4.
NOAC is preferred over VKA for NVAF.
5.
Patient on VKA should have regular INR monitoring and aimed for time in therapeutic range (TTR) >
70%.
6.
Antiplatelet is not recommended in NVAF for the prevention of stroke.
Chapter 14: Stroke in Special Circumstances
1.
Young onset stroke requires more comprehensive investigation to determine the stroke
aetiology.
2.
Diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undertermined source (ESUS) is made
after standard evaluation to rule out possible cause of stroke.
3.
Further specialized investigations needed in the cryptogenic or ESUS stroke for example
prolonged Holter monitoring to look for atrial fibrillation or to look for evidence of patent foramen
ovale (PFO).
4.
Cerebral venous thrombosis is one of the major cause of venous infarct and would require
investigations to determine the cause of thrombosis. Treatment mainly directed at
anticoagulation with adjunctive therapy to prevent associated complications.
Chapter 15: Management of Stroke in Pregnancy
1.
MRI of the brain (without gadolinium contrast) is the radiological modality of choice for investigating
strokes in pregnancy.
2.
Aspirin is the only choice of antiplatelet for pregnant patients with a well-defined low risk profile.
Chapter 16: Stroke Therapies with Limited Evidence
1.
There are a variety of stroke medications and treatment modalities, but the evidence is very limited.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF STROKE
1.1 Epidemiology of Stroke
Stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability in many countries, including Malaysia. Global
stroke estimates study reported that, in 2013, there were approximately 25.7 million stroke survivors,
6.5 million deaths, 113 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and 10.3 million new cases
of stroke.1 The high burden of stroke was mainly observed in developing countries, and accounted
for 75.2% of all stroke-related deaths and 81% of associated DALYs lost.
Statistics from the Department of Statistics, Malaysia showed that stroke emerged as one of the top
five leading causes of mortality since 2000. Data in 2017 showed that cerebrovascular diseases
contributed to 7.1% of all mortalities recorded in the Malaysian population (Table 1.1).
Table 1.1: Leading Causes of Mortalities in Malaysia

2.
Pneumonia

3.
Stroke
7.1%
4.
Transport Accidents

5.
Malignant Cancer
2.3%
(Source: Department of Statistics Malaysia, 2017)
Ischaemic stroke accounted for 79.4% of all stroke cases, followed by haemorrhagic stroke (18.2%),
transient ischaemic attack (2%) and unclassified stroke (0.4%).2
Hypertension was the most common risk factor (72%), followed by diabetes mellitus (47%),
dyslipidaemia (32%) and smoking (31%).3 Hypertension remains the most common medical risk
factor for stroke, whereas current smoking and physical inactivity are the most predominant
lifestyle-related risk factors. In general, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and tobacco smoking tend to
be more prevalent among men, whereas hypercholesterolaemia, physical inactivity and obesity were
more prevalent among women.4
The mean age for ischaemic stroke in Malaysia was 62.8 years for the first stroke and 64.3 years for
recurrent cases.2 Malaysian women with a first-ever ischaemic stroke had a greater severity, higher
number of risk factors and poorer functional outcomes, as compared to men. After post gender–age
adjustment, the Malaysian population observed an increased incidence of stroke in women as
compared to men. However, there was no difference between genders in terms of access to
thrombolysis treatment.5
1.2 Conceptual Definitions
1.2.1
Stroke
Stroke is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by rapidly developing clinical symptoms
and/or signs of focal, and at times global, loss of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting more than
24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of a vascular origin.
The new definition of central nervous system (CNS) infarction which incorporates scientific and
technological advances is “brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischaemia, based on
either pathological imaging or other objective evidence of cerebrospinal cord or retinal ischaemic
injury in a defined vascular distribution, or clinical evidence of ischaemic injury, based on symptoms
persisting for greater than 24 hours.” 6
Strokes may be classified and timed as: 7
I.
Early hyperacute (a stroke that is 0–6 hours old)
II.
Late hyperacute (6–24 hours)
III.
Acute (24 hours to 7 days)
IV. Subacute (1–3 weeks)
V.
Chronic (more than 3 weeks)
1.2.2
Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)
TIA originally had a time-based definition characterized by an acute loss of focal cerebral or
monocular functions with symptoms lasting less than 24 hours and which is thought to be due to
inadequate cerebral and ocular blood supply as a result of arterial thrombosis or embolism. However,
a time-based definition is inadequate because there is risk of permanent tissue injury (i.e. infarction)
even when focal transient neurologic symptoms last less than one hour.
TIA currently uses a tissue-based definition i.e. a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused
by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischaemia, without acute infarction.8
1.3 Classification of Stroke
1.3.1
Why Classify Stroke?
Stroke classification has numerous implications during the immediate supportive care and
rehabilitation, for prognostic purposes, guiding cost-effective investigations for underlying causes as
well as to aid decisions for therapy and secondary stroke prevention strategies. Apart from being
useful in setting up stroke registries and data banks for epidemiological studies, proper classification
of the causative mechanism of stroke is important for optimizing stroke treatment and prognosis.
1.3.2
What are Stroke Classification Systems that are Widely Used Nowadays?
Ischaemic stroke classification can be categorized into:
I.
Clinical / Syndromic Classification
II.
Phenotypic Classification
III. Aetiologic / Causative Classification
1.3.3
What Other Common Classification Systems are Being Used?
There are a few other classification systems currently being used worldwide which have its own
advantages and disadvantages:
I.
The Oxford Community Stroke Project (OCSP) which was developed based on clinical
findings especially neurological symptoms.9
II.
The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) which is a valid straightforward
and is currently the most widely used classification system based on stroke mechanism. This
classification system is further subclassified to Stop-Stroke Study TOAST (SSS-TOAST) which
is more specific using algorithms.10
III.
The Causative Classification Systems (CCS) is a web-based system which uses multiple
sources of clinical data and is highly dependent on the availability of modern diagnostic
technology.11
IV. ASCO is the first purely phenotypic classification in which every patient is characterized by
A-S-C-O acronym: Atherosclerosis, Small-vessel disease, Cardiac source, and Other
causes. ASCOD Phenotyping of Ischaemic Stroke is the modified version of the ASCO
classification.12
V.
Chinese Ischaemic Stroke Classification (CISS) is a new two-step system that looks at the
aetiology and underlying mechanism of stroke. It takes into account the importance of
intracranial atheromatous branch disease affecting penetrating arteries and the underlying
mechanisms of ischaemic strokes caused by large artery atherosclerosis, that commonly found
in the Asian population.13
Key Recommendations:
1. Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and in Malaysia, stroke is the third leading
cause of mortality.
2. Ischaemic stroke is the most common stroke, and hypertension is the most common risk
factor followed by diabetes mellitus.
3. The new definition of stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) involved either pathological
imaging or clinical evidence of ischaemia and can be timed based on the presentation of
symptoms.
4. Ischaemic stroke can be classified according to clinical, phenotypic, or aetiologic
classification.
CAUSES AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
2.1 Principal Causes of Ischaemic Stroke
The three main causes of ischaemic stroke are:1
I.
Atherothrombosis of large vessels (20-50%)
II.
Intracranial small vessel disease (25%)
III.
Embolism (20%)
2.1.1
Atherothrombosis
Atherothrombosis is defined as atherosclerosis with superimposed thrombosis.2 Atherosclerosis
affects large and medium-sized arteries. The process begins in childhood as fatty streaks and
progresses over years with gradual build-up of fibrolipid plaque and infiltration of inflammatory cells.
Thrombosis occurs when this atherosclerotic plaque is disrupted resulting in platelet aggregation.
Atherothrombosis leads to local arterial occlusion with intraluminal propagation of the thrombus
proximally or distally or it can result in distal embolism. Intracranial large artery disease is the main
cause of ischaemic stroke among South Asian patients.3
2.1.2
Intracranial Small Vessel Disease
Intracranial small vessel disease is thought to be due to lipohyalinosis, microatheroma and fibrinoid
necrosis.4 The clinical syndrome caused by this phenomenon is lacunar infarction due to occlusion of
small perforating arteries. Table (2.1) exhibits the vascular risk factors associated with increased risk
of stroke.5-7

2.1.3
Embolism
Cardioembolism causes approximately 20% of all ischaemic strokes.8 Embolic material formed within
the heart or large arteries travels through the arterial system, lodging in a vessel and partially or
completely occluding it. The most common causes are atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease.
Rare causes of embolism include air, fat, cholesterol, bacteria, and tumour tissues.9
2.2 Other Causes
Other causes include non-atherosclerotic abnormalities of the cerebral vasculature such as arterial
dissection,
fibromuscular
dysplasia,
vasculitis,
Moyamoya
disease,
hypercoagulable
states,
metabolic disorders, and inherited conditions such as Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy
with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
2.3 Cryptogenic Infarctions
Cryptogenic infarctions or stroke of undetermined aetiology are infarctions without a defined cause
despite a complete work up and account for 20-40% of all ischaemic stroke. Possible mechanisms of
cryptogenic stroke are embolism secondary to occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,10 paradoxical
embolism originating from the systemic venous circulation that enters the arterial circulation through
a patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or pulmonary
arteriovenous malformation and sub-stenotic (<50% stenosis) atherosclerotic disease. A new
terminology for non-lacunar cryptogenic stroke without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic
sources is Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS).11 Cryptogenic stroke is a diagnosis of
exclusion.
The algorithm as shown below outlines the pathophysiology of ischaemic stroke and the various
causes.
Key Recommendations:
1.
Three main causes of ischaemic stroke include atherothrombosis of large vessels, intracranial
small vessel disease, and embolism which may contribute up to 80% of the cases.
2.
Cryptogenic infarction or stroke of undetermined aetiology may be responsible for around 20 to
40% of the cases despite an extensive workout and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.
DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT
3.1 General Aim
In general, the diagnosis of stroke is made by evaluating and analysing information derived from a
good history and physical examination and is supplemented with selected diagnostic tests. Due to
the nature of the illness and the dramatic manner in which the neurological deficit occurs, history is of
utmost importance. Every effort must be made to obtain information from the patient, family members,
friends, and witnesses.
The diagnosis should provide answers to the following questions:
I.
What is the neurological deficit?
II.
Where is the lesion(s)?
III.
What is the lesion?
IV. Why has the lesion occurred?
V.
What are the potential complications and prognosis?
3.2 Symptoms and Signs
The symptoms and signs of stroke depend on the type, location, and the extent of the affected brain
tissue. Stroke patients usually have a sudden or rapid onset of focal neurological symptoms, within
minutes to an hour. Some patients may, however, have a stepwise or gradual worsening or waxing
and waning of symptoms. A third of all strokes occur during sleep at night, therefore, the weakness is
first recognized on waking up in the morning. Diagnosing stroke in the initial hours is very difficult,
particularly when the onset is uncertain, the features are atypical or evolving, the patient is unwell or
agitated, or when access to imaging is delayed, or when brain imaging is normal.1
A full neurological examination, including documenting the patient’s conscious level and tests of
higher mental function (such as the mini-mental state examination) is mandatory. Every positive and
negative finding should point to the site of lesion. These can be divided into 2 broad groups: a)
clinical features that are caused by anterior circulation stroke (carotid artery); and b) those caused by
posterior circulation stroke (vertebrobasilar system) (see Table 3.1).


Hemiparesis or hemisensory loss contralateral to the cranial nerves palsy

Cerebellar signs
Less commonly, some patients present with atypical stroke symptoms (stroke “chameleons”) that
can imitate other neurological diseases.2 This is because the symptoms:
I.
are not anatomically localising (such as neuropsychiatric symptoms, confusion and/or altered
consciousness),
II.
are positive (such as abnormal involuntary movements, rather than paralysis, due to an epileptic
seizure, alien hand syndrome, isolated hemifacial spasms or hemiballismus),
III.
seems to be peripheral nerve in origin [vestibular syndrome, other cranial nerve palsy (especially
third and seventh cranial nerve palsy), cortical hand syndrome, acute monoparesis], and
IV. are isolated (isolated vertigo, binocular blindness, amnesia, headache, anosognosia, dysarthria,
dysphagia, stridor, or foreign accent syndrome).2-4 These atypical presentations are more likely
to be due to a stroke if the patient has a known cardiovascular disease or risk factors.2
3.3 Differential Diagnoses
Stroke mimics commonly confound the clinical diagnosis of stroke (Table 3.2). In one study, 19% of
patients diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke by neurologists before cranial CT scanning actually
had non-cerebrovascular causes for their clinical presentations.5
Table 3.2: Differential Diagnosis of Stroke1,2,6,7

Metabolic / toxic encephalopathy (hypoglycaemia, non-ketotic, hyperglycaemia, hyponatraemia,
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or drug intoxication)

Epileptic seizures (postictal Todd’s paresis)

Hemiplegic migraine

Structural intracranial lesions (e.g. subdural haematoma, brain tumour or arteriovenous
malformation)

Brain infections e.g. encephalitis (e.g. herpes simplex virus), brain abscess or
tuberculoma



Myelopathies (e.g. spinal stenosis, cervical myelopathy, etc.)



Peripheral vestibulopathy (e.g. positional vertigo, labyrinthine disorder, etc.)
Key Recommendations:
1.
The diagnosis of stroke is made by evaluating and analysing information derived from a good
history, physical examination and selected diagnostic tests.
2.
The symptoms and signs of stroke depend on the type, location, and the extent of the affected
brain tissues.
3.
A full neurological examination, including assessing the patient’s conscious level and tests of
higher mental function is mandatory.
4.
Stroke mimics commonly confound the clinical diagnosis of stroke.
PROGNOSIS
Prognosis of stroke depends on the type of stroke, size, and location of the lesion. Haemorrhagic
stroke has a higher mortality than ischaemic stroke.1-4 However, patients with haemorrhagic stroke
show a better neurological and functional recovery.5 Brainstem infarction, large hemispheric
infarction and cardioembolic stroke also carry a poor prognosis.6 Lacunar infarct has the lowest
mortality rate.7
4.1 Survival after Stroke
There is a decline in stroke mortality in both men and women suffering from ischaemic or
haemorrhagic stroke across all ages in many countries over the last few decades.8,9 This can be
attributed to the introduction of stroke units which provide organized stroke care and better control of
stroke risk factors, resulting in milder strokes.10-15
A patient who survives the first 30 days after a first-ever stroke has an annual death risk of
9-10%.16,17 Studies in recent years showed that case fatality rates after a first-ever stroke (all types
combined) were 10% at one week, 14-20% at one month, 27-30% at one year, 47-60% at 5 years16,17
and 76% at 10 years.18,19 In a population study, more than 70% of patients either died or were
disabled at 5 years after the index stroke.19 Age (<75 years), verbal component of the Glasgow
Coma Scale (orientated), arm power, ability to walk and pre-stroke dependency (Barthel Index ≥12
out of 20) are the 5 variables that have been shown to predict independent survival at 3 months and
12 months after stroke.20
In a local study published in 2003, the in-hospital mortality in ischaemic stroke was 11% while for
haemorrhagic stroke, it was much higher, at 27.3%.21
Death occurring within the first 30 days after stroke is commonly due to the direct effect of brain
damage.4 There-after, mortality is usually caused by complications of immobilisation (e.g.
bronchopneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, etc.), recurrent stroke and coronary heart disease.16
4.2 Risk Factors for Stroke Mortality
Previous use of antiplatelet drugs nearly halves the risk of early deaths in patients with ischaemic
stroke, while old age, atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus increases the
risk of early deaths.6 Diabetes mellitus, both diastolic and systolic hypertension, smoking, increased
cardiothoracic ratio and pre-existing coronary heart disease are risk factors for long-term stroke
mortality.22
4.3 Recurrent Stroke
The recurrent rates are 3-4% in the first month and 12% in the first year. Thereafter the risk falls to
about 4-5% per year and by 5 years, around 26.4-30% of patients will suffer a recurrent stroke.23-26
Up to 40% of patients will have a recurrent event at 10 years.25
The risk is higher among individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, symptomatic atherosclerotic
disease, an active source of thrombosis, or who have discontinued their antiplatelet and
antihypertensive therapies.27
4.4 Disability
Progress of time is an independent covariate which reflects spontaneous recovery of bodily functions.
About 16-42% of improvements can be seen during the first 6 to 10 weeks of stroke onset.28
Following a first-ever stroke, around 60% of patients may survive up to 5 years.18 One-third of stroke
survivors may exhibit some form of persistent disability after the initial episode of stroke. Up to 58%
of patients who survive the first stroke will regain independence in activities of daily living (ADL), with
most functional recovery occurring within the first 2 months of stroke. Less functional recovery is
observed at the subsequent 4 to 5 months after stroke. Improvement in functional recovery is less
than certain after 6 months, however the known predictors of disability were older age, very low
premorbid level of activities before stroke and subsequent recurrent stroke.29 Over a period of 10
years of follow-up, almost one half of survivors remained disabled, and one seventh required
institutional care.26
Key Recommendations:
1.
Haemorrhagic stroke has a higher mortality than ischaemic stroke.
2.
There is a decline in stroke mortality in both men and women suffering from ischaemic or
haemorrhagic stroke due to the introduction of stroke units and better control of stroke risk
factors.
3.
The recurrent rates are 3-4% in the first month and 12% in the first year.
4.
Progress of time is an independent covariate which reflects spontaneous recovery of bodily
functions.
PREVENTION OF STROKE
5.1 Primary Prevention
5.1.1
Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Stroke in Malaysia
Stroke incidence and prevalence in Malaysia has increased steadily over the last 2 decades. Stroke
is the third cause of mortality and the second leading cause of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY)
in Malaysia.1 The incidence and prevalence rate for both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke in
Malaysia had increased steadily from 2010 to 2014.2 Without effective interventions, stroke incidence
will continue to rise, thus increasing the healthcare burden.2
Data from the National Stroke Registry showed that first ever strokes contributed to about 79.2% of
all stroke cases in Malaysia, while 20.8% were due to recurrent strokes.2 Therefore, primary
prevention is the key to any national strategy to reduce the burden of stroke. Top modifiable risk
factors associated with first ever strokes among Malaysians were hypertension (69.9%), diabetes
mellitus (41.4%), smoking (26.3%), hyperlipidaemia (24.4%), family history of stroke (5.8%),
ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and atrial fibrillation (3.4%). However, geographical and gender
differences are observed.2 Hypertension and diabetes were significantly higher in women compared
to men, while smoking and IHD were higher in men. Within Peninsular Malaysia, the East Coast had
the highest number of hypertensive patients, while the Southern regions had the highest number of
patients with diabetes. East Malaysia reported the highest number of smokers.3
The INTERSTROKE study, which involved 32 countries including Malaysia, identified ten modifiable
risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, waist-hip-ratio, poor diet, smoking, alcohol,
cardiac cause, apo-lipoprotein levels and psychosocial factors) which accounted for 90% of
population-adjustable risk (PAR) of stroke.4 The Global Burden of Diseases 2013 study identified
three clusters of modifiable risk factors associated with highest stroke burden in LMIC5:
I.
Lifestyle risk factors – smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating (74.1%)
II.
Metabolic risk factors – high systolic BP, high cholesterol, high fasting blood glucose, low eGFR
and high BMI (72%)
III.
Environmental - air pollution and lead exposure (33.9%)
The National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2011 and 2015 highlighted an alarming trend in the
prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among Malaysians, with 63% of Malaysian adults (>18
years) having at least one CV risk factor (overweight/obesity, high blood pressure, high blood
glucose and high blood cholesterol).6,7 Based on NHMS 2015, the prevalence for the three major CV
risk factors among Malaysian adults were7:

Hypertension (known and undiagnosed) – 30.3%

Diabetes mellitus (known and undiagnosed) - 17.5%

Hypercholesterolaemia (known and undiagnosed) – 47.7%
5.2 Modifiable and Non-modifiable Risk Factors
5.2.1
Non-modifiable Risk Factors
Understanding the epidemiology of risk factors for stroke among Malaysians allows prioritization of
primary prevention strategies specific to the needs of the population. Stroke risk factors can be
categorized into modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Non-modifiable risk factors include age,
sex, and family history.
Age: The cumulative effect of aging on the cardiovascular system and the progressive nature of
stroke risk factors over a prolonged period of time substantially increase stroke risk. The risk of
stroke doubles in each successive decade after 55 years of age.8,9
Sex: Stroke is more prevalent in men than women.8 Overall, men have higher age-specific stroke
incidence rates compared to women.10 Exceptions are in the 35 to 44 year-olds and in those over 85
years of age, of whom women have slightly greater age-specific incidence than men.10
Circumstances such as oral contraceptive use and pregnancy uniquely contributes to the risk of
stroke in women.11-13
Family History: Both paternal and maternal history of stroke may be associated with an increased
risk. This may be mediated through genetic and shared environmental factors.14,15 Patients with a
strong family
history of recurrent subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy should be
investigated for CADASIL, Fabry’s disease or mitochondrial diseases.
(New recommendation)
5.2.2
Modifiable Risk Factors
The National Stroke Registry has identified the following as the top modifiable risk factors for the
first-ever stroke among Malaysians2:

Hypertension

Diabetes mellitus

Hypercholesterolaemia

Smoking

IHD

Atrial fibrillation
5.3 Risk Stratification and Monitoring
5.3.1
Cardiovascular Risk Estimates
For primary prevention strategies to be effective, understanding risk estimates is crucial for both the
population at large and healthcare providers. Individualized risk estimation scores that takes into
account both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, validated across multi populations such as
the Framingham Stroke Risk Score Calculator, ASCVD and QRISK2 is helpful to create awareness
and stratifying individuals according to cardiovascular risk categories.16,17 The Revised FSRS is
shown to be better than the conventional FRS as it adjusts for temporal trends in stroke risk factors
and has better discriminatory index for detecting stroke in various populations.18 These risk
estimations allow stratifying of individuals into risk categories for better preventive strategies.
The 2017 Malaysian Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Clinical Practice
Guideline (CPG) has advocated the use of FRS to stratify individuals into low risk, intermediate, high
and very high risk based on their 10-year risks of developing cardiovascular events.19

Low risk - FRS- CVD risk <10%

Intermediate risk – FRS -CVD 10-20%

High risk - FRS- CVD >20%

Very high risk - FRS- CVD >30%
Patients with low risk should be counselled to maintain their status of health and to have regular
reviews, while those with intermediate to high risks should be followed-up, and maintained on
lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy for their specific risk factors, e.g. treatment of
hypertension, LDL-C, smoking cessation, effective diabetes control, and encouraging physical
activity and healthy eating.19
(Level II, Grade B)
5.3.2
Stroke Risk Estimates
The Stroke Riskometer App, a smart phone-based application available in various languages
(including the Malay language) allows for individualized stroke risk calculation, using 20 modifiable
and non-modifiable risk factors. It contains educational videos for self-management of risk factors.20
The app calculates individualized 5- and 10-year risks of stroke and is an effective tool for monitoring
risk reductions associated with lifestyle and medical interventions. The Malay version has been
validated for language and content (unpublished data).21 Two interventional studies using Stroke
Riskometer as a tool to reduce stroke risk have been completed among Malaysians with high risk
(diabetics and stroke carers), with positive outcomes.22,23
The use of Stroke Riskometer and R-FRS Calculator may be beneficial in the community and in
clinics for individualizing stroke risk and its management.20
(Level II, Grade B)
5.4 Prevention and Management of Risk Factors
5.4.1
Lifestyle Changes
The US Health Professionals and Nurses study showed that participants who achieved all five
healthy lifestyle choices (not smoking, moderate intake of alcohol, BMI <25 kg/m2 , daily exercise for
30 minutes and a healthy diet score in the top 40%), had their incidence of stroke reduced by 80% as
compared to those who achieved none.24
A study among 11450 Swedish men with high cardiovascular risk (hypertensive, high cholesterol,
diabetes, heart failure or atrial fibrillation) showed that adopting all five healthy lifestyle choices [(≥5
servings of fruits and vegetables and <30g/day of processed meat; not smoking; ≥150min of physical
activity /week; BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2; low to moderate alcohol consumption (>0 to <30g/day)] had a
72% reduction of stroke incidence over 9 years as compared to those who were adherent to none or
only one healthy behaviour.25
Recommendation: Adopting a healthy lifestyle (diets rich in fruits and vegetables, no smoking, daily
exercise of >30 minutes or 150 minutes/week, low to moderate alcohol intake and maintaining a
normal BMI of 18.5-25 kg/m2) reduces stroke incidence in normal and high-risk populations.24,25
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
5.4.2
Hypertension
Hypertension is the commonest and major risk factor for both ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes in
Malaysia, affecting 69.9% of patients with the first ever stroke.2 The incidence of stroke increases in
proportion to both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Isolated systolic hypertension is an
important risk factor for stroke in the elderly (systolic blood pressure >140mmHg and diastolic blood
pressure <90mmHg).26
Population specific and individualized strategies should be conducted to prevent the development of
hypertension. Adopting healthy lifestyle such as smoking cessation, Dietary Action to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) diet, increased physical activity and reducing salt consumption are shown to
reduce the risk of developing hypertension.27
(Level I, Grade A)
5.4.2.1 Primary Stroke Prevention in Specific High-risk Group with Hypertension
The ACCORD BP trial showed that a lower target systolic value of 120 mmHg was superior to a
target value of 140 mmHg in preventing any stroke and non-fatal stroke in diabetics, as secondary
endpoint, but did not prevent other cardiovascular events.28 The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure
Intervention Trial) study showed that intensive BP lowering regime to a target of ≤120 mmHg in
high-risk non-diabetic hypertensive patients aged 50 years or older led to a reduction in all
cardiovascular events and mortality but with an excess of adverse events in the intensive group.29
However, there was no significant reduction in stroke event in these patients compared to the
non-intensive group.
Large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that reduction in blood
pressure reduces first ever and recurrent stroke by 40%.30,31
(Level I)
Lowering the systolic blood pressure by 10mmHg is associated with a reduction in risk of stroke by
about a third, irrespective of baseline blood pressure levels.31
(Level I)
For diabetics with hypertension, lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 120 mmHg or below
with careful monitoring of adverse events led to a significant reduction in stroke incidence.26
Recommendation: Target BP for diabetics is <130mmHg systolic and <80mmHg diastolic,
preferably <120mmHg if tolerated.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
For high-risk non-diabetic hypertensive patients, intensive systolic BP lowering to below 120mmHg
led to excess adverse events without reduction in stroke incidence.27
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade B)
Recommendation: Newly diagnosed hypertension in the very elderly (>80 years of age) should be
treated.32
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade B)
5.4.3
Smoking
The Malaysian National Stroke Registry data showed that 51% of all patients with the first ever stroke
were smokers. All forms of smoking, both active and passive, are a major risk factor for stroke.2
Smokers who stopped for more than 5 years have the same risk as non-smokers.33
(Level III)
Recommendation: Cessation of smoking is strongly recommended.
(Level III, Grade C)
5.4.3.1 Smoking And Non Communicable Diseases
Smoking of tobacco and tobacco products (cigarette, electronic cigarette/vape, shisha, pipe, cigar
etc.) can lead to various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Worldwide, more than eight million
people die every year because of this habit (WHO Tobacco Fact Sheet, 2020).
Hence, the decision to integrate smoking treatment with NCDs is important to reduce the prevalence
of NCDs and their complications. This decision was made during the World Health Organization
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) Steering Committee Meeting in December
2019 chaired by the Honourable Health Minister of Malaysia.
The treatment for smoking should be initiated by the treating doctor based on the assessment and
treatment of tobacco use disorder as in Table 1. Details on this can be found in the CPG on
Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder 2016, available at:
https://www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/Penerbitan/CPG/Respiratory/CPG_TobacoDisorder.pdf
Table 5.1: Assessment and treatment of tobacco use disorder
ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT
1.
Ask and document smoking status for all patients.
2.
Provide brief advice on quit smoking at every visit to all smokers.
3.
Assess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence
Questionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using carbon monoxide (CO)
breath analyser (IF AVAILABLE).
4.
Offer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless contraindicated.
5.
If selected, use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for at least eight to twelve weeks,
whereas varenicline should be used for at least twelve weeks.
6.
Combination therapy (e.g. two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g. bupropion with an NRT) is better than
monotherapy in smoking cessation treatment and may be most useful for those smokers at
highest risk of relapse.
7.
Use smoking cessation medications with caution in special populations (e.g. children and
adolescents, pregnant, breastfeeding women, psychiatric and substance abuse disorder
patients).
8.
Arrange a minimum of six to eight face to face follow-up sessions for smoking cessation
interventions in six months through counselling support team (health education officer,
pharmacists or any officer trained for quit smoking services).
5.4.4
Alcohol
Alcohol consumption has been identified as one of the risk factors for global stroke burden.33 Heavy
alcohol drinking, of more than 4 units/day (1unit = 1glass wine = 1 pack of hard liquor), increases the
risk of stroke.
Recommendation: Avoid heavy alcohol consumption or limit to < 1 drink per day.
(New recommendation, Level II-2, Grade B)
5.4.5
Post-menopausal Hormone Replacement Therapy
Stroke rates rapidly rise in women once they become menopausal. The Nurses’ Health Study (6-year
follow-up of 59,337 postmenopausal women) showed only a weak association between stroke and
oestrogen replacement therapy. However, the Women’s Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin
Study (E+P Study) showed a 31% increase in the risk of stroke due to E+ P.34
Recommendation: Post-menopausal hormonal therapy may increase the risk of stroke and is not
recommended for primary stroke prevention.
(Level II, Grade B)
5.4.6
Diabetes
Case-control studies of stroke patients and prospective epidemiological studies have confirmed an
independent effect of diabetes on ischaemic stroke, with an increased relative risk in diabetics
ranging from 1.8- to nearly 6-folds.35
(Level II-2)
Recommendation: Tight control of hypertension in diabetics is recommended to reduce stroke
incidence.27
(Level I, Grade A)
A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort and nested case-control cohort
studies showed that compared to controls with a normal HbA1c range (i.e. <5.7%), patients with
diabetes mellitus with an abnormal HbA1c range (i.e. ≥6.5%) had an increased risk of first-ever
stroke with an average HR [] of 2.15 [95% CI 1.76, 2.63].In those with a pre–diabetes mellitus HbA1c
range (i.e. 5.7– 6.5%) there was not increased risk of first-ever stroke (average HR 1.19 ,95% CI
0.87, 1.62). 36
Recommendation: More intensive glycaemic control targets (HbA1c <6.5%) may be required for
optimal ischemic stroke prevention.
(Level I, Grade A)
5.4.7
Hyperlipidaemia
Although the relationship between high cholesterol and increased risk of coronary heart disease is
stronger, epidemiological studies have also shown an association between raised serum lipids and
risk of ischaemic stroke.37,38
The MRC/BHF, a RCT involving 20,536 high risk individuals showed that statin therapy significantly
reduced the incidence of fatal and non-fatal strokes by 28%.39 A meta-analysis of trials on statin
therapy versus control in individuals with a 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10%,
showed that each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol levels produced an absolute reduction in
major vascular events of about 11 per 1000 over 5 years.40
The HOPE-3 trial studied 12,705 patients with intermediate risk and used fixed-dose BP lowering
(Candersartan and HCTZ), cholesterol lowering (Rosuvastain) or combination treatment regime. It
was found that a low-dose Rosuvastatin therapy and combination treatment reduced stroke
incidence by 30% and 44%, respectively.41
A prospective study involving 7484 elderly population (>65 years) with no history of vascular events
showed that the use of statins or fibrates reduced stroke incidence by 30%.42
In the high-risk group (those with cardiovascular disease, occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes),
statin therapy is recommended to reduce the incidence of coronary events and ischaemic strokes,
even amongst individuals with normal cholesterol concentrations.39
(Level I, Grade A)
In the high-risk group, intensive lipid lowering therapy is superior in reducing stroke as compared to
normal therapy.39
(New recommendation, Level I)
Low dose statin is beneficial in reducing stroke risk in patients with low and intermediate risk.41,42
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
Low dose statin is beneficial in reducing stroke risk in elderly patients with no vascular events.42
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
5.4.8
Dietary Factors
The PREDIMED study showed that a Mediterranean diet enriched with either olive oil or mixed nuts,
reduced the incidence of stroke by 47% in 5 years as compared to a low fat diet.43 A meta-analysis
involving 20 prospective studies showed that diet rich in fruits and vegetables reduced stroke
incidence with a linear inverse relationship between fruits and vegetables consumption and stroke
incidence.44
Recommendation: A Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil and canola oil, with less meat and
increased vegetables is beneficial for stroke prevention.43
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
Recommendation: A diet rich in fruits (citrus type) and vegetables (green leafy) is beneficial in
reducing stroke.44
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
Recommendation: DASH diet that is high in vegetables and fruits and low in saturated fats is
beneficial in reducing BP.45
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
5.4.9
Physical Activity
Physical activity is defined as any bodily movements involving skeletal muscles that results in energy
expenditure and may involve occupational and leisure time activities such as walking, commuting
and housework. However, meta-analyses of observational studies on physical activity and stroke
showed that increased physical activity in healthy adults reduced stroke incidence by 20-25%46 and
stroke mortality by 17% irrespective of gender.47 Analysis from the Japanese Diabetes Complications
study showed that increased physical activity (30 minutes of walking daily) reduced stroke incidence
in diabetics by 45%.48
Recommendation: Increased physical activity is recommended for stroke prevention in healthy
adults and high-risk patients.46-48

Medical Therapy
5.4.10.1 Aspirin
The ARRIVE trial which involved 12500 participants with moderate cardiovascular risk and low risk of
bleeding, showed that Aspirin did not prevent the first occurrence of cardiovascular events and
stroke as compared to placebo.49
Similarly, the Japanese Primary Prevention Project, a randomized controlled trial which involved
elderly patients (60-85 years of age) with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia did not show
the net benefit of Aspirin in stroke prevention. There were concerns that Aspirin use may lead to
increased incidence of intracranial bleeding in Asian patients.50
The ASCEND Aspirin study, a RCT which involved 15480 diabetic patients did not show a net benefit
of Aspirin in preventing stroke or cardiovascular events, but with an increased risk of bleeding.51
Recommendation: Daily Aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention of stroke in diabetics,
moderate risk individuals or elderly patients in view of the high risk of bleeding which outweighs any
benefits.49-51

5.5 Secondary Prevention of Stroke
Secondary prevention strategies are aimed at preventing recurrent stroke. This should be tailored
according to the individual’s stroke pathogenesis based on neuroimaging and investigations (see
Investigations).
The risk for recurrent vascular events after stroke or transient ischaemic attack is approximately 5%
per year for stroke, 3% per year for myocardial infarction and 7% per year for any one of stroke,
myocardial infarction or vascular death.52 This figure is even higher in certain populations, especially
in those with high cerebrovascular atherosclerotic burden and for patients with ipsilateral high grade
(70%) extracranial carotid stenosis.53
5.5.1
Anti-platelet Therapy
Aspirin: There is substantial evidence to support the use of Aspirin. A 25% risk reduction of stroke
was seen in all patients with stroke who received Aspirin.54 Aspirin given within 48 hours had shown
to be beneficial in reducing recurrent stroke and deaths.54-56 Studies comparing the effects of
different dosages of Aspirin had failed to show any differences in stroke recurrences.57-60
Recommendation: The recommended dose of oral Aspirin post-stroke is 75mg to 325mg daily.
(Level I, Grade A)
Alternative anti-platelet medications can be considered for patients with Aspirin allergy, Aspirin
failure, Aspirin intolerance or Aspirin contraindications based on the evidence presented below.
Ticlopidine: Previous clinical trials demonstrated that Ticlopidine is slightly superior to Aspirin.61,62
Full blood count monitoring is essential as neutropenia is the most important side-effect.61 Severe
neutropenia usually occurs within the first 3 months of use. Thus, a baseline full blood count should
be performed every 2-3 weeks during this time frame. Ticlopidine can also be used if the patient has
recurrent symptoms despite Aspirin administration.
Recommendation: The recommended dose of oral Ticlopidine is 250mg twice a day.
(Level I, Grade A)
Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel is a newer thienopyridine derivative. It is slightly superior to the 325 mg
daily dosage of Aspirin.63 It may be more beneficial than Aspirin in several settings, including patients
with contraindications or having adverse effects due to Aspirin and in high risk subjects with multiple
risk factors (i.e. with a previous stroke, peripheral artery disease, symptomatic coronary disease and
diabetes)64
Recommendation: The recommended dose of oral Clopidogrel is 75mg daily.
(Level I, Grade A)
Triflusal: Triflusal is a viable alternative to Aspirin in secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke at a
dosage of 600mg daily. There are less haemorrhagic complications compared to Aspirin. Triflusal is
licensed in Malaysia for the secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke.65
Recommendation: The recommended dose of oral Triflusal is 600mg daily.
(Level I, Grade A)
Cilostazol: Cilostazol is another alternative in the secondary prevention of acute ischaemic stroke at
a dosage of 100mg twice daily. Studies from Japan and China supports the safety and efficacy
of Cilostazol for secondary stroke prevention in Asian populations. However, there are as yet no
high-quality data regarding the use of Cilostazol for secondary stroke prevention in non-Asian ethnic
groups.66,67 The most recent meta-analysis showed that Cilostazol appeared to be effective for
long-term secondary stroke prevention without increasing the risk of haemorrhage.68 Combination
use of cilostazol with aspirin or clopidogrel was explored in open-label trial in Japan that showed
adult patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke who had ≥50% stenosis of a major intracranial
or extracranial artery, or two or more vascular risk factors, had lower recurrent ischaemic stroke
compared to monotherapy (3% vs. 7%) with similar bleeding rates.69
Recommendation: The recommended dose of oral Cilostazol is 100mg twice a day.
(Level I, Grade A)
Aspirin and Clopidogrel combination: Recent evidence from 2 large trials in minor stroke and high
risk TIA patients (NIHSS ≤3, ABCD2 ≥4), showed that those who received a combination of
Clopidogrel and Aspirin had a lower risk of major ischaemic events for 3 weeks to 3 months, but a
higher risk of major haemorrhage at 90 days than those who received Aspirin alone.70,71
Recommendation: Dual antiplatelet therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin) is recommended for 21 days
in patients with high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Ticagrelor: In the SOCRATES trial, Ticagrelor was not superior to Aspirin in the prevention of fatal
stroke, MI and death at 90 days in patients with minor stroke or TIA.72 However, sub-analysis in the
Asian population, showed a trend towards reduction in stroke, MI and death with Ticagrelor.73 Since
there were no significant safety differences in the 2 groups, Ticagrelor may be a reasonable
alternative in stroke patients who have a contraindication to Aspirin.
(Level II, Grade B)
Aspirin and Ticagrelor: A recent trial examining the use of ticagrelor as combination therapy with
aspirin in patients with mild-to-moderate acute non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤5)
or TIA who were not undergoing intravenous or endovascular thrombolysis, showed that the risk of
the composite of stroke or death within 30 days was lower with ticagrelor–aspirin than with aspirin
alone, but the incidence of disability did not differ significantly between the two groups. Severe
bleeding was more frequent with the ticagrelor-aspirin combination therapy than with aspirin alone.
Warfarin is not indicated for secondary stroke prevention for patients with sinus rhythm in the
absence of other conditions predisposing to cardioembolic risk.
(Level I, Grade A)
5.5.2
Anti-hypertensive Treatment
Reduction of blood pressure after the acute phase of a cerebrovascular event results in further
reduction of vascular events. This benefit was noted in both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke in
hypertensive and normotensive subjects.75 Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials confirmed
an approximate 30 – 40% reduction of stroke risk with blood pressure lowering. 76
In one study, the combination of an ACE-inhibitor and thiazide diuretic was beneficial in both
hypertensive and normotensive stroke patients when initiated two weeks after the event.77
Another study proved the superiority of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), Losartan over a
beta-blocker (Atenolol) in a specific group of high-risk patients with left ventricular hypertrophy,
including subjects with previous stroke.78
Recommendation: In the post-stroke period (2 weeks or more after stroke), ACE-inhibitor based
therapy has been shown to reduce recurrent stroke in normotensive and hypertensive patients.79
(Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: Other classes of anti-hypertensive (ARB-based) therapy appear to be effective
in selected high-risk populations.80,81
(Level II-1, Grade B)
The target blood pressure of absolute levels is not certain, but targets based on hypertension
guidelines (local or international) can be followed and should be individualized.82
(Level II-1, Grade B)

Lipid Lowering
Statins were proven to reduce vascular events among high risk patients including subjects with
previous stroke.83,84
Recommendation: Lipid reduction should be considered in all patients with previous ischaemic
strokes.
(Level I, Grade A)
The Treat Stroke to Target trial that involved 2860 patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or TIA
showed that patients who achieved a target LDL of 1.8 mmol had a lower cardiovascular and stroke
events at 3.5 years than those with a target LDL of 2.5 mmol/L.85
Recommendation: LDL target of 1.8 mmol/L is recommended.
(New recommendation,Level I, Grade A)
5.6 Other Risk Factors
The control of risk factors such as better glycaemic control in diabetes and smoking cessation has
not been the subject of major randomized secondary prevention clinical trials. Although diabetes is
recognized as an independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke, better diabetes control resulted only in
the reduction of microvascular but not macrovascular complications.86 Inferences can also be drawn
from positive results of primary prevention trials (see primary prevention section). Nevertheless,
better control of these risk factors should be advocated for better overall health after an ischaemic
stroke.
Recommendation: All diabetic patients with a previous stroke should maintain a good glycaemic
control.
(Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: All smokers should stop smoking.

5.7 Cardioembolism
Cardioembolic stroke accounts for about 20% of all ischaemic strokes.87-89 Generally, they are
severe, prone to early recurrence, and more likely when there is documented source of embolism
and involvement of different cerebrovascular territories or multiple infarctions. The predominant
pathogenic process for stroke associated with cardiac disease is embolism due to formation of
intra-atrial and intra-ventricular thrombus.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) whether chronic or paroxysmal, is the most common cause of cardioembolism
and accounts for 50% of all cardiogenic emboli. Other high-risk conditions are having prosthetic
heart valves, rheumatic mitral valvular disease, acute myocardial infarction, and severe left
ventricular dysfunction. Non-thrombotic embolism may result from atrial myxoma and endocarditis.
Investigations are directed at demonstrating cardiac sources of embolism in the absence of
significant atherosclerosis or other vascular disease. All patients with stroke/TIA require a 12-lead
electrocardiogram. A 72-hour Holter monitor is required to detect paroxysmal AF. In addition, all
patients under 45 years of age and those in whom baseline investigations did not reveal an apparent
cause for stroke will require a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Patients in whom there is high
suspicion of cardioembolism
but have
a normal TTE
may
undergo a trans-oesophageal
echocardiogram (TOE). Conditions in which this method is superior to TTE include thrombi in the left
atrium and left atrial appendage, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal aneurysm and aortic arch
atheroma.89,90
Oral anticoagulant may reduce the risk of first and subsequent stroke for selected high-risk cardiac
conditions but must be weighed against the risk of haemorrhagic complications.87,88,91,92 (see table
5.4)
Patients with low risk cardiac conditions (such as mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation, atrial
septal aneurysm, and patent foramen ovale) without additional risk factors may be offered Aspirin
75-325mg/day for primary prevention of stroke.
(Level III)
If patients are Aspirin intolerant then consider: Clopidogrel 75mg daily, Ticlopidine 250mg bd or
Dipyridamole 400mg daily.87
(Level III, Grade C)
Anticoagulation is not indicated for non-thrombotic causes of cardiac emboli and may cause
substantial intracranial haemorrhage in infective endocarditis of native valves.87
Anticoagulation is not proven to reduce recurrent stroke in the first 14 days following an acute
cardioembolic event [Level I] with the possible exception of prosthetic heart valves, recent MI,
presence of intra-cardiac thrombus, AF with additional risk factors and previous stroke.89 (see table
5.5)

5.8 Revascularisation Procedures
Surgical procedures in stroke management may be classified to procedures performed to prevent
first stroke occurrence (primary prevention in asymptomatic patients) or following a stroke event
(secondary prevention).
5.8.1
Primary Prevention
Carotid
endarterectomy
(CEA)
has
been
compared
to
conservative
medical
therapy
for
asymptomatic patients without prior history of TIA or stroke for whom imaging of the carotid arteries
reveals a definite stenosis. Of the 5 published randomized studies, only 2 were sufficiently powered
to compare the outcomes between surgery and medical therapy. The absolute 5-year risk reduction
for patients with 70-99% carotid artery stenosis (by ultrasound) was 5.4% in the recent follow-up of
the ACST trial, which was consistent with the ACAS study from North America (5-year absolute risk
reduction of 5.9%).99,100 This translates into a 1% annual stroke rate reduction. Patients who are
asymptomatic and receiving appropriate medical therapy face an annual stroke rate of 2% without
CEA. Surgical morbidity and mortality often exceed this beneficial risk reduction. In the ACST and
ACAS trials, surgery-related events were 3.1% and 2.3%, respectively.99,100 In an unselected patient
group undergoing CEA in a centre without proper auditing of the surgeon or the centre’s operative
records, the complications are likely to outweigh the benefits of CEA. Furthermore, asymptomatic
patients should not be offered CEA if their 5-year probability of dying from unrelated causes is high.
Finally, in the NASCET study, nearly 45% of all strokes occurring in patients with asymptomatic
stenosis may be attributable to lacunar infarcts or cardioembolism.101
Recommendation: Endarterectomy may be considered in patients with high-grade asymptomatic
carotid stenosis (70-99%) when performed by a surgeon with less than 3% morbidity/ mortality rate.
(Level I, Grade A)
Careful patient selection, guided by comorbid conditions, life expectancy, and patient preference,
followed by a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of the procedure is required. It is
important that asymptomatic patients receive appropriate medical treatment and be fully evaluated
for other treatable causes of stroke.
5.8.2
Secondary Prevention
Two large randomized trials (NASCET and ECST) have compared the outcomes of patients with
recent cerebrovascular symptoms treated conservatively or with carotid endarterectomy.102,103
Long-term follow-up and a meta-analysis is available for these trials.104 Standardizing the same
measurements and definitions yielded highly consistent results among the 3 trials. In general, CEA is
highly beneficial for patients with carotid stenosis (70-99%), producing a 16% absolute 5-year risk
reduction (ARR). For patients with 50-69% stenosis, the 5-year ARR was 4.6%. No benefit was
observed for patients with milder degrees of stenosis. Subgroup analyses revealed that benefits in
surgery was the greatest in men, aged 75 years or older, and those randomized within 2 weeks of
their stroke event. These studies excluded patients with medical co-morbidities, previous neck
irradiation and recurrent stenosis following previous endarterectomy.
Extracranial-intracranial anastomosis between the superficial temporal and middle cerebral arteries
(EC-IC Bypass) has not been shown to be beneficial for secondary stroke prevention by the EC/IC
Bypass Study Group.
Recommendation: CEA is indicated for patients with carotid stenosis of 70-99% without a severe
neurological deficit following a recent ischaemic event (less than 180 days) in centres with a
perioperative complication rate for all strokes and deaths of less than 6%.
(Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: Early CEA is indicated for patients with carotid stenosis of 70-99% without a
severe neurological deficit within 2 weeks of recent ischaemic events in centres with a perioperative
complication rate for all strokes and deaths of less than 6%.
(Level II-1, Grade B)
Recommendation: CEA may be indicated for patients with carotid stenosis of 50-69% without a
severe neurological deficit with recent ischaemic event (less than 180 days) in centres with a
perioperative complication rate for all strokes and deaths of less than 6%.
(Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: CEA is not recommended for patients with carotid stenosis less than 50%.
(Level I, Grade A)
CEA should not be performed in centres not exhibiting low complication rates similar to those seen
with NASCET or ECST.
(Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: Patients should remain on antithrombotic therapy before and after surgery.
(Level II-2, Grade B)
Recommendation: External/internal carotid bypass is not recommended for secondary stroke
prevention.
(Level I, Grade A)
5.9 Angioplasty or Stenting
This is a rapidly evolving field in stroke treatment and prevention. Several randomized trials have
compared
extra-cranial
carotid
angioplasty
and
stenting
(CAS)
to
carotid
endarterectomy
(CEA).99,101,105,106
Recommendation: CAS represents a feasible alternative to carotid endarterectomy for secondary
stroke prevention when surgery is undesirable, technically difficult, or inaccessible.107,109
(Level II-2)
In recent studies, the 4-year outcome in death, stroke and myocardial infarction was similar in CAS
and CEA. However, the periprocedural rate of stroke was higher in the CAS group while the
periprocedural rate of myocardial infarction was higher in the CEA group. Selection of patients for
either CAS or CEA may require attention to age, with younger patients having a slightly better
outcome with CAS and older patients having a better outcome with CEA.106-112
The criteria needed for a centre to do CAS:
I.
highly qualified surgeons and interventionists
II.
surgeons and interventionists that are credentialed
III.
must use distal embolic protection device
IV. use of dual antiplatelet therapy after CAS for at least 4 weeks
Recommendation: Distal protection devices should be used during the procedure and use of dual
antiplatelet for at least 4 weeks after CAS.
(Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: Complex configuration of the aortic arch and internal carotid artery tortuosity
increase the risk of cerebral ischemia in CAS.113
(Level II-2, Grade B)
Intracranial artery stenting (IAS) is also technically feasible but has not been proven to be an
established treatment modality. A re-stenosis rate of up to 30% has been reported.105 Clinical data
has much less evidence with more controversy as compared to carotid angioplasty.105 The
SAMMPRIS and VISSIT randomized trials found that patients with symptomatic intracranial
atherosclerosis treated with angioplasty and stenting had worse outcomes than those who received
medical therapy 114,115.
The role of CAS in intra-cranial stenoses, asymptomatic stenoses and acute stroke is unclear and
may not be recommended.102,103,116 However, the most recent study (WEAVE Trial) showed that with
experienced interventionalists, and proper patient selection, the use of the stent for intracranial
atherosclerotic disease demonstrated a low periprocedural complication rate and excellent safety
profile.117
Therefore, careful selection with extensive multidisciplinary discussions by centres experienced in
stroke management is recommended. As angioplasty with or without stenting is still an
investigational procedure, it should be carried out under appropriate clinical trial protocols.
Recommendation: Role of IAS in intra-cranial stenoses, asymptomatic stenoses and acute stroke is
unclear and may be recommended.

Key Recommendations:
1.
Stroke is a preventable disease and may be attributed to modifiable and non-modifiable risk
factors.
2.
Modifiable risk factors are the focus of primary prevention and can be clustered into three main
groups i.e.
a) Lifestyle risk factors, i.e., smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating
b) Metabolic risk factors, i.e., high systolic BP, high cholesterol, high fasting blood glucose,
low eGFR and high BMI.
c) Environmental factors, i.e., air pollution and lead exposure.
3.
Secondary prevention of stroke involves the prevention of recurrent stroke, and this may involve
medical interventions includes antiplatelet therapy, anti-hypertensive treatment, lipid-lowering
agents, glycaemic control, prevention of cardio-embolism and re-vascularisation procedures in
selected cases.

Key Recommendations:
1. Investigations carried out in stroke are aimed to confirm the diagnosis, determine the
mechanism of stroke, stratify risk, and to identify potential treatable vascular lesions.
2. Computed tomography (CT) brain is mandatory and is the preferred imaging investigation in
the emergency setting to differentiates haemorrhage, determine the site, cause, and extent of
the lesion.
3. Advance imaging may be required in selected cases in the emergency settings, e.g., ruling
out stroke mimics, reperfusion therapy in extended hours and determining potential
re-vascularisation procedure.
4. Selected blood investigations and imaging will be required in certain patients to determine the
aetiology of stroke.
EMERGENCY MEDICINE SERVICES
Most people with acute stroke (95%) have their first symptoms out of hospital.1 Based on data in
other countries, approximately two-thirds of all patients who seek acute care for stroke arrive to the
emergency department by ambulance.2
Specific therapies for acute stroke, namely intravenous thrombolysis, and endovascular treatment
(EVT) are time-critical treatments. Thus, they are most effective when initiated soon after the onset of
symptoms. Proper treatment and disposition of stroke patients begins from the out-of-hospital
environment, subsequently continues in the emergency department (ED), and extends to the
inpatient admission. Therefore, it is essential for Emergency Medicine and Trauma Service (EMTS)
personnel, Medical Emergency Coordination Centre (MECC) or Ambulance Dispatch Centre (ADC)
personnel, and/or pre-hospital care responders and ED personnel, to recognise stroke early and as
accurately as possible. At the same time, a strong working relationship are required between
pre-hospital care staffs, ED staffs and the stroke team to improve timely assessments and early
management.
Emergency medicine management framework for acute stroke include two distinct phases:
I.
Pre-hospital care phase
II.
Emergency department clinical care phase
7.1 Pre-hospital Management
7.1.1 Public education 3,4
Recommendation: Public or community educational programmes should be designed to create
awareness and knowledge of stroke warning signs.
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
Recommendation: The educational programmes should also include the timely recognition and
need to seek emergency care by calling 999 promptly.
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
7.1.2 Emergency dispatch system 5,6
Recommendation: Ambulance Dispatch Centres (ADC) should be familiar with common descriptors
used by public for stroke. Whenever the descriptors are used, Emergency Medical Dispatchers
(EMD) are trained to use the stroke protocols to identify suspected stroke patients.
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
Recommendation: ADC should have a protocol or tools that allow Emergency Medical Dispatchers
(EMD) to identify suspected stroke patients. Examples of stroke assessment tools are the MDPS
Stroke Diagnostic Tool used by MECC, FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, and Time) stroke assessment or
CPSS (Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale).
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
Recommendation: ADC should have a system in place to allow suspected stroke calls to receive
priority in response that will facilitate early arrival of patients to the Emergency Department (ED).
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
7.1.3 Initial on-scene management 3-4, 7-10
PHC responders (a medically trained person who responds to pre-hospital calls,usually an Assistant
Medical Officer or Staff Nurse) should be familiar with the detection and management of stroke
patients.
(Level II-1, Grade A)
Recommendation: PHC responders should rapidly evaluate the airway, breathing and circulation in
patients with suspected acute stroke to identify life threatening situations, and manage accordingly.
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
There are several validated prehospital stroke screening tools which can be utilized to identify stroke
(pre-hospital diagnostic screening tools) and to assess severity of stroke (pre-hospital stroke severity
scales) (see Appendix B). Stroke severity assessment may be considered if patient demonstrate
any signs of stroke.
Recommendation: For stroke identification, PHC responders should use a validated and
standardized assessment tool such as FAST or BE-FAST (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arm, Speech, Time)
stroke assessment. Other identification assessment tools that can be used include CPSS, LAPSS
(Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen). 11-16
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
Recommendation: PHC responders should be trained to identify hypoglycaemia as a stroke-mimic
and apply appropriate management protocols.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: PHC responders should ascertain the time of onset of stroke symptoms from the
patient or witness(es).
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: PHC Service Providers should ensure its responders are made aware of the
nearest hospital capable of providing thrombolysis and hospital capable of performing endovascular
stroke treatment, within their service area. A written protocol that ensures the ambulance diversion of
the patient to such hospitals should be made available for use.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: All stroke patients from PHC with positive signs of stroke within the 4.5-hour
therapeutic window for medical thrombolytic therapy should be transported rapidly to an acute stroke
ready hospital.
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
Recommendation: Titrated doses of oxygen should be delivered to stroke patients with oxygen
saturation levels below 95%.
(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade B)
7.1.4 Pre-arrival communication (Stroke Alert) 3,4
Recommendation: PHC Responders should be trained to provide pre-arrival notification of stroke
patients to receiving hospitals. Ambulance Dispatch Centres can be used as an intermediary to
provide stroke alert communication to hospitals.
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
Recommendation: MECC and associated stroke ready hospital(s) are recommended to have local
regional stroke referral system/ network and agreement with the ED to facilitate the transport
decision from PHC to ensure the treatment window of 4.5 hours is achieved (Stroke system of care).

ACUTE GENERAL MANAGEMENT
8.1 General Management
The primary aim of acute stroke management is for early reperfusion therapy which will be covered in
Chapter 9 and 10. This chapter will cover the general management of acute stroke that includes
supportive care and treatment of acute complications. This is important to improve the mortality rates
and reduce the functional disability.
8.1.1
Oxygen and Airway Support
Adequate tissue oxygenation is imperative to prevent hypoxia and potential worsening of the
neurological injury.1-5
(Level II-3 to III)
Recommendation: Patients with acute stroke should only receive supplemental oxygen if their
oxygen saturation is below 95% and be titrated to achieve above 95%.6-9
(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade B)
8.1.2
Observation
Recommendation: Regular observation is mandatory to recognise impaired pulmonary function
(pulse oxymeter), circulatory function (pulse rate, blood pressure), NIHSS score, head chart, GCS,
and complications from mass effect.1
(Level III, Grade C)
8.1.3
Mobilisation
Most patients are first treated with bed rest, but mobilisation should begin as soon as the patient’s
condition is judged to be stable.10-13
Recommendation: Mobilise early to prevent complications.
(Level II-3, Grade C)
Although two small RCTs showed that very early mobilisation (beginning within 24 hours) was
feasible in an acute setting, the AVERT trial showed that very early, more frequent and higher dose
of mobilisation focused on out-of-bed activities in addition to usual care was worse in terms of
outcomes than usual care alone. Very early mobilisation reduced the odds of favourable outcomes at
three months.14
Recommendation: High-dose, very early mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke onset should not be
recommended.
(New recommendation, Level l)
8.1.4
Blood Pressure
In patients with AIS, early treatment of hypertension is indicated when required by comorbid
conditions
(e.g.
concomitant
acute
coronary
event,
acute
heart
failure,
aortic
dissection,
post-thrombolysis sICH, or preeclampsia/eclampsia). In patients with a BP of ≥220/120 mm Hg who
have not received IV alteplase or EVT and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute
antihypertensive treatment, the benefit of initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the
first 48 to 72 hours is uncertain. It might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours
after the onset of stroke.15-20
Recommendation: Lowering BP initially by 15% is probably safe. Very high blood pressure should
be reduced gradually.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Do not treat hypertension if systolic BP is <220mmHg or diastolic BP is
<120mmHg. Mild hypertension is desirable at 160-180/90-100 mmHg.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Proposed drugs: Labetalol 10-20mg boluses at 10 minute intervals up to
150-300mg or 1mg/ml infusion, with the rate of infusion of 1-3mg/min or oral Captopril 6.25-12.5mg.
Sublingual use of a calcium antagonist, such as Nifedipine, should be avoided because of the risk of
rapid decline in blood pressure.21
(Level II-3, Grade C)
8.1.5
Blood Glucose
Hyperglycaemia following acute stroke is strongly associated with subsequent mortality and impaired
neurological recovery. This applies to both diabetics and non-diabetics.22,23
(Level II-3, Grade C)
The International Diabetes Federation published a comprehensive guideline on managing older
people with type 2 diabetes which included a section on management of hyperglycaemia post-acute
stroke.24
At present, the optimal level of blood glucose after a stroke is unclear. A systematic review of 11
RCTs concluded that the administration of intravenous insulin to maintain tight glucose control within
a specific range (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide
benefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit, but
significantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes.25
Recommendation: After an acute stroke, treat hyperglycaemia to keep the blood glucose levels
between 6.0-10.0 mmol/L and ensure that hypoglycaemia is avoided.24
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Avoid very tight targets of glucose control (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours
of acute ischaemic stroke.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
8.1.6
Nutrition
Sustaining nutrition is important as malnutrition after stroke might interfere with recovery.26 Persons
with infarctions of the brain stem, multiple strokes, large hemispheric lesions, or depressed
consciousness are at the greatest risk for aspiration. Swallowing impairments are associated with an
increased mortality.
The FOOD RCT’s showed that supplemented diet was associated with an absolute reduction in risk
of death of 0.7% and that early tube feeding (within 7 days of admission) was associated with an
absolute reduction in risk of death by 5.8% and a reduction in death or poor outcomes by 1.2%.27,28
Recommendation: Enteral feeding should be started within 7 days of admission (oral or tube
feeding).
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
A water swallowing test (refer to Appendix C) should be performed before the patient is allowed to
eat or drink. A wet voice after swallowing, incomplete oral-labial closure, or coughing reflex on
swallowing indicates high risk of developing aspiration. There is good evidence that a multi-item
dysphagia screening protocol that includes at least a water intake test of 10 teaspoons and a lingual
motor test was more accurate than screening protocols with only a single item.29
Recommendation: Perform a water swallowing test. Insert a nasogastric tube if the patient fails the
swallowing test.
(Level III, Grade C)
An instrumental evaluation such as a video fluoroscopic swallowing examination (VFSE) or modified
barium swallow examination (MBS) can be performed later if indicated.1,30
(Level III, Grade C)
If the patient fails the swallowing test, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to prevent aspiration.
PEG tube is superior to nasogastric tube feeding if a prolonged need for devices is anticipated.31
Recommendation: PEG is superior to nasogastric feeding only if prolonged enteral feeding is
required.
(Level II-1, Grade B)
8.1.7
Infection
Infection is the commonest complication after an acute stroke especially pneumonia and urinary tract
infection.32
The appearance of fever should prompt a search for infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy
should be administered early.32 Bladder catheters should be avoided if possible.1
Recommendation: Search for infection if fever appears and treat with appropriate antibiotics early.
(Level III, Grade C)
Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics has not been shown to be beneficial.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
8.1.8
Fever
A meta-analysis suggested that fever after the onset of stroke was associated with marked increase
in mortality and morbidity.33
Recommendation: Antipyretics should be used to control elevated temperatures in acute stroke
patients.33,34
(Level II-1, Grade B)
The benefit of induced hypothermia for treating patients with ischaemic stroke is not well
established.35-38
Hypothermia should be offered only in the context of on-going clinical trials.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
8.1.9
Continence
The application of indwelling catheter should be treated cautiously due to the risk of urinary tract
infection.
Recommendation: If being used, daily assessment (with excellent perineum care) needs to be
carried out and should be removed as soon as possible.39
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: All stroke patients should be screened for urinary retention or incontinence,
faecal incontinence, and constipation. The use of portable ultrasound machine (non-invasive) is
recommended for assessing the post-void residual volume. A bladder training program should be
implemented in patient who have urinary incontinence , including the use of intermittent
catheterization based on post-void residual urine volume and bowel management procedures should
be taught to patients/carers of patients with constipation and faecal incontinence.39
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
8.1.10
Raised Intracranial Pressure
Cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure largely occur with large cerebral infarctions.
Recommendation: Hyperventilation is an emergency measure that acts almost immediately; a
reduction of the PCO2 by 5 to 10 mmHg can lower intracranial pressure by 25% to 30%.1,40
(Level II-2, Grade B)
Disability outcomes after acute stroke did not differ significantly between patients assigned to a
lying-flat position for 24 hours and patients assigned to a sitting-up position with the head elevated to
at least 30 degrees for 24 hours.41
(Level I)
Recommendation: Mannitol (0.25 to 0.5g/kg) administered intravenously over 20 minutes lowers
intracranial pressure and can be given every 6 hours.42 Maximum daily dose is 2g/kg.
(Level II-2, Grade B)
Recommendation:
If
hydrocephalus
is
present,
drainage
of
cerebrospinal
fluid
via
an
intra-ventricular catheter can rapidly lower intracranial pressure.1
(Level III, Grade C)
The pooled result of RCTs demonstrated significant reduction in mortality when decompressive
craniectomy was performed within 48 hours of malignant MCA infarction in patients <60 years of age,
with an absolute risk reduction in mortality of 50% (95% CI 34–66%) at 12 months.43
There is evidence that patients aged >60 years can benefit from decompressive craniectomy.
Hemicraniectomy increased survival without severe disability among patients aged 61 years or older
with a malignant middle-cerebral-artery infarction. The majority of survivors required assistance with
most of the bodily functional needs.44
Recommendation: Hemicraniectomy and surgical decompressive therapy within 48 hours after
symptom onset is recommended to control intracranial pressure and prevent herniation among those
patients with very large infarcts of the cerebral hemisphere.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: Patients >60 years of age may be considered for decompressive craniectomy in
selected cases.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: Ventriculostomy and sub-occipital craniectomy are effective in relieving
hydrocephalus and brain stem compression caused by large cerebellar infarctions.45,46
(Level II-2, Grade B)
8.1.11
Deep Vein Thrombosis
Venous thromboembolism is a common, potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in
patients, including those with stroke. Up to 50% of patients have thrombus in either the calf or thigh
of the paretic limb.
Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and to
possibly improve survival in a variety of patients who are immobile after stroke.47
Recommendation: For immobile stroke patients without contraindications, intermittent pneumatic
compression (IPC) in addition to routine care (aspirin and hydration) is recommended over routine
care to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Prophylactic anticoagulants (unfractionated heparin or LMWH) were not associated with any
significant effect on mortality or functional status at the final follow-up. There were statistically
significant reductions in the incidences of symptomatic pulmonary embolisms and in DVTs, most of
which were asymptomatic. There were statistically significant increases in the incidences of
symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and symptomatic extracranial haemorrhages.48
Recommendation: The benefit of prophylactic-dose subcutaneous heparin (unfractionated heparin
[UFH] or LMWH) in immobile patients with AIS is not well established.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
The CLOTS 1 and 2 trials showed that graduated compression stockings were ineffective in
preventing VTE or improving functional outcomes in stroke. Skin breaks, ulcers, blisters, and skin
necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to graduated compression stockings
than in those who avoided their use.49,50
Recommendation: In ischaemic stroke, elastic compression stockings should not be used.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
8.1.12 Seizure
Early seizures after stroke are relatively uncommon, however if they do occur, it is associated with a
poor outcome. Risk factors includes a more severe stroke severity and cortical involvement.
Recommendation: New-onset seizures in admitted patients with acute stroke should be treated
using appropriate short-acting medications if they are not self-limiting.6,39
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: A single, self-limiting seizure occurring at the onset, or within 24 hours after an
ischemic stroke (considered an ‘‘immediate’’ post-stroke seizure) should not be treated with
long-term anticonvulsant medications. The use of prophylactic anti-seizure medications is not
recommended.6,39
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Patients that have an immediate post-stroke seizure should be monitored for
recurrent seizure activity and should be treated as per treatment recommendations for seizures in
other neurological conditions and treatment should be individualised.6,39

REPERFUSION OF ISCHAEMIC BRAIN
9.1
Introduction
In cerebral infarcts, restoration of perfusion to the ischaemic brain tissues is the key therapeutic
strategy. The concept of existence of an ischaemic penumbra is fundamental to the current approach
in the treatment of ischaemic stroke. Although the core infarcted tissues might not be salvageable,
adjacent dysfunctional tissue might be saved if the circulation is restored and metabolism is
normalized.
Reperfusion therapy is the single most important and beneficial treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.
It would be considered unethical if no attempt at reperfusion is made. Reperfusion therapy can be
achieved via intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or/and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).
IVT is indicated for patients with onset of symptoms within 4.5 hours of presentation, while EVT for
large vessel occlusion (LVO) could be offered up to 24 hours using advanced imaging such as
CT/MR perfusion scan. LVO include the ICA andM1 MCA occlusions. It is reasonable to include EVT
for ACA, PCA and basilar artery occlusions.1
(Level I, Grade A)
Stroke treatment protocol and an organized stroke pathway is essential and should be established to
achieve the recommended response time for IVT and EVT, in order to improve the clinical
outcomes.1,2 Stroke organizations should incorporate the emergency department (ED) including their
pre-hospital care team, radiology department and stroke team. The management of acute ischaemic
stroke at the pre-hospital care phase and emergency department phase were explained in Chapter
7.

Stroke teams may be composed of neurologists/physicians, medical officers with/without stroke
nurses,
neuro-interventional
experts
(interventional
neuroradiologist
or
interventional
neurologist/neurosurgeon),
rehabilitation
physicians,
physiotherapists,
occupational
therapists,
speech therapists, pharmacists, social workers, and psychologists. The composition of the stroke
team depends on whether the hospital is a primary stroke centre or a comprehensive stroke centre.
Roles of the stroke team during the acute presentation of ischaemic stroke include:

to ascertain history and findings that are compatible with AIS

perform NIHSS and mRS scoring

exclude contraindications

review neuroimaging

making treatment decisions and to administer IVT and/or EVT

to closely monitor and admit patients to the stroke care unit
Recommendation: All stroke patients should be nursed/ admitted to a stroke care unit.3
(Level I, Grade A)
Suspected AIS patients within the reperfusion window should be sent to stroke ready hospitals or
hospitals with a CT scan. Therefore, a regional stroke referral system should be developed to provide
swift referral and transportation of the AIS patient to adjacent stroke ready hospitals which could be
either a primary stroke centre or a comprehensive stroke centre. IVT can be initiated at the primary
stroke centre prior to the transfer to a comprehensive stroke centre for EVT. Hospitals within the
stroke care system should adhere to the protocol to provide the best standard of care available.
In a situation where a radiologist/stroke-trained physician is not available, telemedicine may be
utilized to assist in the management of AIS patient:
Recommendation: Tele-stroke could be beneficial for sites without in house neurology or
neuroradiology services to hasten the IVT with Alteplase eligibility decision making and delivery.1, 4-6
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
Recommendation: Telephone consultation for physician is feasible, safe and may be considered if
an in-house stroke team and tele-stroke are not available.7,8

Intravenous Thrombolysis
For patients that are found to be eligible for IVT, the benefit of therapy is time dependent, and
treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible. Thus, early detection and activation of the
thrombolysis pathway is paramount and concerted effort should be made to deliver the treatment as
soon as possible.

1.
Infuse 0.9mg/kg (maximum of 90 mg) over 60 minutes with 10% of the dose given as a
bolus dose over 1 minute. A lower dose of IV Alteplase (0.6 mg/kg) was not shown to be of
equivalent to standard-dose IV Alteplase for the reduction of disability at 90 days but had a
reduced mortality rate.27
Recommendation: (Onset within 4.5 hours) Alteplase dose: 0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg, 10%
given as bolus and remaining dose infused over 1 hour.
(Level I, Grade A)
2.
Admit the patient to an intensive care unit or a stroke unit for monitoring.
3.
Perform neurological assessments* every 15 minutes during the infusion of Alteplase and
1-hour post IVT, and every 30 minutes for the next 4 hours and then every hour until 24
hours lapses from the onset of treatment. (*GCS and Blood pressure)
4.
If the patient develops severe headache, acute hypertension, nausea or vomiting or
worsening neurological symptoms with an increase of the NIHSS by 4 and reduction of the
GCS by 2, discontinue the infusion and obtain a CT scan of the brain.
5.
Closer blood pressure monitoring is required if a systolic BP of >180mmHg or diastolic BP
of >105mmHg is recorded. Administer anti-hypertensive medications to maintain blood
pressure at or below these levels.
6.
Delay placement of nasogastric tubes, indwelling bladder catheters or intra-arterial pressure
catheters.
7.
Avoid antiplatelet and anticoagulation drugs for the first 24 hours after administration of

Key Recommendations:
1.
Intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose of 90mg) is recommended for definite onset
stroke for up to 4.5 hours from the onset or the treatment window can be extended via CT
perfusion with evidence of penumbra-core mismatch up to 9 hours from the time of last known to
be well/midpoint of sleep or via MRI (DWI-FLAIR mismatch) to identify possible stroke onset
within 4.5 hours.
2.
Intravenous tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg;maximum dose of 25mg) is a possible treatment agent in
acute stroke presented within 4.5 hours with evidence of large vessel occlusion.
ENDOVASCULAR THROMBECTOMY
10.1
Acute Endovascular Thrombectomy Treatment
Acute Endovascular Thrombectomy treatment (EVT) is considered as the standard of care since
2015 following the publications of 5 RCTs which have led to a major guideline revamp around the
world.1-5 EVT is indicated in acute ischaemic stroke that presents within 6-8 hours, and is equally
beneficial in selected patients of up to 24 hours from the time last seen well (TLSW) with evidence of
large vessel occlusion (LVO).1-7
EVT should be offered at the comprehensive stroke centre if the following are available and in
coordination with the EMS:
I.
A stroke team consisting of stroke physician and radiologist with expertise in the diagnosis and
management of stroke.
II.
A stroke team consisting of neuro-interventional experts (interventional neuro-radiologist or
interventional neurologist/neurosurgeon).
III.
All AIS patients who are a candidate for EVT must at least undergo NCCT and CT angiography
from arch of aorta-vertex with or without multiphase CTA or CT perfusion. MRI with MRA can be
considered in selected cases if necessary and not as a routine modality to avoid any delays.
(New recommendation, Level 1, Grade A)
10.2
Indication for Acute Endovascular Thrombectomy
I.
Baseline functional status mRS of 0-2 or generally ADL independent.
II.
EVT is indicated in patients who have received intravenous Alteplase, but do not wait to assess
response, and those who are not eligible for intravenous Alteplase with evidence of LVO.
III.
Patients who fulfil the imaging criteria via assessment of CT cerebral angiography prior to EVT
as following:
a.
Patients should have a LVO of the middle cerebral artery or/and internal carotid artery or
proximal M2 occlusion.
b.
For large artery occlusion of posterior circulation (e.g., basilar artery), the decision to treat
should be based on the potential benefits and risks of treatment for the individual treatment.8
c.
For patients who arrive between 6 and 24 hours of stroke onset or since the time last seen
well, multimodal imaging is indicated (CT perfusion software which is capable to reproduce
similar objective assessments for penumbra and infarct core) and may be subjected to EVT
if:
10
NIHSS ≥10 and infarct core volume 0-21 mls, age ≥80 years old
or
Infarct core volume 0–31 mls, age < 80 years old
or
NIHSS ≥20 infarct core volume 31-51 mls, age < 80 years old
*(DAWN trial criteria)
OR
Infarct core volume is < 70 mls, mismatch ratio is ≥1.8 and mismatch
volume is >15 mls
*(DEFUSE 3 trial criteria)
Recommendation: EVT is indicated for AIS with large vessel occlusion; proximal middle cerebral
artery segment 1 (M1)/proximal M2 occlusion/internal carotid artery (ICA), and presenting within 6
hours from onset. 1-5
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: EVT is indicated in selected patients who arrive after 6 hours and up to 24 hours
of stroke onset with evidence of large vessel occlusion. 5,6
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
10.3
Early Revascularization
Revascularization needs to be organized immediately. The majority of the EVT studies emphasise
the importance of the early timing of recanalization through a properly organized stroke workflow,
which was lacking in the previous neutral study. It is very important to understand that the treatment
benefit declines over time; and despite recent evidence for extended hours for reperfusion therapy
via EVT, there is no reason to delay recanalization in order to maximize the possible best outcome.6,7
Recommendation: AIS patients who arrive within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and are eligible for rtPA
treatment should be considered for thrombolytic treatment prior to EVT.1-5
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: For patients undergoing “Drip & Ship” (EVT following administration of IVT),
there should be no delay in proceeding to EVT to determine the clinical effectiveness of Alteplase.1-5
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
Recommendation: AIS patients who arrive within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and are eligible for
thrombolytic treatment can be considered for intravenous Tenecteplase prior to EVT.9
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
Recommendation: Transfer to high-volume centres has been associated with reduced mortality
rates after endovascular treatment of acute stroke. This is likely to be achieved when high-volume
centres have a well-organized acute stroke pathway.10
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
10.4
Endovascular Thrombectomy Devices
Aspiration devices and Stent retriever are used widely for EVT, and these devices have been used
almost exclusively in clinical trials within the past 5 years.
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
10.5
Sedation vs General Anaesthesia
Procedural sedation is generally preferred over general anaesthesia and intubation in most patients
undergoing EVT. General anaesthesia and intubation is however, appropriate, if medically indicated
(e.g., for airway compromise, respiratory distress, depressed level of consciousness, severe
agitation, or any other indication as determined by the treating physician) and in such cases,
excessive and prolonged hypotension and time delays should be avoided.
(New recommendation, Level II, Grade B)
10.6
Endovascular Thrombectomy Work Flow
EVT should be offered at the comprehensive stroke centree when the following are available and in
coordination with the EMS as following:
Figure 10.1: Endovascular Thrombectomy Work Flow
Perform plain CT brain as per protocol, with/without CT angiography and perfusion
scan
Prepare patient immediately upon arrival
Renal profile is not required for plain CT brain or CT angiography
Book the next CT slot
Ensure that the ED transfers the patient immediately
Inform the radiologist/ interventional radiologist/ neuroradiologist on call
Suspected stroke cases receive priority
Staff receive notification from primary triage nurse/medical assistant
Assess eligibility as specified by the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guideline.
A stroke physician/neurologist should confirm eligibility and make the final decision.

extended via CT/MR perfusion (penumbra-core mismatch) or MRI (clinical-imaging mismatch)
with current evidences showed significant benefit up to 24 hours from onset/time last known to
be well. However, treatment pathway should not be delayed, as the treatment outcome can be
influenced by the imaging-to-recanalization time.
2.
Drip & Ship (IVT prior to EVT) as per Chapter 9 is recommended for the eligible patients.
STROKE UNIT
11.1
Stroke Unit
All patients with acute stroke should ideally have access to stroke units. There is clear evidence that
the treatment of patients with stroke in stroke units significantly reduces death, dependency,
institutionalisation, and length of hospital stay as compared to treatment in the general medical
ward.1-7
Recommendation: Every hospital should set up a stroke unit as it can significantly reduce deaths,
dependency, institutionalisation, and the length of hospital stay.
(Level I,Grade A)
This benefit is independent of the patients’ age, gender, co-morbidities, and stroke severity.1,8
(Level I)
The benefits from treatment in a stroke unit are comparable to the effects achieved with intravenous
administration of rtPA.9
(Level III)
A stroke unit is a dedicated unit in the hospital that exclusively manages stroke patients. A team of
specially trained staff provide coordinated multidisciplinary care throughout the day for 24 hours to
patients treated in a stroke unit. The core specialities of the stroke team are medical personnel
(neurologists, geriatricians, or general physicians with interest in stroke), medical rehabilitation
physicians, pharmacists, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. In
larger centres, the team may consist of neurosurgeons, social workers, and dieticians. The
effectiveness of a stroke unit is not necessarily related to a certain medical specialty. A stroke unit
run by general physicians, geriatricians, neurologists, or specialists in rehabilitation medicine may
equally be effective.1
(Level I)
Ideally, a stroke unit should have/provide:
I.
A geographically defined unit
II.
A coordinated multi-disciplinary team that meets regularly for the exchange of information about
inpatients with stroke
III.
Information, advice, and support for people with stroke and their family/carers
IV.
Management protocols for common problems based upon the best available evidence
V.
Close links with the primary care setting, community services and patient’s welfare unit
VI.
Training for healthcare professionals in the specialty of stroke
VII. The use of comprehensive specialized stroke care (stroke units) that incorporates rehabilitation
services is recommended. It has been shown to reduce mortality and disabilities.1
Recommendation: The use of comprehensive specialized stroke care (stroke units) that
incorporates rehabilitation services is recommended.
(Level I, Grade A)
Possible benefits of having stroke units include early treatment, reduced incidence of infection and
systemic complications as well as early and more intense rehabilitation.10
(Level I)
11.2
Multidisciplinary Team in Stroke Unit
The core multidisciplinary team on a stroke unit should consist of healthcare professionals with
stroke expertise including physicians, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech
therapists, social workers, and dietitians.11
(Level I, Grade A)
Additional members of multidisciplinary team may include clinical pharmacists, discharge planner or
case managers, psychologists, palliative care specialists, spiritual care providers and peer support
groups.
(Level II, Grade B)
Role of multidisciplinary team:
I.
Should assess patients within 48 hours and formulate management plan.
II.
Assessment components include dysphagia screening, mood and cognition, mobility, functional
assessment, temperature, nutrition, bowel and bladder function, skin breakdown and venous
thromboembolism prophylaxis.
III.
Discharge planning and individualized assessment for post-acute rehabilitation services should
also be discussed as soon as the patient has been stabilized.
Recommendation: A stroke unit should be managed by a multidisciplinary stroke team.
(Level I, Grade A)
Stroke units will work optimally if a well-established referral and rehabilitation network is available.
Cooperation with primary care physicians is essential for the primary and secondary prevention of
strokes.
Regular communications and coordinated care are key aspects of the stroke unit.
Standardized stroke orders or integrated stroke pathways improve adherence towards the best
practices for the treatment of patients with stroke.12,13

STROKE IN THE OLDER PERSON
12.1 Introduction
An older person is defined as those aged 60 years and above by the Malaysian Ministry of Health. As
the average age of getting a stroke in Malaysia is 63 years, a significant number of stroke survivors
are in the older age group.
Older persons are heterogenous in nature and their physical and functional status can range from
very fit to very severely frail. An older person may also have cognitive function ranging from excellent
to severe dementia. Older age alone should not be an exclusion criterion for stroke treatment without
considering functional status and medical co-morbidities. This is providing that the older person fulfils
the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the treatment.
Frailty is defined as reduced physiological reserve causing a person to be more susceptible to insults.
A useful scale in determining an older person’s fitness/frailty level is the Clinical Frailty Scale.1 A fit
older person’s treatment plan can have goals that approximate those of a younger person. However,
a hallmark of frailty is that the person has reduced tolerance to medical treatment and interventions.
Hence, frail older persons need to be assessed closely for side effects and adverse events from
treatment. Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for stroke treatment examine frailty as a factor
associated with outcomes. Therefore, the clinician needs to make individualised decisions for
treatment based on each older person’s characteristics.
Recommendation: All older adults should be screened for frailty using a validated instrument
suitable for the specific setting or context with a tailored management plan thereafter.2
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
12.2 Treatment of acute stroke
12.2.1 Stroke Thrombolysis
The Cochrane review and meta-analysis shows that older patients benefit at least as much as those
below the age of 80 years, so there is no upper age limit for stroke thrombolysis treatment,
particularly within the first 3 hours.3 Patients with mild and severe stroke and those with early signs of
infarction on initial brain imaging also benefit from treatment, as long as early radiological changes
are consistent with the stated time of onset.
Recommendation: An older person should receive and can benefit from intravenous thrombolysis.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
12.2.2 Endovascular Thrombectomy
A meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials with 1287 patients, on endovascular
thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel ischaemic stroke versus control, showed that there
was benefit across all age-groups in significantly reducing post-stroke dependency at 90 days,
including in those aged 80 years and above.4
Recommendation: An older person can benefit from endovascular thrombectomy for anterior
circulatory large vessel occlusion.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
12.2.3 Management of glucose level in the acute phase of stroke
The International Diabetes Federation published a comprehensive guideline on managing older
people with type 2 diabetes which included a section on management of hyperglycaemia post-acute
stroke.5
At present, the optimal level of blood glucose after a stroke is unclear. A systematic review of 11
RCTs concluded that administration of intravenous insulin to maintain tight glucose control within a
specific range (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide
benefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit, but
significantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes.6
Recommendation: After an acute stroke, treat hyperglycaemia to keep the blood glucose levels
between 6.0-10.0 mmol/L (110-180 mg/dL) and ensure that hypoglycaemia is avoided.5
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Avoid very tight targets of glucose control (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours
of acute ischaemic stroke.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
12.3 Management of risk factors for stroke prevention
12.3.1 Hypertension
Older persons may develop orthostatic hypotension, have falls and syncope when prescribed with
multiple
antihypertensive
medications.
Home
BP
monitoring
may
supplement
clinic
BP
measurements for a more reflective picture of the overall BP control.
Older persons with high frailty levels, advanced cognitive impairment, or terminal illness, requires
accurate prognostication, risk stratification and setting of treatment goals. These population groups
are not represented in large RCTs and therefore have no demonstrated safety data for intensive BP
lowering.7
Recommendation: Older persons who have one or more of the following: frailty, multiple
comorbidities, cognitive impairment, require an individualised approach for blood pressure
management.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
12.3.2 Diabetes Mellitus
In older people, therapeutic decisions on blood glucose control should be based on comprehensive
assessment and individualized risk stratification of key risk factors. Hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia
and their consequences, comorbidities, frailty, falls, pain, medication adherence, and medicine
related adverse events, and life expectancy should be considered when planning and monitoring
care for older people with diabetes mellitus.5,8
Recommendation: Targets of blood glucose control in older persons with diabetes should be
individualised taking into account their functional status, medical comorbidities, and likelihood of
developing adverse events.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
12.3.3 Dyslipidaemia
A meta-analysis of 28 RCTs with 186,854 participants of whom 14483 (8%) were aged 75 years and
above, showed that statin therapy produced significant reductions in major vascular events including
stroke, regardless of age. However, there is less direct evidence of benefit among patients older than
75 years for the purpose of primary prevention of vascular events. In particular, in patients aged over
75 years, the reduction in stroke rates was not found to be significant.9
Recommendation: Statins are recommended for stroke prevention in older persons with less direct
evidence of benefit for stroke prevention and primary prevention of vascular events in those aged
over 75 years.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
12.3.4 Atrial Fibrillation
Older persons with atrial fibrillation can benefit from anticoagulation for stroke prevention, either with
warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). DOACs were found to have a better efficacy/risk ratio
as compared to warfarin.10,11 However, the cost of DOACs are considerably higher than warfarin, in
terms of the medications themselves.
It is important to follow the individual DOACs prescription guidelines taking into consideration their
age, body weight and creatinine clearance to determine the appropriate dose of the DOAC. A higher
percentage of older persons have impaired renal function, low body weight and sarcopenia.
Prescribing a DOAC without following the prescription guidelines results in a higher number of
strokes and adverse events.12
Falls and dementia are not absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, the decision needs to be
made on an individualised basis. Falls prevention measures and carer education are important in
these circumstances.
The 2019 Beers criteria recommend that rivaroxaban and dabigatran are prescribed with caution in
older persons aged 75 years and above due to the higher risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.13
The OAC-FORTA (Oral Anticoagulant – Fit for the Aged) guidelines recommend apixaban as
FORTA-A (highly beneficial) in older persons and the other DOACs and warfarin as FORTA-B
(beneficial).11
Recommendation: Older persons with atrial fibrillation can benefit from oral anticoagulant for stroke
prevention with an individualised treatment plan taking medical co-morbidities, functional status, and
social factors into consideration.
(New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)
12.4 Medication management in the older person with stroke
Older persons, especially those who had a stroke and several stroke risk factors, are more likely to
experience polypharmacy (≥5 medications) with high pill burden, adverse events from medications,
drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and the high cost of treatment.
When prescribing for an older person, it is advisable to
- simplify the medication regime
- choose where possible, medications that require once a day administration
- consider renal and liver function, and presence of anaemia
- consider swallowing function
- check the body weight
- deprescribe or reduce dosages or number of medications by prioritising medical conditions,
reviewing targets of treatment and side effects
- check for potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions
Recommendation: A comprehensive care plan for a frail older person should include management
of polypharmacy.2
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
12.5 Delirium post-acute stroke
Delirium is a common complication of stroke, affecting at least 1 in 4 acute stroke patients.14 Delirium
in post-stroke is associated with higher mortality, increased length of stay and worse functional
outcome.15-17 Risk of developing post-stroke delirium is higher in patients with advanced age,
pre-stroke cognitive impairment, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, left cortical stroke, visual
disturbances, more severe stroke and platelet to white-cell count ratio < 20.22 .14,16-18 A majority of
delirium were detected on the first day of admission and the remainder appeared within the next 5
days.14,18
The 4AT is a validated tool to screen for delirium in acute stroke patients (sensitivity 90 - 100%;
specificity 65 - 86%). It allows assessment for all (including non-verbal) patients.19
Recommendation:
All
post-stroke
patients
should
be
screened
for
delirium
throughout
hospitalization.14,20
(New recommendation, Level II-2, Grade B)
Recommendation: Screening for post-stroke delirium using the 4AT tool is recommended.
(New recommendation, Level II-2, Grade B)
Recommendation: A
multi-component intervention for post-stroke delirium prevention and
management should be implemented to decrease incidence of delirium and its severity as well as to
reduce the length of stay. 21,22
(New recommendation, Level II-2, Grade B)
12.6 Falls prevention post-stroke
Falls are common adverse events post-stroke. The incidence is 7% in the first week but can be as
high as 73% one year after suffering a stroke.23,24 Post-stroke falls may result in serious injury (such
as fragility fracture), fear of falling, activities limitation, increased dependence and higher cost of
care.25,26 Although any patients with residual difficulties following a stroke are at risk of falls, patients
with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2 are at greater risk of falls.27 This inverse U-shaped
relationship suggests interplay between opportunities of falling and susceptibility to falls.28
Although interventions for preventing falls after stroke are largely ineffective other than those
involving exercises, people with stroke should be offered falls and fragility fracture risk assessment
and management as part of their stroke rehabilitation.29,30
Recommendation: All people with stroke should be offered falls and fragility fracture risk
assessment and management during their rehabilitation period.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
12.7 Discharge planning and early supported discharge post stroke
The process of recovering from a stroke includes treatment, spontaneous recovery, rehabilitation,
and the return to community living.
After receiving acute care, rehabilitation which is typically complex for older persons is offered as
soon as possible. Decisions about rehabilitation are made by the patients, family, and a
multidisciplinary team. Some patients may not need rehabilitation as they fully recover or have a mild
neurological deficit that does not interfere with their daily activities.
A very important stage of stroke recovery is called discharge planning and it begins with the person’s
return to community living after acute care and/or rehabilitation.31 Discharge planning is an important
and complex process following acute stroke management to ensure a smooth transition from one
level of care to another where the patient’s level of care is matched to the site of care provision. The
objective of discharge planning is to maintain the benefits of rehabilitation after the patient has been
discharged from the hospital once their goals are attained.32
The benefits of discharge planning include reduced length of stay and readmission rate, and
improved quality of life.33
Elements of discharge planning are:
1. Ensuring the stroke survivor has a safe place to live after discharge
2. Determining the level of care, assistance, or special equipment that are needed
3. Coordinating rehabilitation services or other services in the home (such as visits by a primary
care clinic’s domiciliary care team or a home health aide)
4. Determining the health care provider who will monitor the person’s health and medical needs
5. Determining and training the caregiver of the patient to provide daily care and assistance
6. Helping the stroke survivor explore employment opportunities or volunteer activities and
maintaining their social activities where possible
Recommendation: Discharge planning for older persons with stroke should occur at the appropriate
time following a multidisciplinary recommendation where any decisions about care is made in the
person’s best interests.
(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade B)
Recommendation: Hospital in-patients with stroke who have mild to moderate disability should be
offered early supported discharge, with treatment at home beginning within 24 hours of discharge.
(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade B)
Recommendation: A stroke early supported discharge team should be organised as a single
multi-disciplinary team including:
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Grade A)
●
Doctor
●
Nurse
●
Physiotherapist
●
Occupational therapist
●
Speech and language therapist
●

●
Social worker
Recommendation: Older persons with stroke and their family/carers should be involved in decisions
about the discharge and are prepared to be involved in their care.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Discharge planning should include equipment and support services necessary
including identification of the follow-up treatment.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Evaluation of home environment by an occupational therapist should be carried
out, by doing a home visit or through interview about the home environment, including photographs
or videos taken with consent given by the family members/carers.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
12.8 End-of-life care
Stroke is often the mode of death for older persons, either as a primary incident or exacerbated by
other acute conditions. The recognition that lifespan is limited or that the patient is dying should be
considered positively. Death should be recognized as an inevitability of life, and hence palliative care
should be considered a core competency of those accredited to deliver stroke care. Treatment at the
end-of-life for stroke patients needs to prioritize patient dignity and the need to facilitate a good
death.
Common burdensome symptoms at the end of life in stroke include anxiety, agitation, decubitus
ulcers, pain and issues with hydration and nutrition.34 Studies involving caregivers of those who died
of stroke revealed limited preparations for the end of life with the use of the term palliative care
equated to ‘last days of life’.35 The quality of intervention studies in palliative care in general is limited,
with available studies conducted mainly in cancer patients. Available registry studies have supported
implementation of the palliative care principles and encounters.34,36
Recommendation: The multidisciplinary stroke team should be trained in principles and practice of
end-of-life care.
(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade C)
Recommendation: Burdensome treatment should be avoided at the end-of-life care and this should
include decisions to continue oral feeding and hydration despite the potential risk of aspiration.
(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade C)
Recommendation: Advanced care planning should be provided for individuals who are expected to
have a limited life expectancy.
(New recommendation, Level II-2, Grade B)
Recommendation: Decision to withhold and withdraw treatment should take into account prior
expressed wishes of the individual with stroke which often needs to be established from the
next-of-kin and close relations.
(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Stroke teams should be prepared to facilitate the transfer of care of the
individual dying of stroke to their own homes supported by local hospices and palliative care services
if available.

13.1
Cardioembolic Stroke
Cardioembolic stroke accounts for about 20% of all ischaemic strokes.1-3 They are generally severe,
prone to early recurrence, more likely to happen when there is documented source of embolism and
involve different cerebrovascular territories or multiple infarctions. The predominant pathogenic
process for stroke associated with cardiac disease is embolism due to the formation of intra-atrial
and intra-ventricular thrombi.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) whether chronic or paroxysmal, is the most common cause of cardioembolism
and accounts for 50% of all cardiogenic emboli. Other high-risk conditions are prosthetic heart valves,
rheumatic mitral valvular disease, acute myocardial infarction, and severe left ventricular dysfunction.
Non-thrombotic embolism may result from atrial myxoma and endocarditis.
Investigations are directed at demonstrating cardiac sources of embolism in the absence of
significant atherosclerosis or other vascular disease. All patients with stroke/TIA require a 12-lead
electrocardiogram. A 72-hour Holter monitor is required to detect paroxysmal AF. In addition, all
patients under 45 years of age and those in whom baseline investigations do not reveal an apparent
cause for stroke will require a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Patients in whom there is high
suspicion of cardioembolism not found on TTE may undergo a trans-oesophageal echocardiogram
(TOE). Conditions in which this method is superior to TTE include identifying thrombi in the left atrium
and left atrial appendage, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal aneurysm and aortic arch atheroma.3,4

STROKE IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
14.1
Stroke in Young Adults
The incidence of stroke in young adults (18 to 45 years) is increasing and the prevalence is reported
to be approximately 10-15% of all stroke patients.1 The causes and risk factors of stroke in young
adults is distinct from those in older patients, in which cardiac embolism and other aetiologies are
more common, notably non-atherosclerotic arteriopathies and haematological disorders.2,3 Therefore,
the diagnostic evaluation and management strategy are usually more comprehensive and
challenging. This chapter will cover the aetiology and risk factors in young adults with stroke, in
addition to the diagnosis and management of specific causes of stroke in young adults.
14.2
Young Stroke Aetiology
The causes of ischaemic stroke in young adults are diverse and vary by age, gender, and
geographic region.4 The causes may be classified according to the TOAST classification.
Non-atherosclerotic arteriopathies such as arterial dissection as well as premature atherosclerosis
due to hypertension, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidaemia are collectively the most common
causes of ischaemic stroke in young individuals.3,5 But often, the cause of the stroke is unknown.6
Cryptogenic stroke is defined as stroke without any probable cause identified after adequate
diagnostic evaluation.7-10 Cryptogenic stroke has been reported in up to 40% of young stroke cases.4
In 2014, the clinical construct of “embolic stroke of undetermined source” (ESUS) was introduced to
identify patients with non-lacunar cryptogenic ischaemic strokes in whom embolism was the likely
stroke mechanism. About 1/6 of stroke patients are labelled as ESUS and they are generally younger
patients with milder stroke but are associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence.7,8 To date, there
is no evidence to suggest the role of anticoagulants in the management of ESUS.


“Highly cryptogenic” (i.e., with no probable and no possible cause discovered) vs “of possibly
determined origin” (i.e., with no probable, but one or more possible, causes identified)
Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS):

Sub-group of patients with cryptogenic ischaemic strokes with a high possibility of an occult
embolic source of stroke (e.g. undetected paroxysmal AF, aortic arch plaque, and occult cancer).

Criteria: (1) non-lacunar stroke detected by CT or MRI; (2) absence of extracranial or intracranial
atherosclerosis causing 50% luminal stenosis in arteries supplying the ischaemic area; (3)
absence of a major-risk cardiac source of embolism; and (4) absence of any other specific cause
of index stroke. Lacunar stroke is defined as a subcortical infarct 1.5 cm in its largest dimension
and in the distribution of the small, penetrating arteries.

Management is long-term antiplatelet with no evidence for oral anticoagulants. One RCT showed
direct oral anticoagulants (Rivaroxaban) is not superior to aspirin in prevention of recurrent stroke
and associated with higher risk of bleeding. Prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring to detect AF
is more important as occult AF occurs in about 25% of all ESUS.
14.3 Stroke Patients with Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)
Recommendation: PFO closure devices have moderate benefit to young and middle-aged patients
with cryptogenic ischaemic stroke. PFO closure devices combined with antiplatelet therapy is also
recommended.19
(New recommendation, Level I, Class A)
In patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and a patent foramen ovale
(PFO) who are not treated with anticoagulation treatment, antiplatelet therapy is recommended.20
(New recommendation, Level II-1, Class B)
Recommendation: Among ischaemic stroke or TIA patients who have both a PFO and a venous
source of embolism, anticoagulation is indicated based on the characteristics of stroke.20
(New recommendation, Level I, Class A)
When anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, an inferior vena cava filter can be inserted.20
(New recommendation, Level III, Class C)
In patients with PFO and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PFO closure with a transcatheter device may
be considered depending on the risk of recurrent DVT.20
(New recommendation, Level III, Class C)
PFO closure during pregnancy is not recommended.21 Low-dose oral Aspirin is the first line of
treatment.21 If a pregnant patient with a known PFO is at increased risk of venous thrombosis,
prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) doses can be considered.21
In one study, in patients who had a recent cryptogenic stroke due to PFO with an associated atrial
septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, the rate of stroke recurrence was lower in patients with
combined PFO closure/antiplatelet therapy compared to patients with antiplatelet therapy alone.22
However, the closure of PFO was associated with a higher frequency of atrial fibrillation.22

Cerebral Venous Thrombosis
CVT is a type of stroke where the thrombosis occurs in the venous side of the brain circulation,
leading to occlusion of one or more cerebral veins and dural venous sinus. The age and gender
distribution of CVT is different from that of ischaemic stroke, CVT being more frequent in young
adults and women. The incidence is higher in developing countries. CVT is associated with
prothrombotic conditions either due to transient causes or permanent primary causes. In around 13%
of adult with CVT, no risk factors are identified. The European Stroke Organization guideline
addresses both diagnostic and therapeutic topics in CVT.10 CVT in pregnancy is outlined in the
chapter of stroke in pregnancy.

Key Recommendations:
5.
Young onset stroke requires more comprehensive investigation to determine the stroke
aetiology.
6.
Diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undertermined source (ESUS) is made
after standard evaluation to rule out possible cause of stroke.
7.
Further specialized investigations needed in the cryptogenic or ESUS stroke for example
prolonged Holter monitoring to look for atrial fibrillation or to look for evidence of patent foramen
ovale (PFO).
8.
Cerebral venous thrombosis is one of the major cause of venous infarct and would require
investigations to determine the cause of thrombosis. Treatment mainly directed at
anticoagulation with adjunctive therapy to prevent associated complications.
MANAGEMENT OF STROKE IN PREGNANCY
15.1
Burden and Aetiology
The incidence of pregnancy-associated stroke is 10.2 per 100 000 deliveries.1 The incidence rate of
stroke in pregnancy is higher in the peripartum and postpartum period, especially in the first six to
twelve weeks after delivery.2-5 In a Japanese study, most pregnancy-associated strokes were
haemorrhagic strokes (73.5%), less than a quarter (24.5%) were ischaemic strokes and rarely, there
were mixed strokes (2%).6
In a previous study, 75.7% of the patients with ischaemic stroke were arterial infarcts and 24.3%
were venous infarctions.6 Main causes of ischaemic stroke in pregnancy were congenital heart
diseases, valvular heart diseases, atrial fibrillation (AF) and inheritable coagulation abnormalities.1
Most common aetiologies of cerebral haemorrhage were aneurysm (19.8%), arteriovenous
malformation (17.1%), pregnancy-induced hypertension (11.7%) and HELLP syndrome.1
15.2
Investigations
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (without gadolinium contrast) is the radiological
modality of choice for investigating strokes in pregnancy.5 MRI of the brain in the antenatal period is
not associated with increased adverse events to the foetus.7-9 However, MRI of the brain should be
used carefully.8 MRI of the brain should only be used when the test can answer the patient’s clinical
question and provides medical benefits to the pregnant patient.8 However, antenatal exposure to
gadolinium contrast was reported to increase the risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, rheumatological,
inflammatory and infiltrative skin conditions in one study.9
15.3
Management
Blood pressure should be reduced to less than 160/110 mmHg.10 In cases of preeclampsia or severe
hypertension with neurological symptoms, the aim is to achieve an urgent and sustained reduction of
blood pressure to less than 160/110 mmHg to reduce the risk of maternal stroke.10 In acute
haemorrhagic stroke in pregnancy, blood pressure can be controlled with Methyldopa, Labetalol and
long acting Nifedipine.10 The goal is to correct the blood pressure to <160/110 mmHg, followed by
titration of the anti-hypertensive medications to reduce the blood pressure consistently to <140/90
mmHg.10 The coagulopathies should also be corrected.10
Recommendation: In ischaemic arterial strokes, Aspirin up to 150 mg daily is well tolerated during
pregnancy.5 Pregnant patients with a well-defined low risk conditions may be given UFH or LMWH in
the first trimester, followed by a low dose of aspirin in the second and third trimesters.11
(Level II, Grade B)
Recommendation: In pregnant patients with a well-defined low risk conditions, no antiplatelet other
than Aspirin can be prescribed.11
(Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: In pregnant women with a well-defined high-risk condition, Vitamin K
antagonists need to be avoided between the 6th and 12th weeks of pregnancy and also near the
term.11
During this period, UFH or LMWH can be used.11
(Level II, Grade B)
Recommendation: In addition, the pregnant patients with a well-defined high-risk condition on
DOACs should be given UFH or LMWH between the 6th and 12th weeks of pregnancy.11

Recommendation: At other weeks of gestation, Warfarin can be given.11
(Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: When the labour process is pharmacologically induced, Aspirin can be
continued.11
(Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: UFH and LMWH need to be stopped 24 hours before the induction of labour.11
(Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: UFH and LMWH should be restarted within 24 hours of delivery if there are no
contraindications.11
(Level III, Grade C)
Recommendation: Vitamin K antagonists (without a loading dose) may be restarted after 24 hours
of delivery if there are no contraindications.11
(Level III, Grade C)
Patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can be administered with either unfractionated
heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) till at least six weeks postpartum.12 The
management of the patients with dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries includes monitoring
only or using low-dose Aspirin.12 LMWH can be considered in some cases in which dissection is in
the highest thrombotic risk period (peri-partum to six weeks post-partum).12
There is lack of evidence regarding the safety of statins in pregnancy.12 Statins should be stopped
during preconception and throughout pregnancy.12 In general, stroke management decisions are
based on symptom severity, maternal medical conditions, and wishes of the patient and her family.10
Rehabilitation should be started early.10 Rehabilitation is based on a multidisciplinary team
discussions and decisions.10

STROKE THERAPIES WITH LIMITED EVIDENCE
A variety of medicines and treatment modalities have been used for stroke. Although yet to be
proven effective, they may be considered for treatment in acute stroke (Table 16.1).
Table 16.1: Stroke Therapy Modalities
Therapy
Description
NeuroAid
The medicine did not demonstrate any statistically significant benefit after 3
months although some small studies showed that it could be effective in
improving functional independence and motor recovery, and is safe for
patients with a primarily non-acute stable stroke.1-3
Citicoline
Citicoline is widely used after stroke but is not proven statistically to be
beneficial in the treatment of acute stroke.4,5
Cerebrolysin
Cerebrolysin is also not proven in the management of acute stroke.6-8
Edaravone
Meta-analysis of Edavarone showed some benefits in improving neurological
impairment in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage but was
not proven to reduce death and long-term disability in both types of stroke.9
Gingko
There was limited evidence on to support the use of gingko biloba in terms of
improving quality of life and other stroke events. As such, more studies are
needed before it can be recommended for routine use in improving
neurological and cognitive function in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.10
Vitamin B
Based on the Vitatops trial, Vitamin B supplements did not help in secondary
stroke prevention but showed some benefit if the patient had concomitant
hyperhomocysteinaemia.11,12
Folic Acid
Folic acid supplementation did not demonstrate a major effect in preventing
stroke. However, potential mild benefits in primary stroke prevention,
especially when folate is combined with B vitamins and in male patients,
requires further investigation.13
Selective
Serotonin
Reuptake
Inhibitors
Fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to
improve the functional outcomes. A study showed that even though the
treatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of
bone fractures. Therefore, recent evidence does not support the routine use
of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to
promote recovery of function.14
Acupuncture
Acupuncture, from multiple trials, did not show any significant benefit and
efficacy in terms of functional recovery after stroke.15-17 A recent
meta-analysis concluded that the apparent reduction in dependency and
improvement in neurological recovery associated with the use of acupuncture
in acute stroke are confounded by the use of open controls .However the
adverse events associated with acupuncture were generally reported to be
minor and usually did not result in stopping treatment.18
Transcranial
Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)
TMS has shown some promising results in improving the motor recovery after
stroke. However, it may need more evidence before it can be used as a daily
rehabilitation tool for r stroke.19-22
Tocovid
(Tocotrienol)
Tocovid (tocotrienol) has only been proven in animal studies to be effective as
neuroprotective treatment in stroke, but not in human studies.23-25 However,
one study showed that tocotrienol may attenuate the progression of white
matter lesion26.
Selenium
Selenium levels have been shown to be on the lower side during an acute
stroke. However, there is still no evidence of benefit from Selenium
supplementation in acute stroke although a few animal studies have shown
some benefits.27-29
Piracetam
Piracetam played a limited role in the rehabilitation of the overall language
impairment and only showed benefit as regards to the written language ability
based on a meta-analysis. Its effect on the overall linguistic level and written
language tends to emerge within a short period and declines thereafter.
Piracetam also did not significantly improve neurologic or functional outcome
in acute stroke patients.30,31
Key Recommendations:
1.
There are a variety of stroke medications and treatment modalities, but the evidence is very
limited.

A trained person in MECC who receives calls from the public
through 999 and manages the call.
Dispatch priority
Level of priority assigned to each case according to the clinical
urgency. There are 4 levels of priority: Priority 1, priority 2, priority
3 and priority 4. Priority 1 is the highest priority level in the dispatch
system.
Dispatching
system
A computerized system in MECC manned by the call taker to
manage all incoming 999 calls from the public and dispatches the
appropriate response team to the scene.
PHC responder
A medically trained person (usually an Assistant Medical Officer /
Staff Nurse) who responds to pre-hospital calls.
Pre-arrival alert
Providing notification of an incoming case prior to the patient’s
arrival.
