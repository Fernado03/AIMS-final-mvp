PREFACE
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is defined as a group of diseases
characterised by a progressive increase of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)
leading to right ventricular failure and premature death. Untreated, it is a
potentially devastating disease. However, the past decade has seen remarkable
improvements in our understanding of the pathology associated with the
condition and the development of PAH-specific therapies with the ability to
alter the natural history of the disease. Indeed, the diagnosis, assessment
and treatment of PAH is a rapidly evolving area, with changes occurring in the
definition of the disease, screening and diagnostic techniques, staging and
follow-up assessment, and a growing armamentarium of PAH-specific therapies.
These new advances provide a significant opportunity for practitioners to detect
and treat patients with PAH in a timely and effective manner, thereby improving
overall mortality, morbidity, and quality of life associated with this disease. Our
intention is to provide clear and concise descriptions of the new pathological
classification and of the recent pathogenetic insights. The diagnostic process
will be discussed in order to propose a logical sequence of investigations for
aetiology identification, disease assessment and follow-up. Special emphasis
will be devoted to an evidence-based treatment algorithm that is unique to
Malaysia, yet in-line with internationally accepted guidelines.

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVE
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The development group for these guidelines consisted of cardiologists
(adult and paediatric), pulmonologists, and cardio thoracic surgeons from
the Ministry of Health and Institut Jantung Negara, Malaysia. This is the first
edition of the PAH CPG. These guidelines have been issued in 2011 and will
be reviewed in 2015 or sooner if new evidence becomes available.
These guidelines provide:
a) A description of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) which
reflects the devastating nature of PAH that have crucial bearing on
the patient’s management
b) A description of the basic pathophysiology of PAH
c) A brief discussion on the Dana Point Classification (2008) and WHO
Functional Class Classification
d) Guidance on the recognition of clinical features and diagnostic
approach of PAH.
e) An algorithm on treatment of PAH with available therapies locally
f)
A guide on PAH disease monitoring in accordance with dynamic
changes with therapy or with disease progression
g) A guide on management of PAH in congenital heart disease.

Literature search was carried out at the following electronic databases:
PUBMED, Journal full text via OVID search engine, International Health
Technology Assessment Website, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews
(CDSR). In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were
searched to identify further studies.
The following MeSH terms or free text terms were used either singly or in
combination:
“Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension”, “Eisemengers”, “PAH-Connective
Tissue Disease”,
Searches were conducted on databases and literature up to 31 Dec 2010.
This date should be considered the starting point for searching of new
evidence for future updates to these guidelines.
Reference was also made to 2 other PAH guidelines – American Heart
Association/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and European
Society of Cardiology (ESC).
The clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members
of the development group were assigned individual topics within these
subgroups. The group members met a total of 20 times throughout the
development of the guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by
at least two members and presented in the form of evidence tables and
discussed during group meetings. All statements and recommendations
formulated were agreed by the development group. Where the evidence
was insufficient the recommendations were derived by consensus of the
development group.

SECTION A
1. Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases that affect the
small pulmonary arteries, and which form a subset of those with pulmonary
hypertension (PHT). PAH can be idiopathic, heritable, or associated with a
number of conditions, such as connective tissue disease (CTD); congenital
heart disease (CHD); portal hypertension; HIV infection, and exposure to
toxins and drugs, including appetite suppressants. All of these conditions are
characterised by sustained elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP),
increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with progression to right-sided
heart failure and ultimately death.1 Mortality rates in patients with PAH are
high: historically, the median life expectancy of idiopathic PAH (IPAH) without
specific therapy is 2.8 years from diagnosis, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year
survival rates of 68%, 48% and 34%, respectively.2 In addition, most patients
with PAH have a compromised quality of life (QoL) with limited physical activity
and social function.3
With our rapidly evolving knowledge of PAH, a number of drug classes have
been approved based on positive results from randomised clinical trials (RCTs),
namely prostanoids i.e. epoprostenol, iloprost, beraprost and treprostinil;
phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors(PDE-5) i.e. sildenafil and tadalafil; and
endothelin (ET)-receptor antagonists (ERA) i.e. bosentan and ambrisentan. All
of these drugs have the ability to significantly alter the natural course of the
disease. However, not all these PAH-specific therapies are available in Malaysia,
with patient’s access to these drugs limited by cost.
These guidelines aim to highlight the challenges of diagnosing and managing
PAH within the context of the Malaysian health care system. From a local
perspective, this information may be more clinically useful, and provide a more
accurate clinical hierarchy to guide treatment selection based on the weight of
available evidence. It is hoped that these guidelines will provide a significant
opportunity for practitioners to detect and treat patients with PAH in a timely
and effective manner, thereby improving overall mortality, morbidity, and QoL.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
2. Clinical classification
The classification of PHT has undergone a series of changes since the first criteria
were proposed in 1973. Until recently, PHT was defined by a mean PAP (mPAP)
>25 mmHg at rest or >30 mmHg with exercise. However, this classification was
recently updated at the 4th World Symposium on PHT, which took place in
Dana Point, California, in early 2008.4 PHT is now defined simply as a resting
mPAP>25 mmHg, thereby eliminating the diagnostic criteria associated with
exercise. The new Dana Point definition also suggests that a resting mPAP of 8
to 20 mmHg should be considered as normal.4
PHT is classified into five categories based in part on aetiology: PAH, PHT owing
to left heart disease, PHT associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia, PHT
resulting from chronic thrombotic or embolic disease, and PHT with unclear
multi-factorial mechanisms (Table 1).4 The classification system aims to frame
whether PHT is a manifestation of an underlying disease and provides an
understanding of the context in which PHT occurs. PAH, a sub-category of PHT
(the two terms are not synonymous), is defined as a mPAP >25 mmHg at rest
with a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP, ≤15 mmHg) and
excluding pulmonary venous hypertension.4-7

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Patients with confirmed PAH can be classified according to their ability to function
and symptom severity. A modified version of the New York Heart Association
(NYHA) functional class was adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
in 1998 to facilitate the evaluation of patients with PAH (Table 2).8 Functional
class assessments are an important prognostic tool for clinicians.2, 9, 10 However,
the WHO classification system is based almost entirely on symptoms, and it is
worth noting that wide variations in clinicians’ assessment of PAH can occur.11
Table 2: WHO classification of functional status in patients with PHT
modified from New York Heart Association classification
Class I
Patients with PHT but without resulting limitation of physical
activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue
dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class II
Patients with PHT resulting in slight limitation of physical activity.
They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes
undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class III
Patients with PHT resulting in marked limitation of physical
activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less-than-ordinary physical
activity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near
syncope.
Class IV
Patients with PHT with inability to carry out any physical activity
without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart
failure. Dyspnoea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest.
Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.
3. Pathogenesis
Under normal conditions, the pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure (mPAP
12-16 mmHg), high-capacity circuit. Healthy individuals can accommodate up
to a four-fold rise from the resting cardiac output with little increase in PAP, due
to distensibility of the thin-walled pulmonary vasculature and to recruitment of
vessels that are normally closed when at rest.12 The excess capacity is such that
approximately 70% of the vascular bed must be lost before there is an increase
in resting PAP.12
Most forms of PAH share a common pathophysiology which includes
pulmonary vasoconstriction, remodeling of the pulmonary vessel wall
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)

characterised by intimal thickening, medial hypertrophy and, in advanced
disease, thrombosis in situ.13-15 A single primary cause remains elusive. One
mechanism is believed to involve endothelial dysfunction, resulting in over
expression of ET-1.16 Endothelial dysfunction also reduces the synthesis of nitric
oxide and prostacyclin (PgI2), along with over-expression of vasconstrictors
such as thromboxane A2 (TxA2).17, 18 These factors work in concert, impairing
vasodilatory responses and exacerbating the dysfunctional vasoresponses
caused by elevated ET levels.15, 17-19 Other important pathways in the process
of pulmonary vascular remodeling include changes in potassium channel
expression, activation of vascular elastases, and increased expression of
inflammatory chemokines.20 Various growth and transcription factors have also
been postulated to be involved. These including serotonin21, platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin growth factor-1
(IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1
alpha) and nuclear factor activating T lymphocytes (NFAT).22, 23
Genetic factors play an important role in the development of PAH. Mutation
of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type II (BMPR2) gene has been
identified in approximately 70% of patients with familial PAH and 25% or less
of individuals with IPAH without family history.24 However, the relationship of
this gene mutation to the broad range of associated causes of PAH remains
unknown, and not all individuals carrying the BMPR2 mutation develop PAH. A
subject who possesses the mutation has a 10% to 20% lifetime risk of acquiring
PAH, while an individual without the mutation has a lifetime risk of PAH no
different to the general population.25
Despite the multitude of perturbations that have been demonstrated in clinical
PAH as well as in animal models of PHT, it remains unclear which are ‘causes’
versus consequences of this disorder. Regardless, the end result includes
increased vasoconstriction, smooth muscle cell proliferation, decreased
vasodilation, and fibrotic changes in medium- to small-sized pulmonary
arteries.13-15 Both vasoconstrictive and hypertrophic changes lead to increased
PVR, increasing the workload of the right ventricle. Initially, the right ventricle
compensates to maintain adequate pulmonary flow, but as the increased
workload causes the right ventricle to dilate, and eventually fails. Symptoms
such as dyspnoea and fatigue appear, initially on exertion. Eventually and often
suddenly, the right ventricle decompensates and right heart failure ensues.26
Death occurs as a result of end-stage right heart failure or arrhythmia.27

4. Epidemiology and natural history
In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institute
of Health (NIH) created a national registry of patients with PAH.28 From this
study it was concluded that the incidence of primary PAH (now referred to
as IPAH) was 1-2 cases per million population. In the following 25 years, our
understanding of PAH has significantly improved and more recent estimates of
PAH in the general community vary from 5 to 52 cases per million population.29,
30 Furthermore, it is now recognised that IPAH may manifest in both genders
and all ages. During childhood, the condition affects both genders equally.1
After puberty however, detection is more frequent in females (approximately
2:1 ratio).31, 32
For secondary causes, PAH is associated with scleroderma in 4.9% to 38.6% of
patients33-37, a condition which itself, has a point prevalence of between 30.8
and 286 cases per million population.27
The prevalence of PAH within Asian communities has not been specifically
addressed. However, it is likely that more patients will come to the attention of
clinicians as a result of awareness and greater access to medical care.
The natural history of IPAH has been well documented.2 Survival for patients
with PAH associated with the scleroderma spectrum of diseases appears to
be worse than for IPAH, and the untreated 2-year survival rate may be as low
as 40%.38 With the advent of PAH-specific therapy, more recent registry data
indicate that the one year mortality rates in patient with IPAH and connective
tissue disease associated PAH (CTD-PAH) have dropped to approximately 12%
- 15%.29, 39, 40
Predictors of poor prognosis include advanced functional class (IV)2, 9, 10 and poor
exercise capacity (<300m) as measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT).10,
41, 42 Several investigators have demonstrated the important prognostic
value of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics on survival, namely mPAP, mRAP
(>20 mmHg) and CI (<2.0 L/min/m2).2, 9, 10 Significant right ventricular (RV)
dysfunction43, 44 and elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)45 also
appear to be independent predictors of survival.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
27
5. Screening
The availability of new therapies that have been shown to slow or prevent
progression of PAH has caused a growing interest among physicians to diagnose
PAH at an early stage. High risk conditions are shown in Table 3. The American
College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Consensus Statement recommends periodic
Doppler echocardiography as part of a screening programme in patients with
scleroderma because of the relatively high detection rates in this cohort.25
Patients with more than one family member with PAH related to a mutation in
the BMPR2 might be considered for genetic testing, since a negative test would
imply that there is no higher than normal risk of developing PAH. However,
any test should be preceded by extensive family and genetic counselling.46
Other potential causes of PAH (e.g., previous use of appetite suppressants, HIV
infection, other CTDs), do not warrant routine screening.

6. Diagnosis
The diagnosis of PAH is, in part, through the exclusion of other diseases. It
requires a series of investigations that are intended to make the diagnosis,
clarify the clinical class of PAH, the type of PAH and to evaluate the degree of
functional and haemodynamic impairment. Formal guidelines and consensus
documents have been published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)5,
the National Pulmonary Hypertension Centres of the UK and Ireland47, the
ACCP6, 25, 48 and the American College of Cardiology Foundation Task Force
(ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA).49 In addition, systemic sclerosis
groups have published proposed assessment pathways for the detection of PAH
in this cohort.26For practical purposes it can be useful to adopt a sequential
approach that includes four stages5 as follows:
I. Clinical suspicion of PHT
•
Symptoms, physical examination and incidental findings.
II. Detection of PHT
•
Electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and Doppler echocardiography.
III. PHT clinical class identification
•
Pulmonary
function,
ventilation/perfusion
scans,
computerised tomography (CT), and pulmonary angiography.
IV. PAH evaluation
•

and

The approach to diagnosis is summarised in Figure 1.5, 49

6.1. Clinical suspicion of PHT
In the initial stages, the most common symptoms of PAH include breathlessness,
fatigue and near syncope.28 Since these symptoms are non-specific, PAH is
often overlooked or under-recognised until its later, more advanced stages
(such as the onset of right heart failure).This pattern of presentation may also
be responsible for underestimating the true prevalence of the disease.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
The clinical suspicion of PHT should arise in any case of breathlessness without
overt signs of specific heart or lung disease or in patients with underlying lung
or heart disease whenever there is increasing dyspnoea unexplained by the
underlying disease itself.5, 47 Clinicians should also be alerted by the presence of
symptoms in patients with conditions that can be associated with PAH such as
CTD, portal hypertension, HIV infection and CHDs with systemic-to-pulmonary
shunts.
6.1.1. Physical examination
The likelihood of PAH is increased when certain findings are present on physical
examination. Notable findings include, a left parasternal heave produced by
the impulse of the hypertrophied right ventricle, an accentuated pulmonary
component of the second heart sound (S2), pansystolic murmur of tricuspid
regurgitation, diastolic murmur of pulmonary insufficiency, right ventricular
S3, jugular vein distention, hepatomegaly, peripheral oedema, ascites and cool
extremities.25, 48 However, the absence of these findings does not exclude PAH.
PAH may also be associated with a variety of comorbid conditions. Therefore,
past medical history and symptomatic evidence of a related illness should be
considered. Potential exposure to toxic agents should be explored, including
previous use of appetite suppressants and chemotherapy agents (e.g.,
mitomycin-C, carmustine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and bleomycin).
Known exposure to HIV infection, and a history of pulmonary embolism or
deep vein thrombosis should also be considered.26 Orthopnea and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea suggest elevated pulmonary venous pressure and pulmonary
congestion due to left-sided cardiac disease. Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgias,
or swollen hands and other symptoms of CTD in the setting of dyspnoea should
raise the possibility of PAH related to CTD. A history of snoring or apnoea
provided by the patient’s partner warrants evaluation for sleep-disordered
breathing as a potential causative or contributory factor.25
6.2. Detection of PHT
To confirm the diagnosis of PHT, several investigations are required, namely
an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray (CXR) and transthoracic Doppler
echocardiogram.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
31
6.2.1. ECG
ECG changes associated with PAH include right ventricular hypertrophy and
right axis deviation in 87% and 79% of patients, respectively.25, 48 The ECG lacks
sufficient sensitivity to serve as an effective screening tool for PAH, and it is
important to note that a normal ECG does not exclude the presence of severe
PHT.
6.2.2. CXR
In the majority of patients with mild PAH, a CXR is normal. In more advanced
disease, signs suggestive of PAH include enlarged main and hilar pulmonary
arterial shadows with concomitant attenuation of peripheral pulmonary
vascular markings (‘pruning’). Right ventricular enlargement is often detected
by impingement of the anteriorly situated right ventricle silhouette into the
retrosternal clear space on the lateral CXR.25, 48
6.2.3. Transthoracic Doppler Echocardiography
Doppler echocardiography is the most useful non-invasive tool and should be
employed in patients with suspected PHT to assess pulmonary artery systolic
pressure (PASP), right ventricular enlargement (RVE), right atrial enlargement
(RAE) and RV dysfunction.25, 48 An adequate Doppler signal from the
tricuspid regurgitation jet is required to estimate PASP and can be obtained
in approximately 75% of patients.5 PASP is equivalent to right ventricular
systolic pressure (RVSP) in the absence of pulmonary outflow obstruction.
RVSP is estimated by measurement of the systolic regurgitant tricuspid flow
velocity v(m/s) and an estimate of RAP applied in the formula: RVSP = 4v2 + RAP
(mmHg). The new DanaPoint guidelines recognise that PASPs are dependant
on age, gender and body mass index. In general, however, a tricuspid flow
velocity >2.8 m/s and a tricuspid insufficiency peak gradient ≥31 mmHg at
rest are considered suggestive of PHT.50 It should be noted that, using this
definition, a number of false positive diagnoses can be anticipated especially in
aged subjects and confirmation with RHC is required in symptomatic patients.
To exclude PHT due to left-heart disease, left ventricular systolic and diastolic
function, and valve morphology and function should also be assessed. Finally,
echocardiography with contrast should be used to identify or rule out PAH due
to CHD (e.g., abnormal morphology; shunt).
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
6.3. PHT clinical class identification
Once PHT is detected, identification of associated aetiology by major classes
(Table 1)4 is required. This will be guided by clinical circumstances and may
include pulmonary function tests (PFTs), ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) lung
scanning, in addition to the Doppler echocardiography measures outlined
above. Additional tests, such as high resolution CT, spiral CT and pulmonary
angiography may also be required. (Table 4)
6.3.1. PFTs
Although lung function abnormalities have been described in association with
PAH they are generally mild and unlikely to be the primary cause of symptoms.
PFTs are therefore used to exclude significant lung disease. The exception is
a marked impairment in DLCO associated with systemic sclerosis. The DLCO of
20% of patients with limited systemic sclerosis is below normal; however, a
DLCO of <55% of predicted increases the likelihood of the presence or future
development of PAH.25, 48
6.3.2. V/Q lung scanning
V/Q lung scans should be performed to rule out chronic thromboembolic
pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) - a potentially curable cause of PHT.25, 48 Patients
with PHT who have normal V/Q scans are unlikely to have chronic pulmonary
embolism and more likely to have IPAH. In three studies, V/Q scanning showed
sensitivity of 90% to 100% with a specificity of 94% to 100% for distinguishing
between IPAH and CTEPH. A positive V/Q scan in patients with CTEPH generally
shows one or more segmental-sized or larger mismatched perfusion defects
and warrants pulmonary angiography for definitive diagnosis.25, 48
6.3.3. Contrast enhanced spiral CT and pulmonary angiography
Contrast enhanced spiral CT is indicated in PHT patients when the V/Q lung
scintigraphy shows segmental or sub-segmental defects of perfusion with
normal ventilation. Although a V/Q scan is better at ruling out CTEPH, a common
practice has been to subject patients to CT pulmonary angiography to assess
for pulmonary embolism. Typical findings of pulmonary embolism include
complete occlusion of pulmonary arteries, eccentric filling defects consistent
with thrombi, recanalisation, stenoses or webs.5
Pulmonary angiography may be useful to confirm CTEPH and assess potential
operability for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

6.4. PAH evaluation
When the clinical class of PAH has been determined, additional investigations
may be required for the exact identification of the type of PAH and to assess
the severity of the disease. Blood tests, exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary
haemodynamics are commonly assessed.
6.4.1. Blood tests and immunology
Routine biochemistry, haematology and thyroid function tests are recommended
in all patients. Screening for CTD consists of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and
rheumatoid factor. Other tests may include dsDNA antibodies, extractable
nuclear antigen, anti-centromere antibody, anti- SCL70 and ribonucleoprotein
(RNP). A HIV serology test should also be performed.5 A thrombophilia screen is
useful and may include antiphospholipid antibodies (e.g., lupus anticoagulant,
anticardiolipin antibodies) in patients with CTEPH.
6.4.2. Assessment of exercise capacity
Assessment of exercise capacity, using the 6MWT is a firmly established part
of the evaluation for PAH.51The goals of exercise testing include, but are not
limited to, determining maximal exercise tolerance; identifying functional
capacity; obtaining prognostic data; establishing a baseline measure of exercise
capacity and for monitoring response to therapy.25, 48
Distances of <300 m are predictive of poorer outcomes.42 However, the
sensitivity to change diminishes as the distance walked increases, particularly
>450 m.47 Consequently, the 6MWT may be less useful for patients in WHO
functional class I and II.
6.4.3. Right-heart catheterisation
RHC is required to confirm the presence of PAH, establish the specific diagnosis
including exclusion of pulmonary venous hypertension, determine the severity
of haemodynamic impairment, test the vasoreactivity of the pulmonary
circulation, and to guide subsequent therapy.25, 48 Parameters that should
be obtained during the RHC include RA pressure, RV pressure, PA pressure
(systolic, diastolic, mean), PCWP and CO. Haemodynamic findings that confirm
PAH include a mPAP ≥25 mmHg at rest and a PCWP ≤15 mmHg.4 A PCWP
>15 mmHg may indicate left heart disease and requires careful evaluation as
PAH specific therapies may be contraindicated.25, 48 An elevated mRAP, mPAP,
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
35
reduced cardiac output and central venous O2 saturation in patients with IPAH
is associated with a poor prognosis.5
A vasodilator study should be performed in patients with IPAH during RHC. A
positive response is defined as a drop in mPAP of ≥10 mmHg to an absolute
mPAP of ≤40 mmHg without a decrease in cardiac output5, and indicates
that a patient may be suitable for a trial of high dose calcium-channel
blockers (CCBs).48 It should be noted that less than 10% of patients with IPAH
demonstrate a positive acute vasoactive response52 and even less in other
associated conditions, such as PAH related to CTD. In many centres the test
is omitted because the response is so infrequent.49 Furthermore, assessment
of vasoreactivity is not without risk and may not be advisable in high-risk
individuals (such as those with WHO functional class IV disease). Owing to the
potential risk of severe life-threatening haemodynamic compromise occurring
with the acute vasodilator challenge, testing should be performed using a safe,
potent, and short-acting vasodilator with limited side effects (Table 5).48

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Recommendation
Right heart catheterization is necessary to confirm
diagnosis and assess severity of PAH
7. Treatment
The aim of therapy in patients with PAH is to improve survival, disease-related
symptoms and QoL. Treatment can be classified as conventional therapy and
targeted PAH-specific therapy.
7.1. Conventional treatment
Conventional treatment options include oxygen therapy in cases of hypoxaemia,
anticoagulants such as warfarin, and digoxin with diuretics in cases of rightsided heart failure.
7.1.1. Oxygen (Level of evidence C)
Oxygen can be used in patients who have nocturnal hypoxaemia due to mild
hypoventilation. Desaturation during sleep occurs in the early mornings and
can be associated with syncope and seizures. Some patients with severe PAH
develop hypoxaemia and may benefit from supplemental oxygen. Those with
PO2 < 60mmHg should be considered for long term oxygen therapy (LTOT)
7.1.2. Anticoagulation (Level of evidence C)
In the absence of contraindications, anticoagulation is recommended as a part
of the general treatment regimen to decrease the likelihood of thromboembolic
complications. Warfarin is the anticoagulant of choice and the International
Normalised Ratio (INR) should be maintained between 2 to 3. However, for
IPAH patients with a higher risk of bleeding, the target INR should be 1.5 to
2.5.49
Recommendation
Supplemental oxygen should be considered in PAH
patients with hypoxaemia (Class of recommendation I)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
37
Recommendation
Anticoagulation should be considered in IPAH patients unless
contraindicated (Class of recommendation II)
Recommendation
Digoxin can be considered in PAH patients with heart failure
with or without atrial fibrillation (Class of recommendation IIb)
The evidence for favourable effects of warfarin is based on two retrospective
series: 3-year survival improved from 21% to 49% in the series reported by
Fuster et al.,13 and the 3- and 5-year survival rates increased from 31% to 47%
and from 31% to 62%, respectively, in the series reported by Rich et al.54 For
patients with CTEPH, adequate anticoagulation is important to prevent further
thromboembolism.
7.1.3. Digoxin (Level of evidence C)
Digoxin has been shown to improve cardiac output acutely in IPAH, although
its efficacy is unknown when administered chronically.47 It may be useful
in patients with atrial fibrillation and in PAH patients with heart failure who
remain symptomatic on medical therapy.
7.1.4 Diuretics (Level of evidence C)
In patients with right heart failure secondary to PAH, increased filling pressure
can further distend an already dilated right ventricle, which in turn can worsen
function and decrease cardiac output. Therefore, although no RCTs exist,
decreasing right ventricular preload with the aid of diuretics is the mainstay of
treatment for patients with right heart failure.
Recommendation
Diuretics should be given to PAH patients with
right heart failure. (Class of recommendation I)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Recommendation
Only patients who demonstrate a positive vasoreactive
response should be treated with high dose CCBs.
(Class of recommendation I)
Recommendation
Patients with PAH should receive influenza and
pneumococcal vaccinations. (Class of recommendation I)
Recommendation
Patients with PAH must avoid pregnancy.
(Class of recommendation I)
7.1.5. Calcium channel blockers (Level of evidence C)
If, during RHC, the pulmonary vasoreactive test is positive, the treatment of
choice is high-dose CCBs (up to 240 mg/day of nifedipine or up to 900 mg/day
of diltiazem), as improved survival with long-term use has been demonstrated
in this cohort of patients.54, 56 If CCBs demonstrate no clinical improvement after
one month or are unable to achieve WHO functional class I or II with associated
improvement in haemodynamics over three months, then patients should be
treated as non-responders and PAH-specific therapies considered.
7.1.6. Vaccination (Level of evidence C)
Annual influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination are recommended
in patients with PAH.5, 47 Patients with PAH who develop pneumonia should
be treated early and appropriately. Dehydration and vasodilatation during
infection should be avoided and/or adequately treated.
7.1.7. Avoid Pregnancy (Level of evidence C)
Pregnancy in patients with PAH is associated with a high risk of maternal
death. PAH is a contraindication to pregnancy and an appropriate method of
birth control is highly recommended in women with childbearing potential.
Should the patient become pregnant, she should be informed of the high risk
of pregnancy, and advised termination of pregnancy. For those who insist on
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
39
Recommendation
Appropriate physical activity is encouraged.
(Class of recommendation IIa)
continuing pregnancy, management requires close collaboration between
obstetricians and the PAH team and disease-targeted therapies.57,58
7.1.8. Physical Activities (Level of evidence B)
Patients should be encouraged to be active as their symptoms allow.47 However,
excessive physical exertion leading to distressing symptoms should be avoided.
A recent study demonstrated an improvement in exercise capacity in patients
who took part in a training programme.59
7.1.9. QoL and non-pharmacological treatment
PAH is a chronic, life-shortening disease and many patients suffer from
limitations in their physical mobility, energy, emotional reactions and social
isolation. Understandably, many patients are affected by a degree of anxiety
and/or depression that can have a profound impact on their QoL. Assisting
patients to adapt to the uncertainty associated with their illness is important,
as is referral to psychologists or psychiatrists when needed. Support groups for
patients, families and carers are useful in improving the understanding and the
acceptance of the disease.
7.2. PAH-specific therapy
In Malaysia, therapeutic options for patients classified with WHO functional
class II, III or IV disease include bosentan, ambrisentan, iloprost and sildenafil.
The following is a summary of the evidence from clinical trials performed with
these agents. For a review of agents not available in Malaysia, readers are
directed to Jacobs and Vonk-Noordegraaf 200960, Kingman 200961, and Barst
200762, respectively.
7.2.1. Bosentan (Level of evidence A)
Bosentan is an oral dual endothelin-A (ETA) and endothelin-B (ETB)-receptor
antagonist. Activation of ETA and ETB-receptors on smooth muscle cells
mediate the vasoconstrictive and mitogenic effects of ET-1, and the prominent
role of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of PAH has been well documented.63-68 The
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
efficacy of bosentan has been extensively studied in five RCTs69-73 (including
one in patients with CTEPH74), and several open-label studies.3, 75-79 In these
trials, bosentan was associated with improvements in exercise capacity,69, 73, 76
WHO functional class,69, 73, 76 cardiopulmonary haemodynamics,69, 73, 76, 78 QoL,3,
76 echocardiographic variables,78 and time to clinical worsening69, 73 compared
with placebo and conventional therapy. On the basis of these results, bosentan
has a level A recommendation in patients with WHO functional class II and III
PAH. A summary of patient characteristics and results from RCTs with bosentan
versus placebo is presented in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2.
Long-term administration of bosentan has also been shown to deliver
favourable results. In 2005, McLaughlin et al., published survival data from an
open-label extension study of patients involved in the pivotal bosentan clinical
trials.80 The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 2-years was 89%. Similarly,
Provencher et al., published a retrospective analysis of 103 PAH patients
treated with bosentan and followed over 24 15 months.81 One, 2- and 3-year
estimates of survival were 92%, 89% and 79%, respectively. More recently, a
prospective, multicentre, Australian registry enrolled 528 patients between
2004 and 2007.39 All patients were initiated on first-line bosentan. The observed
annual mortality in this ‘real-life’ registry was 11.8% in patients with IPAH and
16.6% in patients SSc-PAH. A summary of patient characteristics and results
from long-term extension studies and registries with bosentan is presented in
Appendix 3 and Appendix 4. Results are listed alongside historical data from
the NIH registry.
The recommended dosage of bosentan in PAH is 62.5 mg bd to 125 mg bd.
Common side effects include hepatic dysfunction, headache, flushing, lower
limb oedema, palpitation, dyspepsia, fatigue, nasopharyngitis and pruritus.
The most notable side effect is liver aminotransferase elevations - a class effect
of all ERAs. Abnormal liver function tests occurred in 12.8% of patients in
bosentan clinical trials but a post-marketing surveillance system (Tracleer PMS)
reported elevated aminotransferases 7.6% patients and furthermore, only
3.2% patients discontinued bosentan as a result.79Liver function monitoring
is recommended in all patients receiving ERAs. These results suggest that
elevated liver aminotransferases can be effectively managed in the majority of
patients receiving bosentan.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
41
7.2.2. Ambrisentan (Level of evidence B)
Ambrisentan is a selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist and has been
approved for the treatment of WHO-FC II and III patients with PAH. A pilot
study and two large RCTs (ARIES 1 and 2) have demonstrated efficacy on
symptoms, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening
of patients with IPAH and PAH associated with CTD and HIV infection.82-84 The
current approved dose is 5mg daily which can be increased to 10mg daily if
tolerated. The incidence of abnormal liver function tests ranges from 0.8 to
3%. In a small group of patients who were intolerant to either bosentan due
to liver function test abnormalities, ambrisentan at a dose of 5mg was well
tolerated. However, patients treated with ambrisentan require regular liver
function testing. Ambrisentan has been associated with increased incidence of
peripheral oedema.
7.2.3. Iloprost (Level of evidence B)
Iloprost is a prostacyclin derivative and was approved by US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for WHO functional class III and IV PAH.
Prostacyclin is a metabolite of arachidonic acid produced primarily in vascular
endothelium. It is a potent vasodilator, affecting both the pulmonary and
systemic circulation. There is evidence to suggest that a relative deficiency
of prostacyclin may contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH.18Although other
prostanoids have been developed (e.g. epoprostenol and beraprost), iloprost is
currently the only commercially available agent in Malaysia.
Iloprost is administered via an ultrasonic nebuliser with a half-life of 20 to
25 minutes. Therefore, chronic use requires six to nine inhalations a day to
obtain a sustained clinical benefit.85The recommended inhaled dose is 2.5-5
ug/inhalation. Common side effects include cough, headache, flushing and jaw
pain.
At the time of writing, short-term data for inhaled iloprost as monotherapy
was available from one RCT that enrolled patients with both PAH and CTEPH.86
Overall, this study showed an increase in exercise capacity, an improvement in
PVR, and a reduction in clinical events for patients receiving iloprost. However,
other haemodynamic measures were not affected. In a study of 24 iloprosttreated IPAH patients, Hoeper et al.,87 reported sustained benefits in exercise
capacity and haemodynamics at 1 year. More recently, Opitz et al.,88 reported
event-free (death, transplantation, switch to i.v. therapy, or addition of other
active oral therapy) survival rates of 53%, 29%, and 20% at 1-, 2-, and 3-years,

respectively, in IPAH patients treated with iloprost. Patient characteristics and
results from these studies are presented in Appendix 5 and Appendix 6.
7.2.4. Sildenafil (Level of evidence A)
Sildenafil is an oral PDE-5 inhibitor. PDE-5 exerts its pharmacological effect by
increasing the activity of endogenous nitric oxide, thereby inducing relaxation
and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells.5Early clinical
studies with sildenafil in patients with PAH have demonstrated its ability to
reduce mPAP and PVR, and to produce an increase in cardiac index.89
Three RCTs with sildenafil as monotherapy versus placebo have been performed
in patients with PAH.90-92In these trials, the dose of sildenafil ranged from
60 to 240mg/day. In the largest RCT performed by Galie et al.,91278 patients
were randomised to receive placebo or sildenafil (20, 40 mg or 80 mg) orally
three-times daily for a period of 12 weeks. A significant increase in 6MWD was
observed in all three sildenafil groups compared to placebo but there was no
significant difference in effect between sildenafil doses. However, patients
randomised to a higher dose of sildenafil demonstrated greater improvements
in mPAP, CI, PVR and functional class. Results from RCTs performed with
sildenafil are presented in Appendix 7 and Appendix 8.
At the time of writing, only one study has reported long-term efficacy with
chronic administration of sildenafil.91 In that study, all data was based on a dose
of 80 mg three-times daily and a one-year survival rate of 96% was observed
(Appendix 9). The most common side effects include headache, flushing,
dyspepsia, epistaxis, nasal congestion and impaired vision.
The FDA-approved dose of sildenafil in patients with PAH is 20 mg tds
administered orally. However, higher doses, up to 80 mg tds, may be more
efficacious.
7.2.5 Tadalafil (Level of evidence B)
Tadalafil is a long actingPDE-5 inhibitor. An RCT (PHIRST) on 406 PAH patients
(about half on background bosentan therapy) treated with tadalafil has shown
favourable results on exercise capacity, symptoms, haemodynamics, and time
to clinical worsening at the 40 mg daily dose.93 The side effects are similar to
that of sildenafil.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
43
7.3. PAH-specific therapy and survival
Due to the short-term nature of RCTs with active treatments (12-16 weeks),
survival is rarely an endpoint. To date, only the prostacyclin analogue
epoprostenol has demonstrated a survival benefit compared to patients treated
with conventional therapy.41 Epoprostenol is approved by the FDA for the
treatment of patients with IPAH in WHO class III and IV, and is recommended
first-line for patients presenting with functional class IV symptoms. Despite its
benefits, the complexity of drug administration significantly limits its use.
RCTs aside, several longer-term, open-label series with active treatments
(namely epoprostenol and bosentan) have reported 1- and 2-year survival
rates of 85% to 97% and 70% to 91%, respectively.9, 10, 41, 80, 91, 94, 95 These results
are in dramatic contrast to those observed in the 1981 NIH registry, where the
median life expectancy for patients with IPAH, without specific therapy, was 2.8
years from diagnosis, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates of 68%, 48%
and 34%, respectively.2 Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of RCTs in PAH,
conducted by Galie et al.,96 suggested that active treatments were associated
with a reduction in mortality of 43% (relative risk: 0.57; 95% confidence
interval: 0.35 to 0.92; p = 0.023). When viewed collectively, these data suggest
an improvement in survival for patients treated with targeted therapies.
7.4. Evaluation of response to treatment
It is important to evaluate the response of PAH patients to treatment in order
to modify therapy accordingly. The patients can be evaluated clinically based on
symptoms (WHO functional class) and signs (right heart failure), and by using
various parameters. Parameters that have been used include 6MWD, right
ventricular function assessed by echo, natriuretic peptide, cardiopulmonary
exercise testing, and hemodynamics assessed by RHC. (see Table 14, page 61 for
suggested parameters and targets). Repeat testing is useful to assess response
Recommendation
1. Patients with symptomatic iPAH should be started on PAH
specific therapy (Class of recommendation I)
2. PAH secondary to CTD or CHD can be considered for PAH
specific therapy (Class of recommendation IIa)
3. The choice of a PAH specific drug include an ERA, inhaled
Iloprost or a PDE5 inhibitor (Class of recommendation I)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
to therapy. Patients with a satisfactory response to therapy can be continued on
treatment and followed up regularly. Patients with an unsatisfactory response
should be considered for combination therapy or other interventions including
lung transplant.
7.5. Combination therapy (Level of evidence B)
The management of patients who exhibit clinical deterioration despite targeted
monotherapy is challenging.47 A significant proportion of patients receiving PAH
specific monotherapy deteriorate despite treatment. Combination therapy is
an attractive option with the development of several therapeutic classes of
agents with different mechanisms of action and potential synergy.
The goal of combination therapy is aimed at maximising therapeutic efficacy
while limiting toxicity and potential drug-drug interactions. Although there
is limited clinical data pertaining to combination treatment, it is a common
practice in many PAH centres. Combination therapy may include, 1) initiation
with 2 or more concomitant PAH-specific therapy, or more commonly, 2)
sequential administration following clinical deterioration on a first-line agent.
Various combination therapies have been utilized. A single small trial of
concomitant therapy with epoprostenol initiation and bosentan added on
48 hours later showed only trends in improvement, without significant
benefits.46More trials achieving successful endpoints have been carried out
with sequential add on therapy using a wide range of combinations: bosentan
plusepoprostenol97; bosentan plus iloprost98-101; bosentan plus beraprost98, 101;
bosentan plus sildenafil102-107; sildenafil plus epoprostenol108-110; sildenafil plus
iloprost111-113; sildenafil plus beraprost114 and sildenafil plus trepostinil.115
For patients with PAH in WHO functional class III, the most common
combination is the addition of a second oral drug (i.e., sildenafil to an ERA or
ERA to sildenafil). This combination provides additional clinical benefits such
as improved exercise capacity, an increase in time to clinical deterioration and
improved haemodynamics compared with either class of drug alone. A few
Recommendation
The response to treatment should be monitored in
patients who are on a PAH specific drug.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
45
reports have addressed the significant pharmacologic interactions between
sildenafil and bosentan.116, 117 In a recent study, bosentan decreased maximum
plasma concentration of sildenafil by 55%, while sildenafil increased bosentan
concentration by 42%.117 The clinical importance of this interaction remains
unclear, and careful monitoring is advised.118
The second and third most common strategies involve the combination of a
prostanoid with sildenafil, and the combination of a prostanoid with an ERA,
respectively. For patients in WHO functional class IV, starting with two or
more targeted therapies simultaneously can be considered in view of the poor
prognosis and likelihood of failure of monotherapy.
At the time of writing, there are a number of well-designed studies ongoing
which should help determine the potential benefits of a variety of combination
therapies that should become available in the next one to three years
(Appendix 10). In the meantime, combination therapy remains an attractive
option and individuals with PAH who demonstrate an inadequate response to
monotherapy should be considered for a combination of two or more diseasetargeted therapies.
7.6. Atrial septostomy (Level of evidence C)
Atrial septostomy creates a right to left inter-atrial shunt, decreasing right
heart filling pressures and improving right heart function and left heart filling.
In most cases it is performed as a palliative bridge to lung transplantation.
Haemodynamics and clinical improvements have been reported, together with
successful rates of bridging to transplantation in the order of 30% to 40%.119,
120 However, its exact role in the treatment of PAH remains uncertain because
its efficacy has been reported only in small series and case reports from single
centers, usually with no matching controls.119-121
Recommendation
Patients with PAH who have an inadequate response
to monotherapy using a PAH specific drug, should be
considered for sequential combination therapy (Class
of recommendation IIb)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Recommendation
Lung and heart lung transplant is reserved for
selected patients with refractory symptoms and
should be performed in transplant centres (Class of
recommendation I)
Recommendation
Atrial septostomy is reserved for selected patients
with refractory symptoms and should be performed in
specialized centres (Class of recommendation I)
Current evidence suggests a benefit of atrial septostomy in patients who are in
WHO functional class IV with right heart failure refractory to optimal medical
therapy, or with severe syncopal symptoms.5 Furthermore, the procedure
should only be performed in experienced designated centers with an active
thoracic transplant programme. The preferred choice is graded balloon atrial
septostomy.122
7.7. Transplantation (Level of evidence C)
Lung and heart-Lung transplantation are indicated in PAH patients whose
prognosis remains poor despite maximum medical therapy.5, 47, 49 This treatment
option should be considered and early discussion with experienced transplant
physicians is recommended. However, the long waiting time and organ shortage
significantly restricts its utility.
8. Evidence-based treatment algorithm for Malaysia
The optimal therapy for patients with PAH is a highly individualised decision,
taking into account many factors including: drug availability, severity of illness,
route of administration, side effects, treatment goals, and clinician preference.
Figure 2 presents a proposed algorithm for the management of patients with
PAH. This is based on evidence from RCTs performed to date and is focused
on patients in WHO functional class II to IV, and on therapies that have been
evaluated in IPAH and available locally, and in PAH associated with scleroderma
or due to anorexigens. Extrapolation of trial results to other PAH subgroups
should be done with caution.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
47
Figure 2: PAH evidence treatment algorithm based on the availability of agents
in Malaysia (adapted from Barst et al).52
International guidelines for management of PAH include drugs like epoprostenol
which is currently unavailable locally. The algorithm presented in Appendix 12
includes these drugs based on WHO International conference at DanaPoint in
2008 and using different recommendations (Appendix 11).
9. Future therapies
Despite the fact that a cure for PAH remains elusive, we have witnessed great
advances in early diagnosis, and a dramatic increase in the availability of
therapeutic options over the past 20 years. Looking forward, several new areas
of research hold promise, including pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics,
anti-angiogenesis strategies, and growth factor inhibitors.

SECTION B
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Children
10. Introduction
The prevalence of PAH in adults was estimated to be 15 cases/million and 1-year
survival was 88% as shown in a French National Registry 29. Pulmonary arterial
hypertension in children has a poorer outcome compared to adults. The Data
in the Primary Pulmonary Hypertension National Institutes of Health Registry2
showed the median survival without specific therapy for all of the 194 patients
was 2.8 years, whereas it was only 10 months for children.
Children differ from adults due to several reasons:
a.
The anticipated lifespan of children is longer
b.
Children may have a more reactive pulmonary circulation hence greater
vasodilator responsiveness 123
c.
Despite clinical and pathological studies suggesting increased
vasoreactivity in children, before the advent of long-term vasodilator/
antiproliferative therapy, the natural history was significantly worse for
children compared to adult patients 124
11. Definition and Classification
The definition of PAH in children is the same as for adult patients i.e. mPAP > 25
mmHg at rest with PCWP < 15mm Hg 5.
As with adults, PAH in children is caused by a variety of aetiologies as classified
by the Revised WHO Classification of PAH 2008 125. However, the causes of
pulmonary hypertension in children differ from adults with idiopathic PAH
(IPAH) and PAH associated with congenital heart disease being the most
common. Other causes of pulmonary hypertension in children are shown in
the updated clinical classification of PHT (Dana Point 2008)125 (Refer to Table 1
in Section A, pg23)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
12. Diagnosis
12.1 Clinical Suspicion of PHT
The presenting symptoms in children with pulmonary hypertension may differ
from adults. Pulmonary hypertension should be suspected in any child who
presents with signs and symptoms as listed in Table 6 when there is no other
explanation.
Table 6: Signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in paediatric
patients

Signs of low cardiac output (poor appetite, failure to
thrive, lethargy, diaphoresis, tachypnoea, tachycardia,
irritability)

Children
Poor effort tolerance
Cyanosis with exertion(right to left shunt through a
patent foramen ovale)
Syncope (effort-related)

12.2 Detection of PHT
The initial tests to assist in detection of pulmonary hypertension are listed
in Table 7.

suggest PHT
Also useful to detect PAH associated with
congenital heart lesions and left heart diseases
Transoesophageal
echocardiography
Rarely required, may be useful to detect
presence of atrial septal defect
Once pulmonary hypertension is detected, all paediatric patients should be
referred to the specialized centres for further investigations. Invasive right
heart catheterization for confirmation of PAH, assessment of severity of PAH
and vasoreactivity test should only be performed in the specialized centres.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
12.3 PHT clinical class identification
Detailed history taking and further investigations should be made to determine
the underlying cause for pulmonary hypertension. Diagnosis of idiopathic
pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is made when no secondary cause is
found.

13. Assessment of Severity of PAH
Severity of PAH can be assessed by symptoms, non-invasive tests and invasive
cardiac catheterization
13.1 Symptoms
Functional class can be categorized in older children using the modified New
York Heart Association classification according to the World Health Organization
1998 48. However, in younger children, it may be more practical to use the
Ability Index (table 10) 126.

York Heart Association classification (Refer to Section A, Table 2, pg24)
Table 10: Ability Index

Patients with normal life, activity or school
Ability Index 2
Patients able to work with intermittent symptoms,

13.2 Non-invasive tests
These tests are useful in assessing baseline functional status as well as
monitoring the disease progression and treatment response.

13.3 Invasive Tests
Right heart catheterization is required to assess the haemodynamics and the
response to vasodilators. It confirms the diagnosis of PAH, assesses the severity
and guides the management.
Vasoreactivity test should be done in all cases of PAH with the exception of
pulmonary venous obstruction (IV prostacyclin may induces pulmonary
oedema)127. The purpose of vasoreactivity test is
a. To guide choice of initial therapy. Only positive vasoreactivity
test responders should be started on trial of high doses calcium
channel blockers.
b. To determine the operability of patients with congenital systemic-to-
pulmonary shunt lesions with high pulmonary artery pressure (Refer
to PAH and congenital heart disease section).

catheterization

Pulmonary arterial pressure (Systolic, diastolic and mean)

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Positive vasoreactivity response is defined as a drop in mean PAP by 10 mmHg
or more to an absolute mean pressure of 40 mmHg or less without a decrease
in cardiac output. Types and regimens of vasodilators used are similar to
recommendations for adults5.(refer to Section A, table 5, pg35) However, the
choice depends on the availability of the vasodilators and the practice of the
individual centers.
14. Treatment of iPAH in Children
Treatment for IPAH in children has improved dramatically over the past several
decades, resulting in improved clinical and hemodynamic status, as well as
increased survival. Patients should be referred to designated centers for review
and treatment of PAH.
Children are sometimes too ill to undergo cardiac catheterization and treatment
may need to be commenced first.
Decision to treat with disease targeting therapies is determine by the WHO
functional class and the vasoreactivity test response. The age of the patient
is also important because not all drugs used in adults with IPAH are safe in
children.
Goals of treatment are to improve symptoms, quality of life and survival.
General measures
a. Annual influenza vaccination and 5 yearly pneumococcal vaccination
are recommended (Class of recommendation I, Level of evidence C)
b. Pneumonia should be treated early and aggressively to prevent life-
threatening pulmonary hypertensive crisis
c. Dehydration should be avoided and/or adequately treated
d. Diet and/or medical therapy should be used to prevent constipation,
since Valsalva manoeuvres may precipitate syncopal episodes
e. Competitive sports and isometric exercise are contraindicated (Class
of recommendation IIa, Level of evidence B)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
57
Recommendation
Supplemental oxygen should be considered in PAH
patients with hypoxemia (Class of recommendation I)
Recommendation
Anticoagulation should be considered in IPAH patients
unless contraindicated (Class of recommendation II)
Recommendation
Digoxin can be considered in PAH patients with heart
failure with or without atrial fibrillation (Class of
recommendation IIb)
14.1 Pharmacological Therapy
14.1.1 Oxygen (Level of evidence C)
A small study demonstrated that supplemental oxygen improved long-term
survival in children with Eisenmenger syndrome53. For children with IPAH, it
may be recommended in patients who have nocturnal hypoxaemia, during
intercurrent respiratory infections or in the presence of severe right ventricular
failure.
14.1.2 Anticoagulation (Level of evidence C)
The use as well as the benefit of chronic anticoagulation in children with IPAH
is not well established. Thrombotic changes of the pulmonary microcirculation
have been seen in IPAH. Therefore, in the absent of contraindications, long
term warfarin therapy is recommended with the target INR between 2 to 3.5
14.1.3 Digoxin (Level of evidence C)
The value of digoxin is not proven in treatment of IPAH. However, it may be
useful in patient with atrial fibrillation and in PAH patients with heart failure
who remain symptomatic on medical therapy.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Recommendation
Diuretics should be given to PAH patients with right heart
failure (Class of recommendation I)
Recommendation
Only patients who demonstrate a positive vasoreactive
response should be treated with high dose CCBs (Class of
recommendation I)
14.1.4 Diuretics (Level of evidence C)
Diuretics therapy may be useful in patients with symptomatic right heart failure
(liver congestion, oedema). It must be used with caution as these patients are
preload-dependent.
14.1.5 Inotropes (Level of evidence C)
Short term intravenous inotropic support may be considered in patients with
decompensated right heart failure. (Class of recommendation IIa)
14.1.6 Calcium channel blockers (Level of evidence C)
While only a minority (20%) of adult patients with IPAH will respond to chronic
oral calcium channel blockade, a significantly greater percentage of children
are acute responders (40%) and can be effectively treated with calcium channel
blockers 128. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine and
amlodipine that act on vascular smooth muscle, are the preferred agents
whereas negative inotropic calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, should
be avoided 129. Children usually require higher dose (e.g. nifedipine 0.2 to 0.3
mg/kg/dose) but the optimal dose is still uncertain. They should be introduced
cautiously and the dose titrated as tolerated.
Non responders should not be given calcium channel blockers as it may worsen
clinical condition (systemic hypotension, pulmonary oedema, right ventricular
failure and death).
If the patients do not improve by achieving functional class I or II after on
several months of calcium channel blockers, they should be considered as nonresponders and other disease-targeted therapy should be instituted.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
59
14.2 PAH Specific Therapy
14.2.1 Prostanoids
14.2.1.1 Inhaled iloprost (Level of evidence B)
Inhaled iloprost 132 have all been used to treat children with PAH with varying
degrees of success. However, in practice, it can be difficult to deliver inhaled
iloprost effectively in young children every 2 to 3 hours daily.
14.2.2 Endothelin Receptor Antagonists
14.2.2.1 Bosentan (Level of evidence A)
Bosentan has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treatment of IPAH
in children 134-136. In BREATHE-3 study, the pharmacokinetics of bosentan in
pediatric patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and healthy adults are
similar, and treatment with bosentan resulted in hemodynamic improvement
134. It has been used for PAH associated with congenital heart disease and
connective tissue disease 135,136. Clinical improvement has also been observed
in patients as young as 9 months with severe disease 137,138.
Bosentan is indicated in stable WHO functional Class III and IV children with
IPAH. Recent data suggests early treatment with Bosentan could even be
beneficial for patients with functional Class II 70. The dosing regimens for
children are listed in Table 13. The most frequent adverse effect was flushing,
headache, and elevated liver enzymes. Liver function test should be monitored.
14.2.2.2 Ambrisentan (Level of evidence B)
Other endothelin receptor antagonist include Ambrisentan. However, there is
not enough evidence currently to support the routine usage in pediatric IPAH.
14.2.3 Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors
14.2.3.1 Sildenafil (Level of evidence A)
Sildenafil is reported to improve exercise capacity, decrease PAP, and improve
symptoms in adult and children with PAH. However, most studies in children
are limited to small series 139-52.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
1. Patients with symptomatic iPAH should be started on PAH
specific therapy. (Class of recommendation I)
2. PAH secondary to CTD or CHD can be considered for PAH
specific therapy (Class of recommendation IIa)
3. The choice of a PAH specific drug include an ERA, inhaled
Iloprost or a PDE5 inhibitor (Class of recommendation I)
The usual starting dose in 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg/dose 4 to 8 hourly. Dose should be
titrated up according to the response and the maximum dose is 2 mg/kg/dose
4 hourly. Doses beyond this have not shown any additional benefit. Headache,
flushing and hypotension are the most commonly reported adverse effects.
Route of administration, half-lives, dose ranges, increments and duration of

(refer to Section A, table 5, pg35)
14.3 Combination Therapy (Level of evidence B)
Combination therapy using different PAH-targeted drugs in patients exhibiting
clinical deterioration despite optimal targeted monotherapy has become
widely adopted. The use of combinations of drugs acting on distinctly different
pathways involved in the pathogenesis of PAH may maximize clinical benefit for
patients with PAH. All the studies on combination therapy are currently limited
to adult patients using various combinations of Bosentan with IV Epoprostenol
(BREATHE-2 study) 97, nebulized Iloprost with Bosentan 100 and Sildenafil with
Bosentan 103.
Meta-analysis included 21 trials revealed active treatments with any of the
disease-targeted drugs were associated with a reduction in all cause mortality
of 43% compared to placebo 96.

Children with pulmonary hypertension and recurrent syncope are unable to
maintain cardiac output by adequately shunting through the patent foramen
ovale. Atrial septostomy allows right-to-left shunt, decompresses the right
ventricle, increases systemic output and systemic oxygen delivery in spite of
a decrease in systemic arterial oxygen saturation. It resulted in a significant

and a trend toward improved survival 145-147
The indications for atrial septostomy are 148;149:
a.
Failure of maximal medical therapy with persisting RV failure and/or
recurrent syncope
b.
As a bridge to transplantation

Stepwise balloon dilatation is the procedure of choice. The interatrial orifice
is created by puncture with a Brockenbrough needle, then dilated using
progressively larger balloon catheters. A 10% drop in arterial oxygen saturation
or an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure to 18 mmHg should preclude further
dilatation. To minimize procedural related mortality, the recommendations
listed in Table 15 should be strictly adhered to150.

14.6 Transplantation (Level of evidence C)
For paediatric lung and heart/lung recipients, the data from the registry of the
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation demonstrates that
current survival is 65% at 2 yrs and 40% at 5 yrs 151.
It should be reserved for patients whose disease progressed despite optimal
medical therapy. Issues that should be taken into account are donor availability,
regional expertise and outcome, and waiting time.
15. Treatment Algorithm
The optimal therapy for patients with PAH is a highly individualised decision,
taking into account many factors including: drug availability, severity of illness,
route of administration, side effects, treatment goals, and clinician preference.
Figure 2 presents a proposed algorithm for the management of patients with
PAH.(refer to Section A, Figure 2, pg47)

HEART DISEASE
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
SECTION C
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Congenital Heart Diseases
16. Introduction
Many different congenital heart defects are associated with an increased risk
for the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. They can be classified
into 3 categories according to the pathophysiologic mechanisms:
a. High volume high pressure shunts: Large VSD, large PDA, complete
AVSD, aortopulmonary window, truncus arteriosus, transposition of
great arteries with large VSD
b. High volume low pressure shunts: Large ASD, total or partial
anomalous pulmonary venous drainage
c. High pulmonary venous pressure: Obstructed total anomalous
pulmonary venous drainage, cortriatrium, pulmonary vein stenosis,
supramitral ring
Initially these lesions cause reversible pulmonary hypertension. If left
untreated, progressively obliterative vasculopathy of the pulmonary arterial
tree eventually results in irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension. In
those with intracardiac shunts, reversal of flow (right to left shunt) across the
cardiac defects will result in cyanosis; a phenomenon known as Eisenmenger
syndrome.
Occasionally, progressive pulmonary arterial hypertension still develops
following initial successful closure of cardiac defects and these patients will
behave like idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).
17. Clinical Manifestations
In the Dana Point Classification of PAH 125, PAH associated with congenital
heart disease is classified together with IPAH and PAH associated with systemic
diseases. Despite significant similarities in the pulmonary vascular changes
between Eisenmenger syndrome and PAH due to other causes, there are
important differences which affect clinical presentation and outcome. The
important differences are listed in Table 16 152.

In patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, exercise limitation is present from
childhood and results in chronic adaptation of ‘normal’ everyday activities to a
lower intensity. Patients tend to underestimate the degree of exercise limitation
compared to objective measures of exercise tolerance 153.
Another major difference between patients with Eisenmenger and IPAH
is the presence and extent of cyanosis which is severe and occurs at rest in
Eisenmenger syndrome. Cyanosis and chronic hypoxia causes secondary
erythrocytosis. Iron deficiency is not uncommon and may cause hyperviscosity
symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, and paresthesias. Cyanosis
and chronic hypoxia also contributes to other systemic complications associated
with Eisenmenger syndrome such as nephropathy 154.

18. Assessment
The development of PAH in patients with CHD is very variable with some
developing irreversible pulmonary vascular obstructive disease early in life
while others with similar lesions remain operable even in the second decade
and beyond. Approximately 50% of patients with large VSDs and large PDAs
will develop Eisenmenger syndrome by early childhood whereas only 10% of
patients with large ASDs will develop it towards second or third decade of life.
This is in contrast to almost all the patients with unrepaired truncus arteriosus,
complete atrioventricular septal defect and transposition of great arteries with
large VSD will develop irreversible PAH by the end of 1st year.
The determination of whether a patient with CHD is still operable or has
irreversible PAH is difficult. The decision on surgical operability requires
an accurate determination of the degree of pulmonary vasoreactivity or
reversibility. This requires careful clinical assessment including:
a. History and clinical findings (presence of cyanosis, heart failure,
intensity of second heart sound and heart murmur)
b. Pulse oximetry
c. Chest X-ray (dilatation of central pulmonary artery, peripheral
pruning of pulmonary vasculature)
d. ECG (RVH, P pulmonale, right axis deviation)
e. Echocardiographic evaluation (chamber sizes and function, the
pressure gradient of shunt across the defect, tricuspid or pulmonary
regurgitation velocity)
f.
Exercise testing (6-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise test)
g. Invasive hemodynamic assessment (pulmonary artery pressure, Qp :
Qs ratio, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac output)
h. Vasodilator response to pharmacological agents. Acute vasodilator
testing during right heart catheterization using pharmacological
agents (e.g. inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled iloprost) have proven
to be useful in the preoperative evaluations, as well as in the treatment of
postoperative patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance *

•
Stage I - Medial hypertrophy (reversible)
•
Stage II - Cellular Intimal hyperplasia in an abnormally
muscular artery (reversible)
•
Stage III - Lumen occlusion from intimal hyperplasia of
fibroelastic tissue (partially reversible)
•
Stage IV - Arteriolar dilation and medial thinning
(irreversible)
•
Stage V - Plexiform lesion, which is an angiomatoid
formation (terminal and irreversible)
•
Stage VI - Fibrinoid/necrotizing arteritis (terminal and
irreversible)
However, it is rarely performed nowadays as it is invasive and has
limitations of sampling error and availability of histopathology
expertise.
* Intervention in patients with congenital heart disease associated with
pulmonary hypertension involves high morbidity and mortality and should be
performed in centers with experience managing these cases. To date, there
are no studies that have established the pressures, flows, and resistances
that define pulmonary reactivity and suitability for surgery in this group of
patients
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
71
19. Eisenmenger Syndrome
Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome may remain stable for many years 152;155
The main principle in the management of Eisenmenger patients is not to
destabilize the balanced physiology and risk reduction strategies.
19.1 General principle
19.1.1 General Advice
a.
Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome should AVOID the following:
•
Pregnancy
•
Dehydration
•
Moderate to severe strenuous exercise, particularly isometric
exercise
•
Acute exposure to excessive heat (e.g. Hot tub, sauna)
•
Chronic high-altitude exposure
•
Smoking
b. Air travel in commercial airlines is not discouraged in stable
Eisenmenger patients but care should be taken to avoid dehydration
and inactivity during the flight 156.
c.
All medications given to patients with Eisenmenger syndrome should
be scrutinized carefully to prevent potential alteration in the balanced
haemodynamic and adverse effects on renal and hepatic systems.
d. Long term oxygen therapy for at least 12 to 15h/day may improve
symptoms but has not been shown to influence survival 157;158.
20. Supportive Therapy
20.1 Hyperviscosity and Phlebotomy
Routine phlebotomy (venesection) is NOT recommended 159.
Secondary erythrocytosis is physiological desirable response to chronic hypoxia
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Recommendation
Routine phlebotomy (venesection) is NOT recommended
other than when indicated as above
Recommendation
Monitor iron profile and correct iron deficiency if present
in Eisenmenger syndrome. Inappropriate and repeated phlebotomy to maintain
a predetermined level of haematocrit can cause iron deficiency anaemia which
worsens hyperviscosity symptoms and predisposes the patient to stroke 160;161.
Indications for phlebotomy:
• Patients with moderate to severe hyperviscosity syndrome in the
absence of iron deficiency and dehydration 158;162
• Preoperatively before non-cardiac surgery to improve haemostasis 163
Method of phlebotomy 158;162
• Withdrawal of 10 ml/kg whole blood (250 to 500 ml in adults)
over 30 to 45 mins, preceded by or concurrent with volume
replacement (15 to 20 ml/kg isotonic saline)
• Blood pressure should be monitored before, during and after
procedure
• Not more than 2 to 3 phlebotomies should be performed in a year
20.2 Iron deficiency
Due to secondary erythrocytosis, sign of iron deficiency can be masked
clinically. Iron-deficient red blood cells have less oxygen-carrying capacity and
poor deformability that may lead to increased risk of strokes and vascular
complications. Serum iron profile (Hb, MCV, MCH, serum iron, ferritin, transferin
saturation) should be monitored at least annually or whenever indicated. If
present, it should be corrected with iron supplementation to replete body iron
store.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
73
20.3 Bleeding complications
Eisenmenger syndrome is associated with a paradoxical state of the increased
risk of thrombosis and bleeding diathesis 152. Haemoptysis is common and is the
main cause of death in 11 – 30% of patients 164. Thrombocytopenia is often seen
due to reduced platelet release from megakaryocytes, increased peripheral
consumption, thrombasthenia and decreased platelet life. Primary fibrinolysis
and coagulation factor deficiencies also contribute to high bleeding risk.
Anticoagulants and antiplatelets are generally avoided in Eisenmengers patients
due to increased risk of bleeding.
Accurate assessment of the coagulation parameters requires the amount
of sodium citrate in the coagulation test specimen tubes to be adjusted. In
patients with high haematocrit, the plasma volume is too low for the amount
of sodium citrate solution in the normal tubes and coagulation test results may
be falsely prolonged because of the excess anticoagulant in the plasma. The
formula to calculate the appropriate sodium citrate volume is: 165
Haemoptysis is common and major cause of death in Eisenmenger patients
although in most occasions, it is not severe and self-limiting.
The underlying causes of haemoptysis include pulmonary infarct from in-situ
thrombus formation at central pulmonary artery, rupture of aortopulmonary
collaterals, pulmonary infections, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. 164
Every hemoptysis episode should be regarded as potentially life threatening
and warrants meticulous evaluation, identification of underlying cause and
appropriate management (Table 18).158

20.4 Thrombosis and Thromboembolic Complications
Prevalence of pulmonary artery thrombosis in Eisenmenger syndrome
is estimated to be 20% 164. Risk factors are increasing age, biventricular
dysfunction, degree of the pulmonary artery dilatation, female sex and lower
systemic arterial saturation.
Patients with cyanotic congenital heart diseases are also at increased risk of
stroke (13.6%) 160. Atrial fibrillation, systemic hypertension and iron deficiency
are among the risk factors.
However, the role of long term anticoagulation in Eisenmenger patients is
controversial because of the risk of bleeding and difficulty in controlling
INR within targeted range in cyanotic patients. Therefore, the indication for
anticoagulation should be individualized and limited to specific indications 166
•
Atrial flutter and fibrillation
•
Recurrent thromboembolic events
•
Mechanical heart valve
Using air filter in all intravenous line may prevent paradoxical air embolism
and reduce risk of stroke.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
75
Recommendation
Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have a higher risk of bleeding
Avoid routine anticoagulation unless risk of thromboembolism
outweigh risk of bleeding
20.5 Arrhythmias & Heart Failure
Supraventricular arrhythmias (atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation) and occasionally
ventricular arrhythmias are significant cause of morbidity and mortality 167.
Unfortunately, pharmacological treatment of arrhythmias in Eisenmenger
patients is limited by haemodynamic side effects and must be used with
caution.
Sudden death is common mode of death in Eisenmenger patients 155. It is
precipitated by arrhythmias, massive haemoptysis and cerebrovascular events.
Right heart failure is a potential complication of Eisenmenger syndrome. Role
of digoxin is controversial 168. Diuretics may be indicated to relieve symptoms of
congestion but care must be taken to avoid dehydration which may precipitate
hyperviscosity and hypotension 158.
20.6 Perioperative Management of Non-cardiac Surgery
Any non-cardiac surgery can be potentially life threatening in Eisenmenger
patients (perioperative mortality as high as 19%) 169. They are very vulnerable
to alteration in haemodynamics induced by anaesthesia and surgery 170
• Drop in systemic vascular resistance increases right-to-left shunting
and possibly cardiovascular collapse
• Bleeding diasthesis
• Thromboembolic complications
• Arrhythmias
Any non-essential surgery should be avoided if possible. When surgery is
necessary, it should preferably be performed in centers with expertise in
managing these patients.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Recommendation
Measures to reduce peri-operative risk should be taken during
non cardiac surgery for patients with ES
Risk reduction strategies include
• Close monitoring during and post-procedure; ideally in intensive care unit
• Avoid hypovolaemia and dehydration; prolonged fasting should be avoided
• Systemic hypotension should be treated aggressively
• Avoid iron deficiency anaemia
• Meticulous attention to haemostasis; excessive bleeding should
be treated promptly
• Preoperative phlebotomy if indicated to improve haemostasis
• Meticulous attention to intravenous lines to prevent paradoxical air
embolism (use intravenous filters if available)
• Endocarditis prophylaxis
• Avoid prolonged post-operative immobilization; precaution should be
taken against deep vein thrombosis
20.7 Nephropathy, Hyperuricaemia and Rheumatological Complications
Increased blood viscosity can lead to renal hypoperfusion with progressive
glomerulosclerosis. Renal dysfunction involves proteinuria and hyperuricaemia
171. Hyperuricaemia has been shown to be an independent poor prognostic
marker for patients with Eisenmenger syndrome 172. Renal profile and serum
uric acid level should be measured regularly. Nephrotoxic drugs should be
avoided.
Rheumatological complications include gout secondary to hyperuricaemia and
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Gouty arthritis can be treated with colchicines
or oral corticosteroid. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be
avoided.
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
77
20.8 Infections
•
Intercurrent infections must be treated aggressively
•
Immunization against influenza and pneumococcal disease is
recommended
•
Antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis prior to dental/
surgical procedures is mandatory
20.9 Pregnancy and Contraception
PREGNANCY IS ABSOLUTELY CONTRAINDICATED
Pregnancy carries high maternal and fetal mortality 173;174. Mothers may
be particularly at risk in the first few days after delivery. All patients and
their partners should be counseled regarding avoidance of pregnancy and
appropriate contraception.
Women with Eisenmenger syndrome who become pregnant should 175
•
Undergo termination of pregnancy as early as possible. Termination in
the first trimester is a safer option
•
Termination of Pregnancy in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters poses a high risk
to the mother. The risks of termination should be balanced against
the risks of continuation of the pregnancy
•
If a patient chooses to continue with the pregnancy, she should be
managed by a multidisciplinary team (obstetricians, cardiologist,
anaesthetist and intensivist) with expertise in managing patients with
pulmonary hypertension)
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES: MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH)
Recommendation
Pregnancy is contraindicated and should be avoided with
appropriate contraception
20.9.1 Contraception
•
Contraception counseling is strongly advised and the method of
contraception should be discussed with the obstetrician
•
Tubal ligation carries some operative risk and endoscopic technique
is a preferred method
•
Use of single-barrier contraception alone is not recommended
because of high failure rate
•
Oestrogen-containing contraceptives increase risk of
thromboembolism and should be avoided Progesterone-only
preparations may be considered
•
Intrauterine device carries high risk of infection
20.10 Specific Disease Targeted Treatment
There is evidence to suggest that the current available therapies for IPAH may
have some beneficial effect in patients with Eisenmengers syndrome. However
caution is required when using vasodilators as this may cause reduction in
systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure which increases the right to
left shunting and hypoxaemia.
The use of these specific disease targeted therapy in Eisenmenger patients
should be limited to centers with experience managing these patients.
Bosentan Randomised Trial of Endothelin Antagonist Therapy-5 (BREATHE-5)
is the only large randomised double blind placebo trial conducted in patients
with Eisenmenger syndrome 72. Bosentan had a beneficial short term effect on
exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary haemodynamics. The beneficial effects
on exercise capacity were maintained up to 40 weeks in open label extension
study (BREATHE-5 OLE) 176.
A small randomised trial on Sildenafil (10 Eisenmenger patients) showed
improvement in functional status, exercise capacity and pulmonary arterial

pressure 177. Other non-randomised observation studies have also reported
beneficial effects of advanced therapy in this group of patients 178;179.
Similarly, data on prostanoid therapy in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome are
limited to case reports and small series. Continuous intravenous epoprostenol
was reported to improve functional class, oxygen saturation, exercise capacity
and decrease pulmonary vascular resistance 180.
20.11 Transplantation
Lung transplantation with repair of the underlying cardiac lesion or heart
and lung transplantation can be performed as the last option for patients
with Eisenmenger syndrome. It improves symptoms and quality of life 181;182.
However, it is currently not practical due to shortage of organs. The current
5-year survival rate following transplantation is only 45% 183. Most Eisenmenger
patients tend to have better survival prospect without transplantation (10-year
survival between 58% and 80%) 158;184.
Hopkins et al 185 described an actuarial survival in patients with Eisenmenger
syndrome who did not receive transplantation of 97%, 89%, and 77% at 1, 2,
and 3 years, respectively, compared with 77%, 69%, and 35% at 1, 2, and 3
years for patients with IPAH.

Barriers and facilitators in implementing the guidelines
Access to PAH specific drugs can limit implementation of treatment strategies.
Dissemination of information and educating medical personnel on PAH can aid
in earlier detection and treatment of patients with PAH.
Training, financial support
Specialised centres for management of PAH should be established and expertise
developed. Medical personnel can then receive appropriate training in these
centres.
Since the cost of the PAH specific drugs are expensive, public funding of therapy
would be necessary.
Conclusions
As new therapies have been developed for PAH, screening, prompt diagnosis,
and accurate assessment of disease severity have become increasingly
important. However, the diagnosis and treatment of PAH is often complex,
and it is clear that patients benefit from referral to a centre that specialises in
the treatment of this disorder.141 In this review, we have proposed a treatment
algorithm based on the evidence available. However, in clinical practice we
recognise that the choice of drug is dependent on a variety of factors, including
approval status, route of administration, side effect profile, patient preference,
and the physician’s experience and clinical judgment.
Moving forward, several unresolved questions remain. Firstly, none of the
currently available therapies is curative, so the search for new treatment
strategies continues. As we increase our understanding of specific disease
pathways involved with PAH, there remains the possibility of developing targeted
therapies that will further improve outcomes. Secondly, there remains a need
to identify patients with PAH earlier, before the onset of extensive vascular
remodeling. New tools and diagnostic techniques will be essential to deriving
maximal benefit from our expanding therapeutic armamentarium. Finally,
the transfer of this information from bench to bedside requires collaborative
research. Accordingly, patients and physicians should be encouraged to foster
such research by participating in RCTs conducted at specialised PHT centres.
