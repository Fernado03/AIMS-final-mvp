GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The Development Group for these Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG)
consisted of Orthodontists, Paediatric Dental Specialist, Oral &
Maxillofacial Surgeon, Restorative Dental Specialist, Dental Public
Health Specialists and Dental Officer. The Review Committee was
actively involved in the development process of these guidelines.
The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Unerupted Maxillary
Incisor (August 2006) was used as the basis for the development of
this CPG. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition.
In addition to the general text and photographic updates, new and
updated information has been included in the management such as the
use of Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), updates in surgical
and restorative components, key messages and recommendations.
In addition, clinical audit indicators have also been identified for the
purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.
As part of the reviewing process, new evidences were retrieved
from publications from year 2006 to June 2015. Literature search
was carried out using the following electronic databases: PUBMED/
MEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); ISI
Web of Knowledge; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and full
text journal articles via OVID search engine. The reference lists of
all relevant articles retrieved were also searched to identify further
studies. Free text terms or MeSH terms were used either singly or in
combination to retrieve the articles (Appendix 1). Only literature in
English was retrieved.
There were 14 clinical questions assigned to members of the
development group. The group members met a total of seven times
throughout the development of this CPG. Literature retrieved were
appraised by at least two members and presented in the form of
evidence table and discussed during group meetings. All statements
and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the
development group and review committee. This CPG is based largely
on scientific evidences and adapted according to local practices.
However, where there was a lack of evidence, recommendations were
based on consensus of group members. Although, ideally patients’
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
views and preferences need to be considered in the development
of CPGs, in this instance, it was not feasible. Nevertheless, patient
information leaflets would be developed to facilitate the dissemination
of important information to the public.
The levels of evidence of the literature were graded using the modified
version from the United States (U.S) / Canadian Preventive Services
Task Force, while the grading of recommendations was based on the
modified version of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network
(SIGN).
The draft guidelines were evaluated by a team of reviewers and were also
posted on the Ministry of Health, Malaysia and Academy of Medicine,
Malaysia websites for comments and feedbacks. This guideline was
presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, and finally
to the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and CPG Council, Ministry
of Health, Malaysia for approval.

INTRODUCTION
Unerupted or clinically missing maxillary incisors can have a major
impact on dental and facial aesthetics of an individual. As missing
upper incisors are regarded as unattractive, this may have an effect on
the self-esteem and social well-being of the individual. Some speech
difficulties associated with missing upper incisors have been reported.
1, level III Thus, it is important to detect and manage the problem as early as
possible to achieve a functioning dentition and a pleasing appearance.
Early diagnosis is essential for a successful outcome and reduces the
necessity for appliance therapy in some cases.
1.1 Definition
The maxillary incisor is considered unerupted when:
a) there is no history of previous extraction,
b) eruption of contralateral incisor has occurred 6 months earlier
2-4, level III or if both central incisors are unerupted and the lower incisors
have erupted more than one year previously, or 4, level III
c) there is deviation from the normal sequence of eruption such as
lateral incisors erupt before the central incisors. 3-4, level III
1.2 Aetiology
The possible causes of maxillary incisors failing to erupt include:
a)
Congenital
Unerupted incisors may be considered part of a spectrum of
inheritable dental anomalies. 5, level III
• Presence of supernumerary tooth (Figure 1) is a common
cause of failure of eruption.
6, level II-3 42% to 62% of
midline supernumeraries are associated with unerupted
permanent incisors.7-10, level II-3 Maxillary incisor that fails
to erupt due to the presence of a supernumerary tooth has a
better prognosis than those with other aetiology. 6, level II-3
• Ectopic development such as severe malposition and/or
impaction against another tooth may inhibit the permanent
incisor from erupting. 11, level III
• Other pathologies such as cysts and odontomes may also
prevent eruption of the permanent incisor. 6, level II-3; 12, level III
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
• Generalised delay or failure of eruption are associated
with certain conditions such as cleidocranial dysostosis,
gingival fibromatosis and some clefts lip and palate. 13, level III
b)
Environmental
• Retained deciduous teeth. 9, level II-3; 14, level III
• Dilaceration of the permanent maxillary incisor resulted from
trauma to the deciduous predecessor (22%) and the remaining
were probably developmental in origin (71%). 15, level II-3
• Ankylosis, where the root of the maxillary incisor becomes
fused to the alveolar bone. 16, level III
• Dense mucoperiosteum can occur during development or due
to the formation of scar tissue following surgery. 16, level III
• Thickened or enlarged follicles around the unerupted incisor
crown. 17, level II-1
1.3 Prevalence
The prevalence of unerupted maxillary incisors in the 5-12 year age
group has been reported as 0.13%.18, level II-3 In a referred population
to regional hospitals the prevalence has been estimated at 2.6%.
8, level II-2 Unerupted incisors are more common in males than females
with a ratio of 2.7:1. 5, level III Almost half (47%) of all unerupted maxillary
incisors are due to supernumeraries. 6, level II-3 The mesiodont variety has
more eruptive disturbances compared to the palatodont. 8, level II-2

2. DIAGNOSIS
2.1 Dental and Medical History
A detailed dental and medical history should be obtained to determine
possible aetiology, which may cause delayed eruption. Medical and
dental history should include:
• Family medical history (any syndromic tendencies)
• History of trauma and extraction
2.2 Examination and Diagnosis
Early clinical examination with radiographic investigation at age of 6-8
years can detect presence of unerupted maxillary incisors, 3, level III which
would allow early interception and monitoring and thus may improve
treatment outcome.
2.2.1 Clinical Examination
An intra-oral examination should be conducted for the presence of the
following:
• Retained deciduous teeth (Figure 2)
• Buccal or palatal swelling
• Availability of space for the incisor (about 9 mm for a central
incisor and about 7 mm for lateral incisors) 19, level III

Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
2.2.2 Radiographic Investigations
The following radiographs may aid in the diagnosis and management:
• An anterior occlusal radiograph for general assessment
purposes 20, level III
• Two periapical radiographs should be taken using the parallax
technique for detailed assessment of the position, root and
crown morphology. 21-22, level III It has been shown that the
use of horizontal parallax technique is better than vertical
parallax in localization of impacted canines 23, level II-3
• If an anterior occlusal and a panoramic radiograph are already
available, the vertical parallax can also be used for assessment
20, level III
2.2.3 Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)
In recent years CBCT has been introduced as a technique for imaging
of dental and maxillofacial structures. 24, level III CBCT is a medical image
acquisition technique based on a cone-shaped X-ray beam centred on
a two-dimensional (2D) detector. The source-detector system performs
one rotation around the object producing a series of 2D images. The
images are reconstructed in a three-dimensional (3D) data set using a
modification of the original cone-beam algorithm. 25, level III
CBCT imaging provides orthodontists with an excellent tool to improve
diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome assessment in appropriate
malocclusion cases. 26, level III Studies have shown that CBCT is more
sensitive than conventional radiography for both impacted teeth
localization and identification of root resorption of adjacent teeth.
27, level II-3 The comprehensive images in three planes provided by CBCT
can assist surgeons in choosing the appropriate surgical approach,
identifying the tooth that should be extracted, and reducing the
amount of surgical trauma on the adjacent hard and soft tissues.28, level III
Exposure levels of the CBCT systems falls between medical CT and
conventional radiography. Selection of the most appropriate imaging
modality should be decided in view of the delivered doses, required
image quality and information and the clinical circumstances. 29-30, level
III CBCT should only be used when the clinical question cannot be
answered by conventional radiography and the field of view should
be limited to the region of interest. 31, level III Example of CBCT images
showing an unerupted maxillary left central incisor as in Figure 3.

• Clinical examination and conventional radiographs are
the first line in diagnosing unerupted maxillary incisor.
• CBCT can be used in selected cases in which conventional
radiography

provide
sufficient
diagnostic
information.
3. PREVENTIVE AND EARLY INTERCEPTIVE MEASURES
Most eruptive anomalies can be prevented with proper timing and
early diagnosis at ages 6 to 8 years. 3, level III; 32, level II-1 The earlier the
removal of the causative factor the better is the prognosis. Therefore,
it is recommended that teeth that have not erupted 6 months after
normal eruption time should be investigated radiographically. 33, level II-3
Any retained deciduous teeth should be removed if the incisor is close
to eruption. 4, level III When space is created for eruption, 75% will erupt
spontaneously; out of which 55% will align spontaneously. 17, level II-1; 33,
level II-3
Obstructions should be removed as early as possible when sufficient
space is available for eruption. The earlier the obstruction is removed,
the better the prognosis. 34, level III Where the obstruction is caused
by the presence of supernumerary teeth, 54% to 74% will erupt
spontaneously within 16 months provided sufficient space is available.
36, level II-2; 35, 37, level II-3 Removal of the supernumerary will aid in the path of
eruption of permanent tooth. 38, level II-3
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
4.
MANAGEMENT
4.1 Create and Maintain Sufficient Space
The availability of space to accommodate the impacted tooth is
prerequisite in the management of unerupted incisors. 17, level II-1; 39, 40, level
III; 35, 41, level II-3
Adequate space (at least 9 mm for the central incisor and 7 mm for the
lateral incisor) should be created prior to any surgical intervention to
enhance spontaneous eruption. Almost half of the impacted incisors
erupt spontaneously following the removal of obstruction and creation
of space. 42, level II-3; 43, level II-1
Maintenance of the space throughout the treatment is crucial to prevent
lost of space which can lead to secondary inhibition of spontaneous
eruption of the impacted tooth. 38, level II-3
4.2 Remove Physical Obstruction
• Retained deciduous tooth
The retained deciduous tooth should be extracted to allow the
permanent incisor to erupt. Approximately 0.2% of retained
deciduous roots and 0.3% of retained deciduous teeth have
been found to obstruct eruption of permanent incisors. 9, level II-3
Recommendation 1:
Early removal of obstructions and creation of space would facilitate
spontaneous eruption of unerupted tooth. (Grade B)
Recommendation 2:
Sufficient arch space has to be created and maintained for the
eruption of permanent maxillary incisor. (Grade B)
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
• Soft tissue
Thickened or enlarged follicles around the unerupted incisor
crown and hyperplastic/scar tissue are potential barriers
to eruption.17, level II-1 The soft tissue barrier should be treated
with an uncovering procedure that includes crown exposure.
44, level III Removal of the fibrous tissue overlying the crown will
result in rapid eruption in most cases.17, level II-1
• Supernumerary/odontome
The presence of a supernumerary tooth or odontome does not
necessarily cause delayed eruption of incisors. 8, 46, level II-3;
40,
level
III;
45,
level
II-2
However,
observation
with
regular
radiographic controls is advisable to detect any pathological
changes. 9, 10, level II-3; 45, level II-2
• Cyst / pathological lesion
The incidence rate of dentigerous cyst affecting the permanent
incisor is approximately 1.5%.47, level III A conservative approach
is preferred in the management of unerupted incisor associated
with cyst in children in order to preserve the tooth. As children
have greater bone regenerative potential and tooth with
incomplete root development maintain the eruptive strength,
marsupialization or decompression technique is the treatment
of choice.
48, level III The cyst cavity will be filled with
new bone while the tooth is allowed to erupt spontaneously
or orthodontically brought into position. 49, level III Apart from
being
an
atraumatic
and
less
invasive
procedure,
marsupialization can also prevent psychological and mental
trauma in children. 50, level III
About 50% to 78% of impacted maxillary incisors will erupt
spontaneously following removal of the supernumerary and full
eruption occurs within 1.5 – 3.0 years. 35, 37-38, 41, 46, level II-3; 36, level II-2; 40, 51, level III
The earlier the removal of the causative factors, the better the prognosis
for alignment of the incisor, although the optimal time for surgical
removal of supernumerary teeth is controversial. 33, 38, 46, level II-3; 40, 52, level III
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
Almost three-quarters of incisors with incomplete root development
erupt spontaneously after removal of the associated supernumerary
teeth. More than half of the incisors with complete root development
required further operation. These incisors should be exposed with or
without bonding at the time of removal of the supernumerary teeth.
41, level II-3
4.3
Surgical Treatment for Failed Eruption
After removal of physical obstructions, the unerupted incisor should
be observed for about 12-18 months for spontaneous eruption.
4, level III If the incisor fails to erupt with no obvious obstruction the
following surgical intervention can be considered:
a) Exposure with/without orthodontic traction
b) Removal of the impacted incisor
It was found that 87% immature roots were present in children less than
10 years old compared to only 27% in those above 11 years old. About
72% of unerupted incisors with immature roots erupted spontaneously
following extraction of supernumerary while 63% of those with mature
roots required further surgical treatment. 41, level II-3 Therefore, it may be
prudent to expose the unerupted incisor with mature root, with/without
bonding and orthodontic traction of the tooth at the time of extraction
of the supernumerary. 41, level II-3
Attachment of bracket and gold chain (Figure 4) placed at same
time as surgical procedure to remove the obstruction may benefit
the unerupted maxillary incisors with near complete apical formation.
7, 41, level II-3
Spontaneous eruption of impacted tooth occurred in almost half of
the cases after removal of the supernumerary of which the majority
erupted within 18 months.
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
Figure 4: Orthodontic traction with gold chain (Photo credit: Roslili Mat)
However, maturity of the impacted tooth and the developmental stage
of the incisors were found not to affect the treatment time when surgical
removal of any obstruction and traction initiation in combination with
orthodontic space creation and final alignment were practised. 53, level II-2
Surgical exposure should also be done if there is lack of eruptive
movement due to either an enlarged follicle or scar tissue acting as a
barrier. 17, level II-1 The exposure should aim to provide a functional width
of attached gingiva on the labial surface in order to prevent the muscles
of the face from detaching the marginal periodontal tissue from the
tooth, causing marginal bone loss and gingival recession.54, level II-3
4.3.1 Surgical Techniques
There are various surgical techniques to uncover the unerupted teeth.
Two basic approaches are open and closed eruption techniques.
4.3.1.1 Open Eruption Technique
The impacted tooth is left exposed to the oral environment following
surgery and surrounded by the incised palatal or labial mucosa.
An attachment may be placed during or after the procedure. This
technique is termed open eruption technique or exposure and can be
performed in two ways:
a) The window technique
This direct technique involves removal of the overlying mucosa
and the exposed tooth will have a non-keratinized labial
gingival mucosa.
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
b) The apically repositioned flap
The procedure involves apically repositioning the raised flap
that incorporates attached gingiva overlying the impacted
tooth and is expected to provide adequate width of attached
gingiva.
4.3.1.2 Closed Eruption Technique
The closed eruption technique has been favoured by many clinicians
who claimed that the aesthetic and periodontal outcome is far more
superior when compared with the apically positioned flap. 55, level II-2
With this method, a labial or palatal flap is raised and an attachment
with gold chain or a bracket/eyelet with ligature wire is bonded to the
enamel surface of the tooth using acid-etch technique, preferably
with a light cured adhesive, before the flap is replaced (Figure 5).
Orthodontic traction is then applied. 56-59, level III
4.3.2 Open versus Closed Eruption Technique
There are a few criteria to evaluate when considering the best method
for uncovering unerupted tooth. 60-61, level III
•
Labio-palatal Position of the Unerupted Tooth
For labially positioned tooth any technique is possible. However,
if the unerupted tooth is in the centre of the alveolus, it may be
difficult to approach by the two open eruption techniques
(window and apically position flap). A simple window technique
may be preferred if the impacted tooth is low down in the alveolus
and bucco lingually close to its place in the arch.
For palatally positioned tooth where there is presence of thick
palatal mucosa tissue the window technique usually requires
Figure 5:

attachment

Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor

placement of a periodontal pack to prevent regrowth of tissue
over the exposed tooth.
•
Vertical position of the unerupted tooth relative to the
mucogingival junction
If the crown of the unerupted tooth is positioned coronal to
mucogingival junction any one of the three techniques can be
used to uncover the tooth. If it is positioned apical to the
mucogingival junction, the window technique may not be
appropriate and the apically position technique is appropriate.
To uncover the tooth that is significantly apical to the mucogingival
junction, a close eruption technique is preferred.
•
The amount of gingiva in the area of the unerupted tooth
In the presence of insufficient gingiva in the area of the unerupted
tooth, an apically positioned flap is preferred. 2 - 3 mm of attached
gingiva over the crown of the tooth allows any of the three
technique to be used.
•
The mesio-distal position of the crown of the tooth
If the central incisor is positioned over the root of the lateral incisor
it would be difficult to move the tooth through the alveolus, unless
completely exposed with apically positioned flap. The close
eruption
or
excisional
uncovering
generally
is
not
recommended.
4.3.3 Effect on Eruption
A study showed that to facilitate eruption, 41% of the unerupted incisor
teeth required surgical exposure while 59% required surgical exposure
with bonding of an orthodontic attachment for traction. Hence, an
attachment placed at the same time as surgical procedure to remove
the supernumerary may benefit the non-erupted maxillary incisors with
near complete apical root formation. This may prevent the patient from
having to undergo a second surgical procedure. 7, level II-3; 39, level III
There may be a risk that the tooth may still fail to erupt following
surgical exposure. A study on impacted canine shows that the rate of
ankylosis following open surgical exposure technique was 3.5% and
14.5% in the closed technique.62, level II-1 However, there is no such study
available involving unerupted maxillary incisors.
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
4.3.4 Effect on Periodontal Tissue
The long term unfavourable aesthetic and periodontal effects on the
treated unerupted incisors has been noted following open eruption
technique. The technique has been associated with significant
increase in crown length, reduction in the width of the attached
gingiva, increased in pocket depth, abnormal gingival contour and
gingival scarring. 55, level II-2; 63, level II-1 The apically positioned flap is a
valid and effective technique that facilitates long term maintenance
of the periodontal health. However, aesthetics may be compromised
by the visible scar and longer clinical crown. 63, level II-1 A modified
apically repositioned flap has been used in the treatment of unerupted
maxillary central incisors by incorporation of palatal mucosa resulting
in successful establishment of an attached gingival margin. 65, level III In
addition, the close eruption technique showed less width of attached
gingiva on the distal surface and increased probing bone level. 55, level
II-2 Both open and closed exposure methods have their place and will
produce acceptable outcomes when appropriately selected. 61, level III
A well-planned multidisciplinary approach will ensure a successful
treatment outcome.
Recommendation 3:
Placement of orthodontic attachment at the same time as the
surgical exposure may prevent a second surgical procedure.

4.4 Dilacerated Incisor
In early developmental stages, the permanent tooth germ of the
maxillary incisor is situated palatally and superiorly to the apex of the
primary incisor. The tooth germ gradually changes direction in a labial
direction with its crown moving closer to the resorbing primary root.
Due to the close relationship between the permanent tooth germ and
the apex of the primary incisor, it is believed that an acute trauma to
the primary predecessor can cause dilaceration of the developing
root along the vertical axis of the permanent successor (Figure 6).
Clinically, dilaceration can be felt by palpating high in the labial sulcus
or in the hard palate. 66, level III

Dilaceration of maxillary central incisor: a literature review. Dental Traumatology 2010; 26: 427–433.
It has been reported that dilacerations of central incisors following
trauma to deciduous predecessors usually require extraction.
Congenital displacement or idiopathic aetiology usually has more
favourable prognosis for orthodontic alignment. 67-68, level III The
dilacerated incisor may be brought into the line of the arch depending
on the degree of deformity. 68-70, level III Such tooth may require root filling
and/ or apicectomy.
The treatment of dilacerated tooth should commence early, to provide
the opportunity for the non-calcified root to change direction and
develop a proper spatial relationship with the already calcified formed
crown. 71, level III Following surgical exposure with the closed-eruption
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
technique and appropriate orthodontic traction, the tooth may be
aligned into the dental arch and the crown-root angulation can be
improved and continue developing. To this end, an inter-disciplinary
approach is considered necessary to ensure an optimal outcome.
72, level III
If the dilaceration is severe or the incisor is ankylosed with poor
prognosis for alignment, the permanent incisor may be removed. In this
case the options of space opening and maintenance or space closure
have to be decided carefully prior to extraction. Adequate space should
be maintained initially with a fixed or removable prosthesis. 73-75, level III
4.5 Ankylosis
Ankylosis can occur in both deciduous and permanent dentition.
Trauma in deciduous incisors resulted in 4.9% of the deciduous
incisors to be ankylosed. 76, level II-2 This can cause obstruction to the
erupting permanent incisor. In ankylosed primary incisors, extraction of
the ankylosed tooth and observation for the eruption of its successor,
space creation and/or maintenance is advised. Space maintenance
can be carried out by making a series of transitional prosthesis.
77-78, level III In ankylosed permanent tooth, extraction and prosthetic
replacement or surgical luxation with forced eruption of the tooth
is advised. 49, 78-79, level III Distraction osteogenesis of an ankylosed
permanent maxillary incisor with subsequent orthodontic adjustment
has been reported. 78, level III
4.6 Removal of Unerupted Incisor
If an unerupted permanent incisor with a poor prognosis has to be
removed, the options are either to open or close the missing incisor
space.
4.6.1
Open Space or Close Space Decision
Generalized spacing in the arch indicates that space opening for a
subsequent prosthesis will usually be more appropriate than space
Treatment should start as early as possible, to minimize the severity
of a developing dilacerated tooth.
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor

closure. Conversely where crowding is present, space closure is
preferable. 80, level III In the deciduous or mixed dentition stage, the
retained deciduous tooth should be maintained as long as possible
to preserve alveolar bone for a potential implant-retained crown.
Composite resin can be added to maintain the mesial, distal and incisal
dimensions. However, if extraction of the contralateral deciduous tooth
is indicated, both deciduous maxillary should ideally be removed to
maintain arch symmetry. This also allows mesial eruption of canines
into the incisor positions for future space closure.
4.6.2
Close Space with Orthodontic Treatment
In the case of space closure, the adjacent teeth should be approximated
and modified to mimic the missing incisor. This technique has
an advantage of removing the need for prosthetic replacements.
73-74, 81-82, level III
Restorative reshaping or ‘remorphologization’ can be carried out
before, during or after the orthodontic treatment. Enamel reduction,
composite build-up, veneer placement or combinations based on pretreatment canine shape will be required in order to achieve optimal
aesthetics. Darker shade of canines was found to be the major cause
of dissatisfaction. 83-84, level III Any colour difference in composite build-up
can be reduced using vital bleaching. Removal of excessive anterior
guidance at palatal canine should be considered with due attention
given to the large palatal pulp horn in children. 80, level III
In a retrospective study, 93% of space closure group were very or
moderately satisfied with appearance compared with 65% in the
prosthetic replacement group. 84, level III The former group was also
significantly more satisfied with the appearance of their teeth compared
with their friends, than subjects in the latter group. Altogether, 40%
were dissatisfied with the symmetry of the upper incisor segment due
to differences in shape and colour of the teeth next to the central incisor
and worse result noted in unilaterally missing incisor. No implants
however were used as prosthetic replacements.
4.6.3
Restore Space with Autotransplantation
Autotransplantation of developing premolars into the extracted incisor
region provides an alternative approach in some clinical situations
(especially in young patients and presence of crowding in the dental
arch).
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
The best outcome is obtained when the donor tooth root development
has reached one-half to three-quarters of the final root length, although
a favourable outcome has also been reported in tooth with complete
root development. 85-86, level II-2
Autotransplantation has the advantages of inducing bone formation
and reestablishment of normal alveolar process. This treatment option
may be considered as a temporary measure in young patient in order
to maintain the volume of alveolar bone ridge. 87, level III; 88, level II-2
Impairment in root growth, pulp obliteration and root resorption are the
common complications that clinicians should be aware of. 89-90, level II-1
4.6.4
Restore Space with Dental Prosthesis
The space may be restored with a fixed or removable prosthesis.
Modifications to adjacent teeth and attention to the marginal gingiva
will enhance aesthetics 74-75, 82, 91, Level III
a)
Adhesive bridges
‘Maryland’ type bridges which were reported with 60% ten-year
survival rate, are minimally invasive. They are therefore popular
for intermediate and definitive restorations for missing lateral
incisors. However, lack of crown height can result in insufficient
surface for bonding, lack of room for framework connectors, as
well as metal ‘show-through’ at the incisal one-third of abutments.
As a result, surgical crown lengthening may be necessary.
80, level III Patient should be aware that, when an adhesive bridge
debonds following orthodontic treatment, space loss can be
surprisingly rapid. 80, level III
b)
Conventional full-preparation bridgework
This is usually reserved for patients where the abutment teeth are
heavily restored or when they are indicated for crown coverage.
c)
Removable chrome partial denture
This offers an affordable interim or even reversible semi-definitive
replacement whilst waiting for definitive restorative work. Whilst
the acrylic component may aesthetically and functionally replace
and/or mask supporting tissue defect, the rigid alloy framework
may offer stabilisation of the arch following orthodontic treatment
and thus, may allow re-establishment of occlusal stability. 92, level III
Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor
2015
d)
Restore space with implant
An implant (Figure 7) may be considered for adolescents
provided that dental and skeletal maturation is complete or
almost complete. 93, level II-2 Good survival rates, aesthetics, safety,
efficacy and highly predictable results with different implant
systems provided strict protocols and case selection is adhered
to. 94, level III; 95-96, level II-2 Infraocclusion of the implant-supported crown
may occur due to slight continuous eruption of the adjacent teeth
post-adolescent. This is especially so in unilateral maxillary lateral
incisor implants. Bilateral implants have less aesthetic problems.
9, level II-3 Implant treatment can be complicated by a lack of
interocclusal space for the implant superstructure (usually at
least 7mm). Inadequate clearance may necessitate soft or hard
crestal tissue to be removed, although ideally the opposing
teeth should be orthodontically intruded beforehand. 80, level III The
coronal mesio-distal restorative space required is determined
from the diagnostic wax up or from the presence of contralateral
tooth or space. These factors should be taken into account at the
treatment planning stage.

incisor (Photo credit: Kamarul Hisham Kamarudin)
•
Restorative treatment options depends on either to open or
close the missing incisor space.
•
Retained deciduous tooth should preferably be maintained
to preserve alveolar bone until definitive restorative work is
decided.

5.
CONCLUSION
Unerupted maxillary incisors should be identified early and managed
accordingly based on a comprehensive clinical examination and
radiographic investigation. Depending on the position and prognosis of
the tooth, appropriate treatment plan with multidisciplinary involvement
should be carried out.
6.
IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the
management of unerupted maxillary incisors in Malaysia.
Limiting Factors in Implementation
Potential limiting factors in the implementation of CPG are as follows:
a)
Poor understanding/limited knowledge on unerupted maxillary
incisor among patients/caregivers and healthcare providers
b)
Insufficient resources, lack of expertise in the management of
unerupted maxillary incisor and diagnostic tools
c)
Variation in treatment practice and preferences
d)
Lack of coordinated referral and follow-up system
Methods to Facilitate Implementation
It is hoped that implementation of the CPG recommendations would
be effective through:
a)
dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers
b)
regular update for healthcare providers
Potential Resource Implications
There should be a strong commitment to:
a)
ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare providers
b)
initiate training of healthcare providers ensuring information is up-
to-date
c)
allocate adequate funding to ensure the effective implementation
of the CPG recommendations
Successful treatment outcome depends on early detection and
multidisciplinary approach.
