STATEMENT OF INTENT
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are meant to be guides for
clinical practice, based on the best available evidence at the time of
development. Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily
guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is
responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the
clinical picture presented by the patient and the management options
available locally.
UPDATING THE CPG
These guidelines were issued in 2020 and will be reviewed in a minimum
period of four years (2024) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When
it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of
the related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done
on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A
multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review
methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken
to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of
publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections
will be published in the web version of this document, which is the
definitive version at all times. This version can be found on the websites
mentioned above.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations were highlighted by the CPG
Development Group as the key clinical recommendations that should
be recognised for implementation.
Diagnosis and Notification
• Children suspected of dengue infection should be tested with a
combination of NS1 Antigen/IgM/IgG rapid test (dengue rapid combo
test).
 Rapid test of NS1 Antigen alone may be used on day 1 to day 5
of illness.
• Notification should be done for all suspected dengue cases from
private and public health facilities by telephone/fax/e-notification to
the nearest health office within 24 hours of diagnosis. This should be
followed by written notification using the standard notification form.
Treatment
• All children with dengue infection who are treated as outpatient:
 should have daily clinical and laboratory monitoring until resolution
of critical phase
 should be provided with dengue monitoring card and dengue
home care leaflet
• Isotonic crystalloid solutions should be used in resuscitation and
maintenance therapy in children with dengue.
 Colloid solutions may be used in persistent shock despite
resuscitation with crystalloid solutions.
• Close monitoring and frequent reassessment should be done to
guide appropriate fluid management of children with dengue shock.
 They should be managed by senior staff in hospitals with
paediatricians.
 Those with prolonged and/or decompensated shock should be
admitted to the high-dependency or intensive care unit.
• Blood transfusion should be given in life-threatening conditions and
given as soon as severe bleeding is recognised (overt) or suspected
(occult) in children with dengue.
 It must be given cautiously to avoid fluid overload especially in
neonates or infants.
• Dengue infection in infants should be managed in a hospital with
paediatric services.

FORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION
In line with new development in CPG methodology, the CPG Unit of
MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) in its work process. The
quality of each retrieved evidence and its effect size are carefully
assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group. In formulating
the recommendations, overall balances of the following aspects are
considered in determining the strength of the recommendations:-
• overall quality of evidence
• balance of benefits versus harms
• values and preferences
• resource implications
• equity, feasibility and acceptability
ii
Level
I
II-1
II-2
II-3
III
Study design
Evidence from at least one properly randomised controlled trial
Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without
randomisation
Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control
analytic studies, preferably from more than one centre or
group
Evidence from multiple time series with or without intervention;
dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the
results of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s)
could also be regarded as this type of evidence
Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience;
descriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert
committees

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The members of the Development Group (DG) for these CPG were
from the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Education (MoE).
There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee
during the process of the CPG development.
A systematic literature search was carried out using the following
electronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Embase.
Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion
criteria are all children with suspected and confirmed dengue infection
regardless of study design. The first search was limited to literature
published in the last 14 years (2004 - 2018) and on humans specifically
children with unspecified age and in English. In addition, the reference
lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts
in the field contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were
conducted from 30 October 2018 to 7 November 2018. Literature
search was repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG
development process allowing any relevant papers published before
7 February 2020 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider
evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search
strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.
References were also made to other guidelines on dengue in children
as listed below:
• Paediatric Protocols for Malaysian Hospitals (Fourth Edition)
• Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue
• Dengue Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and
Control
A total of 12 main clinical questions were developed under different
sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions
within these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions.
The DG members met 14 times throughout the development of these
guidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG
members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented
in evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All
statements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed
upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the
recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any
differences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based
largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical
trials, with local practices taken into consideration.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/
Canadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)
while the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of
GRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows
strictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and
Evaluation (AGREE II).
On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers.
It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback
from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to
the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology
Assessment (HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review
and approval. Details on the CPG development by MaHTAS can be
obtained from Manual on Development and Implementation of
Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015
(available at http://www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/CPG_MANUAL_
MAHTAS.pdf?mid=634)

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Epidemiology
Dengue fever (DF) is a common and serious mosquito-borne viral
disease. It is caused by dengue virus (DENV) which has four serotypes
(DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). All serotypes are found in Malaysia
and the predominant serotype changes from year to year.
The vector for DENV is a mosquito from the genus Aedes which has a
biting preference for certain times of the day i.e. the morning and late
afternoon. A. aegypti is considered as the principal species as it only
feeds on humans and can adapt to cohabit with humans in both urban
and rural environments. A. albopictus on the other hand is less efficient
to spread DENV since it feeds on both human and animal blood.
The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in
recent decades. The actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported
and many are misclassified. World Health Organization reports a
modelling estimate of 390 million dengue infections per year (95% CI
284 to 528), with 96 million (95% CI 67 to 136) manifesting clinically
(with any severity of the disease).1, level III
In Malaysia, the number of dengue cases and incidence rate (IR)
continues to increase with the highest number ever reported in 2019.
In that year, a total of 130,101 dengue cases were reported which was
equivalent to an IR of 390.4 cases per 100,000 population.
During the period 2000 - 2019, the annual number of dengue cases
in Malaysia varied substantially, from the lowest value of 7,103 cases
(30/100,000 population) in 2000 and reaching a peak of 120,836
cases (390/100,000 population) in 2015. After the peak, there was a
downward trend in 2016, 2017, 2018 with yearly reduction of 16.1%,
17.3% and 3.9% of cases respectively. However, in 2019, there was an
increase of 61.4% in dengue cases. Refer to Figure 1.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)

Figure 1. Annual number and incidence rate of dengue in
Malaysia, 2000 - 2019
Source: Analysis of dengue cases in Malaysia. Disease Control Division, Ministry of
Health Malaysia. 2020 (unpublished document).
DENV affects all age groups worldwide. Thus, children are also not
spared from dengue infection and their management proves to be
challenging. It has been estimated by World Health Organization
(WHO) that 500,000 people with severe dengue require hospitalisation
each year, a large proportion of whom are children.2 - 3, level III
In the majority of children (0 - 12 years old), dengue causes flu-like
illness which might be difficult to differentiate from other febrile illness
(OFI) and seldom causes death. The severe form that leads to plasma
leakage and shock is the cause of death among children in some Asian
and Latin America countries.3, level III In Malaysia, the annual percentage
of cases among children has increased from 2014 to the current
percentage of about 20% in 2019 (refer to Figure 2).

1.2 Classification
Dengue classification has undergone major changes since 2009. The
previous 1997 classification of DF and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
drew much criticisms since the case definition of DHF was too rigid
and not applicable in primary care or resource-limited settings. Another
issue was that the old case definition failed to identify a significant
proportion of dengue cases that were severe in nature involving certain
target organs. Severe manifestations e.g. central nervous system
(encephalopathy) and hepatic failure were not included in the old
definition. The emphasis of the old classification was more on bleeding
manifestations, hence the nomenclature of DF and DHF were used.
Findings from a multicentre study by DENCO study group led to the
new clinical classification.4, level II-2; 5, level III Malaysia has adopted these
new classifications for use in clinical management and clinical audit of
mortality cases. New terms like dengue with/without warning signs and
severe dengue are used to emphasise that not only bleeding causes
problems in dengue but increased vascular permeability leading to
plasma leakage can tip an in individual over to a severe form of dengue.

1.3 Severity
Dengue infection may be asymptomatic or present with a broad range
of clinical manifestations from [mild febrile illness (known as DF) to lifethreatening shock syndrome]. Numerous viral, host and vector factors
are thought to impact the risk of infection and disease severity.
There are four closely related but serologically distinct DENV types.
Generally, infection with one DENV serotype confers protection to
infection with that serotype only. Thus, individuals are susceptible to
secondary infections with other serotypes. They are at greater risk
of severe dengue. Therefore, children and adults living in dengue
endemic area like Malaysia where all serotypes co-circulate are at risk
for primary/secondary infections with any DENV.6 - 8, level III
Dengue infection in children is often difficult to differentiate from OFI
hence often delaying appropriate management in a timely manner.
Children generally present with non-specific clinical features of OFI.6, level III
Among the different paediatric age groups, infants are at high-risk of
getting severe dengue. The age specific incidence of infant DHF is
0.5/1000 person between the ages of 3 to 8 months in South East Asia.
Infants with primary infection may develop severe dengue when the
mothers have prior DENV immunity.9, level III
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)

2. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Dengue in children has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations
ranging from non-severe to life-threatening. Refer to Figure 3 for
common symptoms and signs of the condition.
Dengue illness begins abruptly after an incubation period of 4 - 10 days
following the mosquito bite. It encompasses three phases as discussed
below.
a. Febrile phase
This phase usually lasts 2 - 7 days. Common features include:
• abrupt high-grade fever
• facial flushing, skin erythema, generalised body ache, myalgia,
arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, photophobia, rubelliform exanthema
and headache
• anorexia, nausea and vomiting
These features are also present in OFI which might be difficult to
differentiate from DF. Refer to Table 2.
The earliest abnormality in full blood count (FBC) is a gradual drop in
white cell counts, which should alert the doctor to a high probability
of dengue. Haematological manifestations are mild e.g. petechiae,
mucosal membrane bleeding (nose, gum), easy bruising or bleeding at
venepuncture sites.10, level III
Complications e.g. dehydration and febrile seizures may occur during
this phase.
b. Critical phase
This phase usually begins after the third (or earlier) day of illness but can
be as late as day eight of illness. It typically occurs around the time of
defervescence (temperature drops to and remains below 38ºC. Plasma
leakage may occur as a result of increased capillary permeability and
is manifested by warning signs (refer to yellow box below). This set of
clinical parameters usually precedes manifestations of shock.10, level III
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
6
Warning signs of dengue
• Abdominal pain - abdominal tenderness and continuous pain (not
intermittent)11, level III
• Persistent vomiting - ≥2 episodes of vomiting that amounts to fatigue
or requires intravenous (IV) fluids12, level II-3
• Mucosal bleed - bleeding from nose, gums, conjunctiva, vagina,
gastrointestinal/ respiratory/urinary tract11, level III
• Lethargy, restlessness10, level III
• Liver enlargement >2 cm10, level III
• Clinical fluid accumulation - pleural effusion and ascites11, level III
• Laboratory: increase in haematocrit (HCT) concurrent with decrease
in platelet - HCT raised by 20% from the baseline value with concurrent
decrease in platelet count ≤100 x 103 cells/mm10 - 11, level III
*Refer to Table 6 on Range of Haematocrit in Different Age Groups.
Significant critical phase usually lasts 24 - 48 hours, mostly worse
around defervescence. Some children may enter this phase before
defervescence. The initiation of plasma leakage is signalled by an
elevated HCT and rapid onset of thrombocytopenia or warning signs.
The HCT level is closely associated with loss of plasma volume and the
higher the level of haemoconcentration, the greater the severity of the
disease.13, level III However, majority of children recover spontaneously or
after a short period of fluid therapy.
Continuous vascular permeability and plasma leakage give rise to
hypovolaemia and shock. Severe plasma leakage leads to dengue
shock syndrome (DSS). Severe organ involvement may develop e.g.
severe hepatitis, encephalitis and myocarditis, and/or severe bleeding
even without obvious plasma leakage or shock.
• Pathophysiology of plasma leakage and shock in dengue
Increased capillary permeability is the main pathophysiological
abnormality seen in dengue infection which results in plasma leakage into
the extravascular compartment.3, level III This results in haemoconcentration
and hypovolaemia or shock. Shock in dengue is a physiological
continuum, from asymptomatic capillary leakage to compensated shock,
then hypotensive shock and eventually cardiac arrest.10, level III The
mechanisms that lead to severe dengue are not well established.
During earlier stage of shock, the body compensates to maintain normal
systolic blood pressure (BP). Hypovolaemia leads to reflex tachycardia
and widespread vasoconstriction due to increased sympathetic activity.
Refer to Appendix 3 on Systemic Manifestation of Peripheral
Vasoconstriction.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)

Parameters to be monitored during haemodynamic assessment are
shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Haemodynamic Assessment: Continuum of
Haemodynamic Changes
*unless the child is touched, parameters of shock will be missed e.g. cold extremities,
weak peripheral pulses, prolonged CRT
Modified: World Health Organization. Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue.
Geneva: WHO; 2012
c. Recovery phase
Most cases of severe dengue will enter the convalescent phase
24 - 48 hours after the onset of plasma leakage. This is followed by
gradual reabsorption of extravascular compartment in the next 48 - 72
hours.10, level III
Improvement of patient’s general condition is shown by gradual return
of appetite, disappearance of gastrointestinal symptoms, stabilisation of
haemodynamic status and commencement of diuresis. Some patients
may develop a confluent erythematous or petechial rash with small
areas of normal skin over the extremities described as “isles of white in
the sea of red”.10, level III

• In recovery phase, important signs to be considered are:
 general condition improves
 HCT may decrease due to dilutional effect which does not warrant
further action
 new onset respiratory distress due to fluid overload
During recovery phase, cardiac manifestations may include bradycardia
and hypertension.10, level III; 14 The HCT normalises or decreases due to
the dilutional effect of reabsorbed fluid. Soon after defervescence, there
is an increase of white blood cell (WBC) count followed by recovery of
platelet count.10, level III

3. DIAGNOSIS
3.1 Clinical Diagnosis
Accurate diagnosis of dengue is essential for early detection and
management of severe dengue, and timely institution of preventive
measures. High index of suspicion is important in arriving at the
diagnosis e.g. history of recent fogging in locality, recent family history
of dengue, etc. Definitive diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation.
• The criteria for a provisional diagnosis of dengue infection are as
below:10, level III
 Live in/travel to dengue endemic area
 Fever and TWO of the following
- nausea or vomiting
- leukopenia
- rash
- any warning signs
- aches and pains
These criteria are well outlined in dengue classification (Figure 3).
Features associated with laboratory-confirmed dengue in children are
nausea or vomiting, absence of upper respiratory infection symptoms,
liver enlargement, thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000 /µL) and
leukopenia (leukocyte count <4000 /µL).15, level III
Differential diagnosis for dengue in children is shown in Table 2.

3.2 Laboratory Diagnosis
Since the clinical symptoms for dengue viral infection in children are so
diverse, accurate clinical diagnosis is challenging. Virus detection and
serological conversion had been the main targets for diagnosis for many
years. Now, point-of-care diagnostic tests like dengue combo rapid test
can be used in conjunction with assessment of clinical presentation to
arrive at the diagnosis. Difficulty in diagnosis is further confounded by
appearance of different biomarkers at different phases of dengue and
their persistence also depends on whether it is primary or secondary
dengue (refer to Figure 6). Therefore, if the first test done to confirm
the diagnosis of dengue is negative but there is still clinical suspicion
of dengue, the diagnostic test needs to be repeated. The choice of test
depends on the timeline from onset of symptoms to presentation (refer
to Algorithm 1).
Dengue infection can be diagnosed by
• detection of the dengue virus protein by non-structural protein 1
antigen (NS1 Ag) - rapid test/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA)
• antibody detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G
(IgG) (serology) - rapid test/ELISA
• combination of NS1 Ag with IgM/IgG rapid test (dengue rapid
combo test)
• genome detection - real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
• virus isolation
NS1 Ag test has a high specificity for dengue infection (86 - 99%) but
with lower sensitivity (67% - 71%).16 - 17, level III
Dengue rapid test is a good tool for detection of DENV IgM in acute
dengue infection (AUC=0.91).18, level II-2
Combination of NS1 Ag with an IgM/IgG rapid test in acute dengue
infection results in an increased sensitivity to:19, level III
• 89% for combination of NS1 Ag with anti-IgM
• 93% for combination of NS1 Ag, anti-IgM and anti-IgG
Refer to Figure 6, Table 3 and Table 4 on appropriate test to be done
during different phases of dengue infection.

In primary infection (top panel), both NS1 and virus can be detected
from the onset (day 1) of disease, with IgM appearing around day
3 of illness and IgG appearing towards the end of the acute period.
Secondary infections (bottom panel) are characterised by the presence
of IgG early in the acute phase of disease and a shorter duration of
NS1 and virus detection. Note the onset of severe dengue (DHF/DSS),
primarily in secondary infections and at a time when virus and NS1
levels are falling.20, level III

Refer to Algorithm 1 on Dengue Laboratory Diagnosis.
All laboratory results should be interpreted by taking into consideration
the clinical features and timing of test.
In local setting, for severe dengue or mortality cases, serotyping should
be sent to reference laboratory.
Recommendation 1
• Children suspected of dengue infection should be tested with a
combination of NS1 Antigen/IgM/IgG rapid test (dengue rapid combo
test).
 Rapid test of NS1 Antigen alone may be used on day 1 to day 5
of illness.
• Laboratory results should be correlated with clinical presentation of
children suspected of dengue.
• Dengue serotyping should be done for severe dengue or mortality
cases in children.
3.3 Post-Mortem Cases
Tissue samples of suspected dengue infection from post-mortem cases
should be sent for viral isolation and PCR. Tissue samples of choice
are from the liver, spleen and lymph nodes.10, level III The tissues should
be placed in sterile containers and moistened with sterile normal saline
(NS). Bone marrow samples should be collected in ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube. In patients suspected of having dengue
encephalitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples should be submitted in
sterile bijou bottles. These samples should be transported on ice to the
referral laboratory. All samples should be refrigerated if there is delay
in transportation.21
Recommendation 2
• Tissue samples of suspected dengue infection from post-mortem
cases should be sent for viral isolation and polymerase chain reaction
test.
3.4 Notification
• Under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act, 1988
(Act 342), notification of dengue is mandatory and failure to notify is
compoundable.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
14
Any delay in notification will increase the risk of dengue transmission
in the locality of the residence. Any change in diagnosis or severity
should be re-notified. All dengue deaths need to be notified as soon
as possible by the treating doctor in the hospital to the district health
office and/or State Health Department and must be investigated by the
District Health Officer or Epidemiology Officer.
Health authorities will investigate all notified cases for the verification of
case definition and preventive measures. Ministry of Health Malaysia
has set up new criteria since 2014 whereby all registered dengue cases
must be laboratory confirmed.22
Recommendation 3
• Notification should be done for all suspected dengue cases from
private and public health facilities by telephone/fax/e-notification to
the nearest health office within 24 hours of diagnosis. Except for
e-notification, other types of notification should be followed by written
notification using the standard notification form.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)

4. RISK FACTORS FOR SEVERE DENGUE
Risk factors for severe dengue need to be identified to improve dengue
management in children. WHO listed seven warning signs in 2009
guidelines. However, recent study shows that the signs listed below are
significantly associated with severe dengue:23, level II-2
• lethargy
• abdominal pain
• bleeding tendencies
• hepatomegaly
• haemoconcentration of >22% of baseline
• thrombocytopenia of <100,000 /µL
Other predictors of dengue severity in children are:
• demographic: female sex, age group >5 years old,23, level II-2
obesity23 - 24, level II-2
• epidemiology: secondary infection by DENV, infection by
DENV-223, level II-2
• clinical signs: pulse pressure <20 mmHg, systolic BP <90 mmHg
23, level II-2
• laboratory parameters: WBC >5,000 /μL, haemoglobin (Hb) <9 g/
dL,23, level II-2 prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT), low fibrinogen level25, level Ill
• imaging: gallbladder wall thickening >5 mm23, level II-2 presence of
pleural effusion, ascites and/or gallbladder wall thickening25, level Ill
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)

5. TREATMENT
5.1 Febrile Phase
Children may present with acute febrile illnesses which may be difficult
to differentiate from dengue infection at the initial stage. During the first
encounter, appropriate history taking and physical examination should
be performed to arrive at the correct diagnosis. For paramedics who
attend the child before a doctor, use the Checklist for Initial Assessment
Dengue in Children for Paramedics to avoid missing the diagnosis
(refer to Appendix 4).
For children who do not require admission, advice should be given on
temperature and fluid management (refer to Appendix 5).
• Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for the treatment of
fever and pain. The dose in dengue needs to be adjusted since there
is theoretical risk of liver injury. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg/
dose, not more than 3 - 4 times in 24 hours in children.10, level III
• Perform tepid sponging if the patient still has a high fever.10, level III
• Do not prescribe acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), ibuprofen or other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) or intramuscular
injections, as these aggravate gastritis or bleeding.10, level III
5.1.1 Outpatient monitoring and treatment
Outpatient monitoring is recommended for children with dengue
infection who do not require admission and they are as listed below:
10, level III
• daily vital signs monitoring i.e. temperature, pulse rate/volume, BP
and CRT
• daily FBC monitoring specifically HCT and platelet count. Initial
HCT can be used as a baseline during the monitoring. Critical phase
of plasma leakage is preceded by decreasing WBC count, platelet
count and increasing HCT. Thus, daily FBC is recommended until
the critical phase has resolved.
• daily fluid intake and urine output. Caregivers should be advised to
record oral fluid intake and urine output. Urine output of 4 - 6 times/
day signifies adequate fluid intake.
• advise caregivers to bring the child for reassessment by healthcare
providers if the child’s condition worsens i.e. presence of warning
signs.
Children with dengue infection who are managed as outpatient should
be provided with dengue monitoring card and dengue home care leaflet
(refer to Algorithm 2 and Appendix 5).
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
17
Recommendation 4
• All children with dengue infection who are treated as outpatient:
 should have daily clinical and laboratory monitoring until resolution
of critical phase
 should be provided with dengue monitoring card and dengue
home care leaflet
5.1.2 Admission criteria
Most children with dengue infection are asymptomatic. Those with
symptoms will generally recover with/without symptomatic treatment.
However, approximately 5% of cases will develop severe dengue
and require admission.26, level III Refer to Chapter 2 on Clinical
Manifestations and Pathophysiology and Chapter 4 on Risk
Factors for Severe Dengue.
• The admission criteria for children with dengue infection include:
10, level III
 age <12 months
 presence of warning signs
 features of severe dengue
 presence of co-morbidities
• Admission may be considered based on social factors e.g. difficulty
for outpatient monitoring.
Positive NS1 Ag test only is not an indication for admission as majority
of non-severe dengue (65.9%) are NS1 Ag positive.27, level III Serological
evidence of dengue does not indicate the child needs admission since
dengue IgM positivity (93%) is more common in non-severe dengue.
28, level III
Healthcare providers should use his/her clinical acumen to stabilise
patients prior to transfer to appropriate healthcare facilities. Adequate
communication to the receiving facility must be made. Refer to
Garispanduan Rujukan dan Perpindahan Pesakit di Antara Hospitalhospital Kementerian Kesihatan.29
5.1.3 Inpatient monitoring
As the child progresses through the course of dengue infection,
appropriate monitoring is recommended to enable early detection of
severe illness. Clinical and laboratory parameters that may predict
progression are:30 - 31, level III
• clinical - increased central to peripheral temperature gradient,
bleeding episodes, hepatomegaly, pulse pressure <20 mmHg,
systolic BP <90 mmHg
• laboratory - white cell count >5,000 /μL, platelet ≤100,000 /μL, high
serum lactate and decreasing base excess
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
18
Dynamic prediction model that incorporates signs, symptoms and
daily laboratory measurements improves DSS prediction (AUC=0.70).
32, level II-3 On the other hand, Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
that includes HCT, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), urinary protein,
creatinine and platelet count has a moderate accuracy (64.1%) for
predicting the development of severe dengue among children with
confirmed DENV infection.33, level III
Frequency of monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters will
depend on severity and phase of illness (refer to Table 5).3, level III
Documentation of the findings from the monitoring should be done
using the Inpatient Dengue Monitoring Chart (refer to Appendix 6).
• Rapid haemodynamic assessment can be performed at bedside
using C (skin colour), C (CRT), T (extremities’ temperature), V (pulse
volume) and R (pulse rate).

5.2 Critical Phase
The three main priorities of managing hospitalised patients with dengue
in critical phase are:
• replacement of plasma losses
• early recognition and treatment of haemorrhage
• prevention of fluid overload
Judicious IV fluid therapy is essential and usually is the only intervention
required to maintain effective circulation for 24 - 48 hours during the
critical phase.10, level III For overweight or obese patients, the ideal body
weight should be used for calculating fluid infusion rates (refer to
Appendix 7).
Fluid resuscitation must be clearly separated from fluid maintenance.
Fluid resuscitation of 10 - 20 ml/kg fluid boluses are administered for a
limited period of time under close supervision. This rapid fluid boluses

to reverse shock is followed by titrated fluid volume to match ongoing
losses. Haemodynamic state should be used as a main driver of IV fluid
therapy and not HCT alone.
• Goals of fluid resuscitation are to:
 improve circulation as evidenced by decreasing tachycardia,
improving BP and pulse volume, warm and pink extremities and
CRT <2 seconds
 improve end-organ perfusion as evidenced by improving
consciousness level and urine output
 achieve appropriate decrease in HCT (refer to Subchapter 5.2.6
on Interpretation of HCT)
Patients with severe dengue who are in critical phase require emergency
treatment and urgent referral to a hospital with paediatrician and access
to blood transfusion facilities (refer to Figure 3 for Criteria of Severe
Dengue). All patients in shock should have their blood sample taken
and cross-matched carried out.
• Criteria for pediatric intensive care unit/high dependency unit referral
Dengue patients should be referred to paediatric intensive care
units/high dependency unit in the event of life-threatening situation
characterised by one or a combination of the following:10, level III
• prolonged and/or decompensated shock
• severe
bleeding
with
severe
disseminated
intravascular
coagulopathy
• fluid overload
• respiratory distress and failure
• severe organ impairment (hepatic damage, renal impairment,
cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy or encephalitis)
5.2.1 Choice of resuscitation fluid
Most children with dengue in shock respond well to judicious treatment
with isotonic crystalloid solutions.34, level III; 35, level I These fluids should not
contain glucose.10, level III Isotonic crystalloid solutions should be used
for maintenance therapy.10, level III; 36, level I Early intervention with colloidal
solutions is not indicated.35, level I This is supported by a Cochrane
systematic review that included children with DSS which showed no
evidence that resuscitation with colloids reduced the risk of death
compared with crystalloids.37, level I
In the case of persistent shock despite resuscitation with crystalloid
solutions, colloid solutions can be considered.14 Clinicians should use
colloid solutions based on their personal experience, familiarity with
particular products, local availability and costs involved.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
21
Colloid solutions have been advocated for fluid resuscitation in
severe dengue for both adults and children. Among the colloids used,
hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is the most controversial. In a randomised
controlled trial on children with dengue, minor advantages in initial
recovery were shown with HES while significantly more allergic
adverse reactions were associated with dextran.35, level I However,
a recent systematic review of paediatric population with shock of
various aetiology showed concern on safety issues with HES used
for resuscitation. They included increased creatinine level, decreased
platelet count and increased length of intensive care unit stay. Thus,
HES was not recommended for paediatric patients.38, level I
Recommendation 5
• Isotonic crystalloid solutions should be used in resuscitation and
maintenance therapy in children with dengue.
 Colloid solutions may be used in persistent shock despite
resuscitation with the crystalloid solutions.
5.2.2 Treatment of warning signs
In children with dengue presenting with warning signs or signs of
dehydration (refer to Appendix 8), judicious volume replacement with
IV fluid therapy from this early stage may modify the course and severity
of disease. Refer to Algorithm 3.
5.2.3 Treatment of compensated shock
Treatment plan for patients with compensated shock is as follows (refer
to Algorithm 4):10, level III Obtain a reference HCT before starting IV fluid
therapy.
• Secure IV/intraosseous (IO) access within five minutes.
• Start IV fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid solutions at 10 -
20 ml/kg over one hour.
• Reassess the patient’s condition (vital signs, CRT, HCT and urine
output).
• If the condition of the patient improves, reduce IV fluid accordingly.
• If oral fluid intake improves, IV fluid can be reduced earlier.
• Stop IV fluid if patient shows signs of reabsorption, usually 48
hours after entering critical phase.
• If vital signs are still unstable (i.e. shock persists), check HCT
urgently after the first fluid bolus.
• If the HCT increases or still high with evidence of shock, repeat
crystalloid solution at 10 - 20 ml/kg over an hour.
• Consider changing to colloid solution at 10 - 20 ml/kg over an hour
after resuscitation with 40 ml/kg of crystalloid solution.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
22
• Decreasing HCT with unstable vital signs indicates bleeding which
may be occult. Transfuse patient with fresh whole blood or packed
cells.
• Boluses of crystalloid or colloid solution may need to be repeated
if shock recurs.
Children with compensated shock should be closely monitored in
hospitals with paediatricians and managed by senior staffs.
5.2.4 Treatment of decompensated (hypotensive) shock
All dengue children with decompensated shock should be managed
more vigorously. The treatment plan is as mentioned in treatment of
shock earlier except the following:10, level III
• Secure IV access within five minutes.
• Initiate IV fluid resuscitation with crystalloid solution at 20 ml/kg as
a bolus over 15 - 30 minutes for quick shock reversal.
• Colloid solution may be considered if the BP has to be restored
urgently, i.e. in those with pulse pressure <10 mmHg. It has
been shown to reduce the level of HCT faster than crystalloids in
intractable shock, however the effect is transient.35, level I
• Monitor vital signs closely and urine output hourly with an indwelling
catheter.
• Children with decompensated shock should be admitted to the
high-dependency or intensive care area and managed by senior
staffs.
Refer to Algorithm 5.
Recommendation 6
• Close monitoring and frequent reassessment should be done to
guide appropriate fluid management of children with dengue shock.
 They should be managed by senior staffs in hospitals with
paediatricians.
 Those with prolonged and/or decompensated shock should be
admitted to the high-dependency or intensive care unit.
5.2.5 Monitoring of dengue patients in shock
Patients with dengue shock should be monitored frequently until the
critical phase is over. Parameters to be monitored include:10, level III
• consciousness level
• vital signs
• peripheral perfusion (every 15 - 30 minutes until the patient is out of
shock, then 1 - 2 hourly)
• continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry monitoring
is advisable in unstable patients
Refer to Table 5 for the frequency of monitoring in critical phase.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
23
• The higher the fluid infusion rate, the more frequent the patient
should be monitored and reviewed in order to avoid fluid overload
while ensuring adequate volume replacement.10, level III
• In local setting, children with shock should at least have continuous
ECG and pulse oximetry monitoring. IV fluid should be administered
using infusion/syringe pumps.
A detailed fluid balance of all inputs and outputs should be maintained.
Urine output should be checked regularly (each hour until the patient is
out of shock, then every 1 - 2 hours). A continuous bladder catheter is
essential in close monitoring of urine output. An acceptable urine output
would be at least 0.5 - 1 ml/kg/hour. Input/output ratio should not be
used as sole determinant in fluid resuscitation as input is typically much
greater than output during critical phase.10, level III
If previously not detectable, pleural effusion and ascites are usually
detectable after fluid boluses. Monitoring with bedside ultrasonography
may be used if available. More importantly, monitor their effects on
breathing and assess the need of respiratory support.10, level III
If blood gas machine is available, HCT, lactate and acidosis level should
be repeatedly analysed using capillary or venous blood to monitor
changes in the circulation. HCT should be monitored before and after
fluid boluses until stable, then 4 - 6 hourly.10, level III
An arterial line has certain advantages but its placement can be
hazardous because of the risk of bleeding from failed attempts. The
advantage of an arterial line is that in profound and persistent/recurrent
shock states, it allows for continuous and accurate BP measurements
and frequent blood sampling. If arterial line insertion is attempted, it
should be done in critical care setting.10, level III
In addition, patients with severe dengue should be monitored for:
10, level III
• blood glucose (before fluid resuscitation and repeat as indicated)
• other organ functions (e.g. renal, liver and coagulation profiles)
before resuscitation and as indicated
5.2.6 Interpretation of haematocrit
• Baseline HCT on the first three days of illness is a useful reference
point. The rise of HCT level beyond 20% of the baseline during
critical phase indicates significant plasma leakage and the need for
IV fluid therapy.10, level III
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
24
It is important to note that during fluid therapy, HCT level should be
taken pre- and post-fluid resuscitation or when there are changes in the
fluid infusion rate.
• HCT alone is not the driver for fluid therapy. The interpretation of
HCT will be most meaningful if the corresponding haemodynamic
state and response to fluid therapy are known at the time of blood
sampling.10, level III
 A rising or persistently high HCT with unstable vital signs indicates
active plasma leakage and the need for a further bolus of fluid
resuscitation.
 A rising or persistently high HCT in patients with stable vital
signs and adequate urine output does not require extra IV fluid.
Continue to monitor closely and usually the HCT will start to fall
within the next 24 - 48 hours as plasma leakage stops.
 A decrease in HCT with signs of shock may indicate major occult
haemorrhage and urgent transfusion with fresh packed red cells/
fresh whole blood is needed. Occult bleeding may take several
hours to become apparent and the patient’s HCT will continue to
decrease without achieving haemodynamic stability.
 A decrease in HCT with stable vital signs and adequate urine
output, indicates haemodilution or reabsorption of extravasated
fluids. This signifies the start of recovery phase and IV fluids must
be discontinued immediately to avoid pulmonary oedema.
The following table shows the normal range of HCT in different age
groups.

Hyperglycaemia:10, level III
• is the result of a neuroendocrine stress response, occurs in
diabetes mellitus and results from inappropriate large quantities of
glucose-fluids administered in resuscitation
• causes osmotic diuresis which worsens the hypovolaemic shock
and gives a false impression of a “good urine output”
• is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality in
critically ill paediatric patients; most cases of hyperglycaemia will
resolve with appropriate (isotonic, non-glucose) and adequate
fluid resuscitation
However, if hyperglycaemia persists, undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or
impaired glucose tolerance should be considered and IV insulin therapy
initiated. Subcutaneous insulin should be avoided in shock state as
absorption is unreliable.
Hypoglycaemia:
• occurs due to starvation in young children, diabetic patients on
hypoglycaemic agents and severe liver impairment
• may cause seizures, mental confusion and increased sympathetic
drive
• should be treated as an emergency with a bolus of 2 ml/kg of
dextrose 10%
Frequent glucose monitoring should be carried out and euglycemia
maintained with glucose-isotonic solution [NS dextrose 5% running at
maintenance rate according to Holliday Segar formula (refer to Table
7)] and enteral feeding if possible.10, level III; 36, level I This maintenance fluid
should be included as part of fluid therapy according to the Algorithm
2, 3 and 4.

If oral intake is still inadequate, blood glucose should be monitored
frequently during the critical and recovery phase.
5.2.8 Electrolytes and acid-base imbalances
Hyponatraemia is a common observation in severe dengue but the
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. It could be related to
gastrointestinal losses through vomiting and diarrhoea or the use of

hypotonic solutions for resuscitation and correction of dehydration. The
use of isotonic solutions for fluid resuscitation and maintenance will
prevent and correct this condition.10, level III
Hyperkalaemia:
• is observed in association with severe metabolic acidosis or acute
kidney injury (AKI). Appropriate fluid resuscitation will reverse the
metabolic acidosis and associated hyperkalaemia
• in life-threatening situation, hyperkalaemia should be managed
with infusions of calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate and/
or insulin-dextrose. Potassium binder e.g. sodium polystyrene
sulfonate and beta agonist are useful adjunctive treatment. Refer
to Malaysian Paediatric Protocol Fourth Edition (page 34)39, level III
• in failed medical treatment, renal replacement therapy (RRT)
should be considered if patient’s haemodynamic status is stable
Hypokalaemia:
• is often associated with gastrointestinal fluid losses and stressinduced hypercortisol state
• usually happens towards the later part of the critical phase
• should be corrected with potassium supplements in the IV fluids
Serum calcium levels should be monitored in critically ill patients.
Hypocalcaemia is common following large amount of blood transfusion
and should be corrected.
5.2.9 Metabolic acidosis
Compensated metabolic acidosis is an early sign of hypovolaemia and
shock. Lactic acidosis due to tissue hypoxia and hypoperfusion is the
most common cause of metabolic acidosis in critically ill dengue patients.
Correction of shock and adequate fluid replacement will reverse the
metabolic acidosis. If metabolic acidosis remains uncorrected by this
strategy, one should suspect severe bleeding, check the HCT and
transfuse fresh packed red cells/fresh whole blood urgently.10, level III
Differential diagnosis of high lactate (>2.2 mmol/L) includes acute
renal failure and acute liver failure secondary to severe dengue. Other
causes are co-infections e.g. leptospirosis, salmonellosis or other
superimposed bacterial sepsis.
Sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis caused by tissue hypoxia
is not recommended for pH ≥7. Bicarbonate therapy is associated
with sodium and fluid overload, increase in lactate, hypercarbia and
decrease in serum ionised calcium. A left shift in the oxyhaemoglobin
dissociation curve due to sodium bicarbonate administration may
aggravate the tissue hypoxia.10, level III
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
27
Hyperchloraemia, caused by the administration of large volumes of
0.9% sodium chloride solution (chloride concentration of 154 mmol/L),
may cause hyperchloraemic acidosis with normal lactate levels. If
serum chloride levels increase, use Hartmann’s solution or Ringer’s
lactate as crystalloid. These do not worsen the lactic acidosis.10, level III
5.2.10 Treatment for dengue with neurological involvement
Prevalence of neurological involvement in children admitted with
dengue infection varies at 0.5 - 9.5%.40 - 42, level III A wide-spectrum
of neurological manifestations have been described including
encephalopathy, encephalitis, immune-mediated syndromes and
muscular dysfunctions.42 - 43, level III
Acute encephalopathy is the most common neurological complication
with prevalence at 0.5 - 5.1%.40, 42, level III Affected children usually present
with reduced level of consciousness which may be caused by multiple
underlying factors, including prolonged shock, hypoxia, cerebral
oedema, bleeding, metabolic abnormalities and acute liver or kidney
failure. Analysis of the CSF is usually normal. Prognosis is variable and
dependent on underlying contributing factors. Management is usually
supportive with emphasis on corrections of underlying metabolic and
haemodynamic abnormalities.42, 44, level III
Children with encephalitis can present with reduced consciousness,
headache, altered mental status and seizures. Clinical features may
be indistinguishable from encephalopathy. Presence of DENV by PCR,
NS1 Ag or dengue IgM antibody in CSF is helpful to differentiate the
condition from encephalopathy. Neuroimaging features are diverse and
nonspecific, with cerebral oedema being the most common finding.
Supportive management is recommended. Outcome is variable.42, level III
Immune-mediated neurological syndromes associated with dengue
infection have been described in paediatric populations. Acute
transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and
Guillain-Barre Syndrome usually follow their natural course. Standard
management as per the disorder is recommended.42, level III
• Acute
encephalopathy
is
the
most

neurological
complication of dengue. Its management is usually supportive with
emphasis on corrections of underlying metabolic and haemodynamic
abnormalities.
5.2.11 Treatment for dengue with liver involvement
Liver involvement is commonly seen in children with dengue infection
with prevalence ranging from 38.7% to 87%. Prevalence is generally
higher in the more severe category of dengue infection (dengue with
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
28
warning signs and severe dengue).45 - 46, level III The exact mechanisms
on liver injury are still not fully understood.
Spectrum of liver involvement ranges from mild elevation of liver
enzymes, AST and ALT levels to acute and fulminant liver failure. In
most children, the liver dysfunctions are mild with transient elevation
of AST and ALT levels (range 84.4% - 95.9%) and often asymptomatic.
47 - 48, level III Acute liver failure is rare (range 1.1% - 5.8%).47 - 49, level III
AST level is usually higher than ALT level in contrast to other causes of
viral hepatitis.50, level III This was postulated to be caused by the release
of AST from injured myocytes. The liver enzyme levels usually return to
normal values within 2 - 4 weeks after illness. 46, 49, level III
• Supportive management is recommended in dengue infection with
liver involvement and the prognosis is generally good.
• Those with acute or fulminant liver failure should be closely monitored
in critical care settings.
• Emphasis should be put on:
 early recognition of severe liver involvement
 stabilisation of haemodynamic status
 avoidance of hepatotoxic medications including acetaminophen
 close monitoring of neurological parameters
 management of hepatic encephalopathy
There is no evidence to support the routine use of N-Acetyl cysteine in
children with DF associated acute liver failure.
5.2.12 Treatment for dengue with cardiac involvement
Clinically significant cardiac involvement including myocarditis is
uncommon in children with dengue.
In an observational study on 181 hospitalised children with dengue,
left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction was seen in relation
to severity of plasma leakage. However, it was transient and resolved
spontaneously. Thus, treatment should mainly be focused on fluid
resuscitation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.51, level lll
5.2.13 Treatment for dengue with kidney involvement
The kidney is one of the major organs affected during dengue infection
in children. The exact mechanism and prevalence remain unclear.
Proteinuria is more often detected between day 5 and day 7 after onset
of fever, and usually normalises as the patients recover.52, level II-2
Some children with dengue may develop AKI following prolonged
shock due to inadequate fluid resuscitation. The treatment for this
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
29
condition is mainly supportive. If RRT is required, it should commence
only in haemodynamically stable patients. Continuous veno-venous
haemodialysis (CVVH) is the preferred mode of RRT. Peritoneal
dialysis may be considered if CVVH is not available, but it is associated
with high risk of bleeding. When RRT is not available or cannot be
carried out yet, the succeeding hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia and
hyperphosphataemia should be managed with allopurinol, potassium
binders (e.g. sodium polystyrene sulfonate, calcium polystyrene
sulfonate) and calcium carbonate respectively.10, level III
5.2.14 Blood transfusion
Blood transfusion is only indicated in patients with:10, level III
• massive bleeding
• occult bleeding with shock as evidenced by HCT decreasing
compared to baseline with unstable vital signs. Refer to Algorithm
3 and 4.
Internal bleeding may be difficult to recognise in the presence of
haemoconcentration.
• Decision to transfuse should be taken by senior clinicians to avoid
unnecessary transfusion which can lead to fluid overload especially
in neonates and infants.
 Do not wait for HCT level to drop too low before making the
decision.
 Consider to repeat blood transfusion if there is further overt blood
loss or no appropriate rise in HCT after blood transfusion in an
unstable patient.
The following blood and blood components are recommended for
transfusion:10, level III
i) red cells or whole blood
• for children, give 10 - 20 ml/kg/dose of fresh packed red cells or
fresh whole blood
• for neonates, give aliquots of 5 - 10 ml/kg of fresh packed red
cells or 10 - 20 ml/kg of fresh whole blood at an appropriate rate
The rate depends on the patient’s condition. The patient should be
monitored carefully to avoid fluid overload.
ii) platelet and fresh frozen plasma
• should be considered in invasive and surgical procedures if
severe bleeding is anticipated
• dose of platelet and fresh frozen plasma transfusion is 10 - 15
ml/kg
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
30
• There is no evidence to support the practice of transfusing platelet
and fresh frozen plasma for severe bleeding in dengue.10, level III
 However, the transfusion may be indicated based on clinical
judgement and if the patient does not respond to initial fresh
packed red cells or fresh whole blood transfusion.
Observational studies showed that platelet concentrates and fresh
frozen plasma transfusion in dengue were not able to sustain the
platelet counts and coagulation profile. It can also lead to fluid overload
in massive bleeding patient.10, level III
Recommendation 7
• Blood transfusion should be given in life-threatening condition and
given as soon as severe bleeding is recognised (overt) or suspected
(occult) in children with dengue.
 Selection of blood components is based on patient’s clinical
condition or type of bleeding.
 It should be given cautiously to avoid fluid overload especially in
neonates or infants.
5.3 Recovery Phase
If excessive IV fluids have been given, there is a risk of fluid overload
during critical and/or recovery phase e.g. respiratory distress from
massive pleural effusion and ascites, pulmonary oedema or congestive
heart failure. To avoid these complications, IV fluids should be
discontinued early.
To prevent nosocomial infection, venofix/branula or peripheral inserted
central catheter (PICC) need to be removed once there is no indication
for further IV therapy.
The treatment of fluid overload is dependent on the patient’s
haemodynamic stability, intravascular volume status and the timing of
this event with respect to the critical phase. Small doses of IV frusemide
0.1 - 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice or thrice daily or a continuous infusion of
frusemide 0.1 mg/kg/hour may be indicated for patients who are out of
the critical phase.10, level III

SPECIAL GROUPS
6.1 Neonates
Neonates can acquire DENV through vertical transmission or at the time
of delivery. They may be asymptomatic and the clinical manifestations
vary from mild to severe illness.10, level III
Symptomatic and supportive treatment under close observation is
the mainstay of treatment in neonates with dengue infection.10, level III
Consultation with neonatologists is advisable.
6.2 Infants
In general, dengue in infants is due to primary infection but the
manifestations could be severe as infants might have received dengue
antibodies transplacentally from their mother.
Clinical presentation of dengue in infants is similar to older children.
10, level III They may present with coryza symptoms e.g. cough, nasal
congestion and runny nose. However, presence of febrile convulsion,
vomiting, diarrhoea and petechial rash are significantly associated
with dengue among infants. Most of the infants with dengue are 4 - 10
months of age.10, 53, level III
It is often not possible to differentiate between dengue and other infections
in infants (e.g. pneumonia, bacterial sepsis, meningoencephalitis, other
viral exanthems, rotavirus infections, etc.) at the febrile stage.10, level III
Compared to those with acute undifferentiated febrile illness, infants
with dengue infection are more likely to have:53, level III
• petechiae, bruises, hepatomegaly and clinical evidence of systemic
leakage
• lower WBC count and platelet nadirs
• higher liver transaminases and HCT level
• Infants have relatively low normal value of HCT (28 - 42%) compared
with older children and may be even lower in iron deficiency
anaemia.10, level III
 Any increment of ≥20% from baseline HCT is considered
haemoconcentration. Refer to Table 6 on Range of Haematocrit
in Different Age Groups.
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)
32
Shock occurs because of severe plasma leakage and often preceded
by warning signs with subnormal body temperature. However, some
infants may still have fever at the onset of shock, thus differential
diagnosis of septic shock need to be considered.10, level III
Infants with dengue infection should be referred for in-hospital
management.10, level III
Recommendation 8
• Dengue infection in infant should be managed in a hospital with
paediatric services.
6.3 Red Cells Disorder
Haemolysis can be triggered during acute dengue illness. This manifests
in both early and late febrile stages of thalassemia. It may also occur in
other haemoglobinopathies and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency.54, level III
• Haemoconcentration during plasma leakage may be missed in
anaemic patients with dengue due to low baseline HCT level.54, level III
• Healthcare providers should use patients’ baseline Hb level to
calculate degree of haemoconcentration.
Fresh packed red cells or fresh whole blood should be given if
significant haemolysis is suspected.10, 54, level III

DISCHARGE
Patients who have been monitored for dengue may be discharged if
they fulfil the following clinical and/or laboratory criteria as shown in

TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
Traditional and complementary medicines (TCM) e.g. papaya leaf
extracts and crab soup are often used in dengue infection as part of
Malaysian cultural practices.
• There is no evidence on the safety and efficacy of TCM to support its
use in the treatment of dengue in children.
Clinical criteria
Laboratory criteria
• No fever for 24 - 48 hours
• Improvement in clinical status (general well-being,
appetite, haemodynamic status, urine output)
• Absence of respiratory distress
• Resolution or recovery of organ dysfunction
• Increasing trend of platelet count
• Stable HCT without IV fluids

PREVENTION STRATEGIES
9.1 Vaccination
Three multicentre placebo-controlled RCTs looked into the efficacy and
safety of CYD-TDV vaccine against dengue in children.
In the first RCT, the dengue vaccine was moderately efficacious
(54.8%, 95% CI 46.8 to 61.7) in symptomatic, virologically confirmed
dengue (VCD) with good safety profile when given as three injections
(months 0, 6 and 12) to children aged 2 - 14 years in endemic areas in
Asia.55, level I
Pooled analysis of two RCTs showed the dengue vaccine was efficacious
in children ≥9 years old against all severity dengue hospitalisation
(80.8%, 95% CI 70.1 to 87.7). The result was not in favour of younger
children. Analysis on long-term safety was not available then.56, level I
Further analysis of three RCTs demonstrated that the risk was higher
for hospitalisation in VCD (HR=1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.70) and severe
VCD (HR=2.87, 95% CI 1.09 to 7.61) in vaccinated subjects compared
with control in seronegative 2 to 16 years old participants. The vaccine
prevented hospitalisation in seropositive participants with HR of 0.32
(95% CI 0.23 to 0.45) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.58) for VCD and
severe VCD subjects respectively. Thus, the vaccine was protective in
those who had exposure to dengue before vaccination.57, level I
• More evidence is warranted especially on long-term safety profile
before dengue vaccination can be recommended.
9.2 Prevention of Mosquito Bite
Preventive measures on mosquito bite include the use of:3, level III
• clothing that minimises skin exposure during daylight hours when
mosquitoes are most active
• repellents on exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with
label instructions
• insecticide-treated mosquito nets during sleeping
• household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils or other
insecticide vaporisers
• household fixtures e.g. window and door screens and airconditioning
Although no evidence could be found to support the efficacy of repellent
in reducing dengue incidence,58, level III experts advocate the use of
repellent.

10. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
Implementation of CPG is important as it helps in providing quality
healthcare services based on best, recent available evidence applied
to local scenario. Various factors and resource implications should be
considered for the success of the uptake in the CPG recommendations.
10.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors
The facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:
i. availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and
softcopies)
ii. conferences and updates on management of dengue in children
including those who involved in professional bodies
iii. Clinical Audit on Dengue Mortality
iv. public awareness activities e.g. COMBI (Communication for
Behavioural Impact)
Limiting factors in the CPG implementation include:
i. limited awareness and knowledge in management of dengue in
children among healthcare providers
ii. variation in treatment practice and preferences among
healthcare providers
iii. insufficient resources especially trained personnel, diagnostic
kits and infrastructure
iv. misconception on the disease and its management by the public
10.2 Potential Resource Implications
To implement the CPG, there must be strong commitments to:
i. ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers
via printed copies and online accessibility
ii. reinforce training of healthcare providers via regular seminars
and workshops
iii. involve multidisciplinary team at all levels of health care
iv. improve the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities
v. train more experts in the field of dengue in children
Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)

To assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed
as clinical audit indicators for quality management:
Target of 75%
Implementation strategies will be developed following the approval of
the CPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module.
• Percentage of children
suspected of dengue

SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATION OF PERIPHERAL
VASOCONSTRICTION
Initial stage of shock (compensated)
• Quiet tachypnoea (tachypnoea without increased effort)
• Cold extremities and delayed capillary refill time (CRT) of >2 seconds
• Weak volume peripheral pulses
• Normal oxygen saturation (SpO2: 95 - 100%)
• Normal systolic pressure
• Diastolic pressure rises towards systolic pressure and pulse pressure
(difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) narrows
• Compensated metabolic acidosis (normal pH, low partial pressure of
carbon dioxide (pCO2) and low bicarbonate level)
• May remain conscious and alert
Worsening hypovolaemic shock (decompensated)
• Increasing tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction
• Cold and cyanosed extremities and, limbs become mottled, cold and clammy
• Rapid breathing and increases in depth - a compensation for the
metabolic acidosis
• Kussmaul’s breathing
• Hypotension
• Disappearance of peripheral pulses
• Weak central pulse (femoral)
• Cortical hypoperfusion manifested by poor eye contact, failure to
recognise parents or failure to respond to painful stimuli e.g. venepuncture
• Change in mental state (restless, confused, extremely lethargic, seizures)
*children and young adults have been known to have a clear mental
status even in profound shock
Prolonged hypotensive shock
• Severe metabolic acidosis
• Multiple organ failure e.g. acute liver and renal failure, encephalopathy,
cardiomyopathy
• Major bleeding*
• Coagulation abnormalities e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation
*may occur in the absence of shock if the child is given NSAIDs, acetylsalicylic
acid or corticosteroids

CALCULATION OF IDEAL BODY WEIGHT (IBW) FOR
OBESE CHILDREN
If patient’s height is within 5th and 95th centile of age, use Moore method
as below:
• the IBW is the weight for age on the same percentile as height.
For example, a child with a height at the 10th centile can have his IBW
determined by looking at the growth chart and finding the weight at
the 10th centile for his age.
If patient’s height exceeds 95th centile for age, use McLaren method as
below:
• weight at the 50th centile for height age chart
Use steps as below for IBW:
i. plotting the child’s height for age
ii. extending a line horizontally to the 50th centile height-for-age line
iii. extending a line vertically from the 50th centile height-for-age to
the corresponding 50th centile weight and note this IBW
Refer to the growth chart below for method of plotting.
