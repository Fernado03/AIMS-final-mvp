‘STATEMENT OF INTENT
The clinical practice guidelines are meant to be a guide for clinical practice, based
‘on the best available evidence at the time of development. Adherence to these
guidelines may not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual
patient care. Every healthcare provider is responsible for the management of
‘their patient based on the clinical presentation and management options
available locally.
These guidelines were first issued in December 2015 and will be reviewed in
2019 or earlier if new evidence becomes available.

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
The Development Group for this Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) consisted of
Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons, Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine Specialists,
Paediatric Dental Specialists, Dental Public Health Specialists and Dental
Officers. Clinical audit indicators have also been identified for the purpose of
monitoring and evaluating outcomes.
Evidence was retrieved from publications from the 1972 onwards. Literature search
was carried out using the following electronic databases: PUBMED/MEDLINE;
Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); Health Technology Assessment
(HTA) and full text journal articles via OVID search engine. In addition, the
reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further
studies. The search process was conducted between May 2012 and May 2013,
and only literatures in English were included,
All articles retrieved were appraised by at least two members and graded
according to the levels of evidence presented in the form of evidence tables and
discussed during group meetings. The levels of evidence table were adopted from
the modified version of the United States (U.S) / Canadian Preventive Services Task
Force, while the grading of recommendations was based on the modified version
of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). The CPG was based
on the findings of relevant published evidence.
The draft was reviewed by a team of internal / external reviewers and was
available on the websites of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia and Academy of
Medicine, Malaysia for comments and feedback, Recommendations were
presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, and finally to the
Health Technology Assessment and CPG Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for
approval.

Ameloblastoma
‘A benign but locally aggressive tumour of odontogenic
epithelium arising from the mandible, or less
commonly from the maxilla.
Carnoy’s
solution
Slightly yellow liquid with chloroform odour.lt is
composed of 3 ml of chloroform (30%),6 ml of absolute
ethanol (Ethyl Alcohol 60%),1 ml of glacial acec acid
(Acec Acid 10%), and1 g of ferric chloride.
Central giant
cell granuloma
A rarely aggressive idiopathic benign intraosseous lesion
that occurs almost exclusively in the jaws.This osteolytic
lesion histologically consists of pro-liferaon of fibrous
tissue, hemorthagic focuses, hemosiderin deposits,
osteoclast-like giant cells,and reactive bone formation.
A treatment in which the lesion is frozen using liquid
nitrogen.
Dental lamina
A thickened epithelial band along the margin of the
‘gum, in the embryo, from which the enamel organs are
developed.
Dredging
Enucleation
Aconservative surgical procedure in which, after deflation
and enucleation or only enucleation, repeated dredging,
is applied to accelerate new bone formation by removing,
‘out the scar tissue from the bony cavity.
Removal of entire lesion or tumour from an enveloping
cover or sac in such a way it comes out clean and
whole.
Epithelial rest
of Malassez
An epithelial remnant of Hertwig’s sheath in the
periodontal membrane, which sometimes develops
into dental cyst.
‘Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
Exenteration | Surgical removal of the inner organs, commonly
used to indicate radical excision of the contents of a
body cavity.
Malocclusion —_| Teeth which are not properly aligned.
Marsupialisation | Marsupialisation is the surgical technique of cutting a
slit into a cyst and suturing the edges of the slit to
form a continuous surface from the exterior to the
interior of the cyst. Sutured in this fashion, the cyst
remains open and can drain freely.
Maxillary A surgical obturator replaces missing dentoalveolar
prostheses and/or palatal structures. They are usually used to
close oronasal and/or oroantral communications
following ablative cancer surgery or trauma,
Metastasize To form new foci of disease in another part of the body
Obturator A prosthetic device serves to close an opening in the
body.
Odontogenic Jaw cyst that is formed from tissues involved in
cyst odontogenesis (tooth development).
Odontogenic | An uncommon benign tumour of jaw, apparently arising
myxoma from the mesenchymal portion of tooth germ.
Odontogenic | Tumours in the jaws that arise from odontogenic (tooth
tumour forming) tissues
Odontomas ‘A tumour originating from a tooth and containing
dental tissue (as enamel, dentin, or cementum).
Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
Osseointegrated _ The process of bone growth right up to the implant
implants surface. No soft tissue connects the bone to the
surface of the implant. No scar tissue, cartilage or
ligament fibres are present between the bones and
implant surface. The direct contact of bone and
implant surface can be verified microscopically.
Ostectomy Excision of bone or part of bone.
Pedicle flap A flap consisting of the full thickness of the skin and
the subcutaneous tissue, attached by tissue through
which it receives its blood supply.
Prognosis A prediction of the probable course and outcome of a
disease/ the likelihood of recovery from a disease.
Recurrence Return of the disease after treatment and after a
period of time.
Resection Surgical removal or excision of a portion of an organ or
structure.
Unicentric Pertaining to or having a single centre (as of origin or
dispersal).
Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
8.8. Age
Because the craniofacial bones, teeth, and soft tissues of children and
adolescents are not completely developed, aggressive surgery has the
potential to cause irreversible deformities. Clinicians must not only treat the
disease but also consider the aesthetic and functional results in the light of
the postoperative growth and development of these young patients.
Although excisional surgery achieves low recurrent rates, “'*”*!"" it may cause
facial deformity and dysfunction, affecting a young patient’s physical and
psychological development. Conservative treatment can achieve good
results, either curing the disease or effectively controlling the progression of
the disease until maturity allow for complete excision. “vel!
Recommendation 2
* Solid and multicystic ameloblastomas should be treated by surgical
resection with a 1em-1.Scm margin. ean
'* Unicystic ameloblastomas should be treated by enucleation coupled
with an adjunctive procedure with Carnoy’s solution or liquid nitrogen.

1. INTRODUCTION
‘Ameloblastomas are tumours that originate from odontogenic epithelial tissue
which are involved in the tooth formation and classified as benign odontogenic
tumours by the World Health Organization (2005)..'**!"" it is the most commonly
encountered odontogenic tumour when odontomas are excluded. ®: "4 They
rarely develop into @ malignant growth and metastasize but they can result in
lesions that lead to severe abnormalities in the jaw and face. > '**!"' Due to
variation in the method of treatment, recurrence rate ranges from 3.6% to
100%, 9 level
2. AETIOLOGY
Itis generally agreed that ameloblastoma arise from remnants of odontogenic
epithelium that failed to regress during embryonic development. They may
arise from rests of dental lamina, epithelial rest cell of Malassez or enamel
forming organ. If these cell rests are situated outside the bone in the soft
tissues of gingival and edentulous alveolar mucosa, they may give rise to
peripheral ameloblastoma. It is also agreed that solid multicystic ameloblastoma
may arise as a result of neoplastic changes in the lining or wall of a
non-neoplastic odontogenic cyst, in particular dentigerous and odontogenic
keratocysts, level M10 tve is
3. CLASSIFICATION AND HISTOLOGICAL FEATURES

4.1. Relative frequency
One of the largest retrospective study of ameloblastoma published in 1995
noted that the relative frequency of ameloblastoma in correlation to odontogenic
tumours is between 11 and 92 percent, and that ameloblastoma forms 1 percent
of all tumours and cyst of the jaws. 2°-level 3
In one of the earliest study of ameloblastoma in Malaysia, it was observed
that the tumour formed 1.1 percent of all oral pathology cases reported. *
‘eel When the frequency of ameloblastoma was correlated to all
‘odontogenic tumours and cysts, Malaysia was noted to have a rate of 12.4
percent as compared to neighbouring Thailand with 6.7 percent, and Japan
with 3.3 percent. * level lt

‘The geographical differences noted in Siar and Ng’s earlier study in 1993 has
also been described in other reports. ?19:'evellt:20,level"-3 Racial differences

among the various ethnic groups has recently been reported, with Malays
accounting for 47.6%, Chinese 34.8%, Indians 7.0%, and remaining ethnic

43. Age
In Malaysia, patients diagnosed with ameloblastoma had a wide age range of
between 7 to 85 years, with mean age of diagnosis at 30.3#16.3 years, and
peak incidence in the second decade of life. ** !eve!"!
The younger patients seen in Malaysia when compared to the average age of
35.9 years, concur with Reichart et al’s (1995) findings that patients from
developing countries present with the disease at an earlier age as compared
to those from industrialized countries. 1° level "=
‘Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
Ameloblastoma is uncommon in children. The occurrence was reported
between 8.7% - 19.7% with the average age at diagnosis of 14.5 years, and
less than 10% of childhood cases occurred under the age of 10 years. 2°24

many adults diagnosed in their mid-30s had tumours since childhood, 1?:'«¥*!'"
4.4. Gender
The gender ratio (male:female) when all ameloblastomas are considered in
Malaysia is 1.4:1, while the ratio reported in one of the largest series of
ameloblastoma was 1,14:1.20, level 13:14, level

5. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS
5.1. Clinical examination
The diagnosis of the ameloblastoma is achieved by the clinical examination based
Con the signs and symptoms, radiological and the histological examination of the
lesion. All lesions must be biopsied. For cystic lesion of more than 3cm, an
incisional biopsy is to be done first, especially if it perforates the cortical
bone, 25 lve
Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
5.2. Signs and Symptoms
Ameloblastoma is usually unicentric, slow growing, locally invasive and will
infiltrate through the medullary spaces and can erode cortical bone and
extend into adjacent tissue, if left untreated. Patients commonly present
with painless swelling of jaw and additional symptoms can include
malocclusion, pain, tooth mobility, il-ftting dentures, ulceration, paraesthesia
and/or anaesthesia of the affected area. 77. eve!" Siar et al, 2011 reported
that painless swelling was the most common complaint (73.3%) among
Malaysian. Other symptoms are numbness (5.2%), soft tissue growth (4.4%),
discharging sinus (3.0%) and a non-healing extraction socket (0.7%). & 'eve!l!

5.3. Recurrence Rate
Recurrence can occur up to 21 years after treatment; more than 50% of
recurrences are encountered within the first 5 years after treatment. '«v"!!"
There is weak evidence showing that resection resulted in the lowest
recurrence rate (3.6%), followed by enucleation with application of Carnoy's
solution (16%). Enucleation alone resulted in the highest recurrence rate
(30.59%). * !*¥*!" The mainstay of treatment is surgery, with wide resection is
recommended due to the high recurrence rate of solid/multicystic
ameloblastomas. The recurrence rate after resection is 13-15%, as opposed
to 90-100% after curettage. 98 vel!

6. INVESTIGATIONS
6.1. Radiological Investigation
Conventional radiographs, Computed Tomographs (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) have been predominantly used for evaluation of
ameloblastomas. The typical features of multilocular or unilocular
radiolucency in conventional radiographs are not pathognomonic of
ameloblastoma and may also indicate other odontogenic tumours/cysts
such as keratocystic odontogenic tumours, 32 !vel!
Ultrasound can be as a supplementary non-radiation diagnostic method for
mandibular ameloblastoma. It can also be used to distinguish cystic from
solid contents in the tumour, 2?'**! "! in addition, colour Doppler flow
imaging (COFI) may be used to determine the active proliferation of the
tumour. *:!**!!" However ultrasound and CDFI are not routinely used.
6.2. Radiographic Features
In most cases, ameloblastoma have a characteristic but not diagnostic
radiographic appearance. The neoplasm usually appears as a unilocular
radiolucent area or a multilocular radiolucent area with a honeycomb
appearance. Resorption of the adjacent tooth roots is not uncommon. In
many cases of an unerupted tooth, most often a mandibular third molar, is
associated with the tumour. 27: 33:ev*! "\ The radiographic differential diagnosis
includes a variety of odontogenic cysts, a keratocystic odontogenic tumour,
an odontogenic myxoma, as well as non-odontogenic tumours and cysts,
such as a central giant cell granuloma and a simple bone cyst, respectively.
6.3. Histological Investigation
The importance of an accurate preoperative histological diagnosis in the
treatment of ameloblastoma cannot be over emphasized. The individual
histologic patterns have no effect on the clinical behaviour of the tumour.
2, 1-12, 4 lee! The tumour has been separated into several subtypes of
ameloblastoma, each with its own distinct biological behaviour requiring
different forms of treatment. #41242, level
Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
It is generally accepted that there is no relationship between the individual
histologic patterns and the behaviour of the tumour or its prognosis.
Histologic pattern is not to be confused with the designation of solid or
multicystic, unicystic or peripheral types, as these descriptors have considerable
impact on the patients’ treatment and prognosis. 2276.3 level it

A differential diagnosis of ameloblastoma is achieved by the clinical features

growing swelling of the jaw with bucco-lingual bony expansion. The mobility
of teeth will also be observed if a substantial amount of bone resorption has
occurred.
‘An orthopantomogram will show radiolucency which is unilocular or
multilocular with evidence of resorption of the adjacent teeth. Further
radiological investigations such as CT scan or MRI can further evaluate the
extent of the tumour prior to surgery. 24 !evell!

Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has also been found useful and
‘minimally invasive in achieving a diagnosis of ameloblastoma in some cases.

8. MANAGEMENT
‘The options for management of ameloblastomas are;
i. enucleation with or without adjunctive procedures
i, dredging
i. resection
81. Enucleation
Enucleation refers to surgically shelling the lesion out of the bone. The aim is
to remove the whole cyst/tumour without leaving any visible remnants
behind. If remnants were expected to have been left behind, enucleation
can be coupled with adjunctive procedures like peripheral ostectomy,
application of Carnoy’s solution or liquid nitrogen cryotherapy. Recurrence
rates with adjunctive procedures are lower compared to enucleation alone.
40, level Enucleation alone shows higher recurrence rates (30.5%) ® eve!!!
compared to enucleation plus adjunctive procedures (16%), or wide excision,
even for the unicystic variety. 4°47 level"
8.2, Enucleation plus adjunctive procedures
The most common adjunctive treatment was the application of Carnoy's
solution. This method has a lower recurrence rate (16%) compared to
enucleation alone or marsupialization for unicystic ameloblastoma.4?- 23!!!
8.3. Dredging
Dredging is a conservative surgical procedure in which following
enucleation, repeated dredging/curettage is applied to accelerate new
bone formation by removing the scar tissue from the bony cavity. Dredging
is carried out at 2-3 month intervals until tumour cells are not seen in scar
tissue removed by 2 consecutive dredging. Evidence base for this procedure
is small but recurrence rates are comparable to enucleation coupled with
adjunctive procedures, #1 !ev!l!
t of Ameloblastoma 2015
Managem:
Dredging or curettage is a procedure where enucleation of the lesion is
followed by repeated curettage of scar tissue from the bony margins to
eradicate any residual tumour cells and promote new bone formation.
Dredging is applied at 2-3 month intervals and stopped when tumour cells are
ot present in microscopic examination of the scar tissue removed by two
consecutive dredging.
In very large cysts/tumours, marsupialisation maybe carried out first to
reduce the size of the lesion, before enucleation or dredging is undertaken.
Marsupialisation (decompression) refers to surgically removing the superficial
bony wall of the lesion, and suturing the incised edge of the cyst/tumour to
the adjacent mucosa. Most lesions do reduce in size and some may
completely resolve without further treatment. “3: level #
8.4. Resection
Resection refers to either segmental resections of the mandible or maxilla
without maintaining continuity or marginal resection with preservation of
bony continuity. This method of treatment will usually require some form of
reconstruction by non-vascularised or vascularised grafts and flaps, depending
‘on the site and size of the resultant defect. Surgery should be performed with
a 1cm to 1.5cm bony margin free of tumour, “*"'*¥!""" A more radical approach
is necessary for solid or multicystic ameloblastomas, “°°. *¥*!" Regardless of
subtype, this method of treatment results in the lowest rate of recurrence in
all age groups, 47-48. level
8.5. Choice of Treatment
The goal of treatment in the management of ameloblastomas should be the
eradication of the disease with no recurrence. Ameloblastomas, although
locally invasive and aggressive, are essentially benign
‘Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
in nature, and thus it is advocated to be treated as such, with adoption of a
more conservative approach to management. “25! 'eve! | However more
recent evidence indicates such conservative methods like enucleation
appear to result in high recurrence rates. “'25:'ev*!" Several factors need
to be considered when deciding on the method of treatment for
ameloblastomas. They include:
3 ‘Subtypes
i, Site
iil, Age of patient
8.6, Subtype
Ameloblastomas are classified into 3 subtypes: solid and multicystic,
tunicystic and peripheral (which are not included in this review). In general,
ameloblastomas are slow growing, locally invasive benign tumours.
However the solid and multicystic variant tends to be locally aggressive
with a high recurrence potential if inadequately excised. The unicystic
ameloblastoma is thought to have recurrence potential, but is less
aggressive and may respond to enucleation and/or curettage. ©"! ""
8&7. Site
In general, although histologically identical, maxillary lesions can be more
‘troublesome than mandibular lesions. The maxilla lacks the thick confining
cortical plates of the mandible, thereby allowing spread of the tumour to
surrounding vital structures. “* '*¥*!"" Spread to the posterior walll of the
maxillary sinus, pterygomaxillary space, greater palatine canal and base of
skull have been described. °?-°4-'ev*!" adjunctive procedures like Carnoy’s
solution and liquid nitrogen are more difficult to apply to the maxilla as,
they cannot normally be applied in the sinus or nasal cavity, which is usually
involved.

8.9, Management in Children
‘Ameloblastomas in children and adolescents are thought to be rare. They
account for approximately 10-15% of all reported cases of ameloblastoma
55°56, level ll As the tumour grows slowly, some authors have proposed the
theory that ameloblastoma probably starts to develop in childhood, °7:!*v*!
™ The unicystic ameloblastoma is the most commonly reported type of
ameloblastoma in children. ** 'eve!
The treatment of ameloblastoma is controversial and presents some special
problems in children. Incomplete growth of jaws and the prognosis of the
‘tumour in children make the surgical consideration different from adults as
it can cause irreversible deformities and poor aesthetic results in light of
postoperative growth and development of young patients,
Consequently, some advocate that ameloblastoma is treated conservatively
with decompression, enucleation and peripheral ostectomy as well as
periodic long-term follow up. °”59 **!"" The basis for this conservative
approach was suggested as the majority of ameloblastoma in children are
Uunicystic which tend to have much lower rates of recurrence (10-25%) than
‘the multicystic or solid types. 7 level!"
Whilst the conservative surgical approach results in a good appearance and
functional recovery, a more aggressive surgical approach such as marginal
‘or segmental resection may be considered when the condition recurs or the
ameloblastoma is of multicystic or solid types. °* evel"
Recommendation 3
Decompression followed by enucleation can be effective in controlling
progression of disease until maturity allows for complete excision or even
curing the disease. Good compliance for regular follow-up is important
for successful treatment when the conservative approach is chosen.

9, RECONSTRUCTION
Reconstruction is the procedure to re-establish anatomy and function of the facial
structures.lt is needed for aesthetic and function of the jaws after resection of
maxilla or mandible. In current practice, there are several means of
reconstruction,
9.1. Reconstruction of resected maxilla
Reconstruction of maxillary defects could be carried out by several options
namely maxillary prostheses, local pedicle flaps, soft tissue free flaps and
vascularized bone flaps. °° 'v*!'"" prostheses could be used either alone or
in addition to surgical flaps, depending on the defect. © !evel!
The prosthesis restores the oronasal separation, which is fundamental for
speaking and swallowing. Dentition can be included for cosmesis and chewing,
The surgical complexity and length of procedure is less with obturators than
with tissue reconstruction.
Figure 4 : Maxillary reconstruction using full prosthesis
9.2. Reconstruction of Resected Mandible
Loss of mandible continuity results in alteration in speech, swallowing and
mastication, and in the appearance of the patient. ®ve!"
‘Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
9.3. Reconstruction With Vascularized Bone Graft
With the advent of microsurgery, many reconstructive surgeons have
adopted vascularised bone grafts such as rib, metatarsal, iliac, radial,
scapular and fibular. Fibula became a popular graft because of a straight
forward dissection which facilitates a two-team approach. Furthermore, this
flap provides enough long as well as strong bicortical bone of excellent
quality which can endure physical stress, ie. in terms of mastication, necessary
for the reconstructed mandible after placement of osseointegrated implants.
66-68, level "Today, the trend is toward early reconstruction. Full dental
reconstruction is impossible without osseointegrated implants because
conventional dentures are difficult to adapt to the transplanted bone.
69, level
9.4. Reconstruction With Non-vascularized Bone Graft
A variety of methods has been proposed for mandibular reconstruction
using non-vascularised bone grafts or alloplastic implants.
Non-vascularized iliac crest bone grafts for segmental reconstruction of the
mandible is the method of choice on the condition that the defect is at the
posterior (ramus-body) region. 7° 'evel ll

bone graft from iliac bone.
Management of Ameloblastoma 2015
9.5. Reconstruction With Reconstruction Plate Only
‘The reconstruction plate provides a predictable, safe and efficient means for the
surgeon to maintain mandibular continuity. ®'**"" Although microsurgical bone
transplant is still the gold standard, mandibular reconstruction plates (MRP)
were for several years considered a fast and safe way to restore mandibular
continuity without using bone graft. New plate designs with locking
screws have been recently introduced, and these may overcome some of the
complications related to previous designs, “7% level
Durable mandibular reconstruction with plates offers the possibility of
reconstituting the mandible in patients with a poor prognosis or medically
compromised which are not fit for a long surgery. Reconstruction plate is used
when predicted life expectancy is low and when medical conditions preclude
prolonged general anaesthesia, 7273. «ve!
10. FOLLOW UP
Long term follow-up is important, 6 6*70. 64, 72-73, level The first five years is
critical, 666 69-70, 64,73, level Thereafter biannual follow-up for at least 10 years
