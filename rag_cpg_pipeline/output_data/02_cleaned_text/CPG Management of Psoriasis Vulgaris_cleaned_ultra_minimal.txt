MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
STATEMENT OF INTENT
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are meant to be guides for clinical practice, based
on the best available evidence at the time of development. Adherence to these guidelines
may not necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider
is responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical picture
presented by the patient and the management options available locally.
These guidelines were issued in 2013 and will be reviewed in 2017 or sooner if new
evidence becomes available.

MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The members of the Development Group (DG) for this Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG)
were from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Higher Education. There was
active involvement of a multidisciplinary review committee (RC) during the process of
development of this CPG.
A systematic literature search was carried out using the following databases: Guidelines
International Network (G-I-N); Medline via Ovid, Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic
Reviews (CDSR) and International Health Technology Assessment websites. A search
strategy to cover all aspects on management of psoriasis was developed in the Medline
database and adapted to other databases. Search strategies were a combination of
MeSH and keyword searches including abbreviations (refer to Appendix 1 on an
example of Search Strategy). Search was restricted to human studies; literature
published in English language and the last ten years. If the evidence was insufficient, the
period of publication was extended for another ten years. In addition, the reference lists
of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies.
All searches were conducted from August 2011 till December 2012. Literature searches
were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process. The
aim was to identify any further relevant papers published before 28 February 2013 to be
included. Future CPG update will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The
details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.
Reference was also made to other CPGs on Psoriasis such as i) Guidelines on the treatment
of psoriasis vulgaris by the German Society of Dermatology (2012), ii) The assessment
and management of psoriasis by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE 2012), iii) Canadian Guidelines for the Management of Plaque Psoriasis by the
Canadian Dermatology Association (2012), iv) Diagnosis and management of psoriasis
and psoriatic arthritis in adults by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2010)
and v) Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis by the
American Academy of Dermatology (2009).
These CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation
(AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. The Ministry of Health had published a
Protocol for Biologic Intervention for Psoriasis (2011) and a Technology Review on Biologic
for Psoriasis (2011). This CPG incorporated recommendations from these two publications.
A total of 25 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the
DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2) The DG
members had met 21 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature
retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
checklist, presented in evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All
statements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the DG and
RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the
DG and RC. These CPG are based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses
and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.
The evidence used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive Services
Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of recommendation was modified from
grades of recommendation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.
On completion, the draft guidelines was sent for review by external reviewers. It was also
posted on the MOH Malaysia official website for feedback from any interested parties.
The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, the HTA
and CPG Council MOH Malaysia for review and approval.
OBJECTIVES
The aims of this CPG are
•

MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
1. INTRODUCTION
Psoriasis is a genetically determined, systemic immune-mediated chronic inflammatory
disease that affects primarily the skin and joints. It has been estimated to affect 1 - 3%
of the general population worldwide.
Plaque psoriasis, the most common form, seen in 80 - 90% of patients, is characterized
by sharply demarcated erythematous plaques.1- 5, level III; 6, level II-2 Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)
occurs in up to 50% of patients with psoriasis.7, level II-2 Although not usually life-threatening,
psoriasis can be mentally and physically disabling. Patients not only have to deal with
their highly visible skin disease, they also endure physical discomfort such as tightness,
pain, bleeding and itch. Studies have shown that psoriasis causes as much disability
as other major medical diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension,
arthritis and depression.8- 9, level III
Furthermore, several studies have shown that patients with psoriasis are more prone
to cardiovascular disease, stroke, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.10 - 15, level
II-2 The risk of developing these important co-morbidities such as myocardial infarction
(MI) appears to correlate with severity of skin lesions. Young adults with severe psoriasis
have a 3-fold increased risk of developing MI and a reduction of 3 - 4 years in life
expectancy.10-11, level II-2; 14, level II-2 There is also increasing evidence that controlling chronic
inflammation of psoriasis with systemic agents or biologics may reduce cardiovascular
co-morbidity.12, level II-2; 15, level II-2, 16
Although cure is not available, skin clearance can occur with appropriate treatment.
Unfortunately, surveys showed that patients frequently received suboptimal care or were
on ineffective treatment for longer than neccessary.17-18, level III Hence, these guidelines are
developed to provide an evidence-based guidance to all health care providers involved
in the care of adults with chronic plaque psoriasis. To ensure that all patients receive
appropriate and adequate care, treatment goals and recommendations are clearly stated.
1.1 EPIDEMIOLOGY
Psoriasis occurs worldwide. Its prevalence varies greatly among different countries and
ranges from 0.2% in China to 4.8% in Norway.19, level II-2 A recent study using a national
health insurance database documented a prevalence of 0.24% in Taiwan with a male:
female ratio of 1.59:1.20, level II-2 There is no local population-based epidemiological study
on psoriasis. However, prevalence of psoriasis among Malaysian dermatology clinic
attendees ranges from 2% to 6%.21, level III; 5, level III Studies on incidence of psoriasis are very
rare. One study reported an annual incidence of 78.9 (95% CI 75.0 to 82.9) per 100,000
population in the United States of America (US) population and incidence is higher in
males (p=0.003).22, level III Another study reported an incidence rate of 14 per 10,000
person-years in United Kingdom (UK) with a slightly higher rate in males after 30 years
old.23, level II-2 Psoriasis was first diagnosed before the age of 40 in 40% of patients.22, level II-2
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Male preponderance was also seen in a Malaysian study with a male: female ratio of
1.7:1 (p<0.001).5, level III Males accounted for 56.4% of 4445 patients registered in the
Malaysian national psoriasis registry.2, level III The mean age of onset for psoriasis in Malaysia
was 33 years,21, level III; 2, level III, 5, level III which was lower than that observed in other countries
(41 years in Sweden, 4, level III 43 years in US 22, level III and 46 years in Taiwan.19, level II-2).
Malays accounted for 48.5% of registered psoriasis patients, Chinese 24.3% and Indians
17.8%,2, level III suggesting a higher prevalence of psoriasis in Indians when compared to the
ethnic distribution of Malaysia (67.4% Malays, 24.8% Chinese and Indian 7.3%) based
on 2010 population census. A similar finding was observed among Malaysian Indians in
another study (p<0.001).5, level III
The majority of patients (66.3%) in the Malaysian psoriasis registry had Type 1 psoriasis
which is defined as onset of psoriasis by age 40.2, level III A positive family history of 17.1%
to 29.0 % was observed in Malaysian patients with psoriasis.21, level III; 2-3, level III; 5, level III
2. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND RISK FACTORS
2.1 Clinical Characteristics
Psoriasis is a common skin disease with several distinct clinical phenotypes. Besides the
presence of skin lesions, most patients (80%) also have associated symptom such as
skin pain (41.7%, 95% CI 31.8 to 50) and skin discomfort (36.7%, 95% CI 29.1 to 45).24,
level II-2; 1, level III The most common symptom is desquamation (68%), followed by pruritus
(41%),1, level III; 4, level III dry skin (40%) and erythema (30%).1, level III Although embarrassment
from excessive desquamation and pruritus are common complaints, there is no study
documenting the extent of physical discomfort suffered by psoriasis patients in Malaysia.
Consistent with studies from other countries,1, level III; 24, level II-2; 25, level III plaque psoriasis is
the commonest type of psoriasis accounting for 85.3% of the 4445 patients registered
in Malaysian Psoriasis Registry. Other phenotypes include guttate psoriasis (4.7%),
erythrodermic psoriasis (2.6%), pustular (1.5%) and flexural/inverse psoriasis (0.5%).
Lower limbs (81.1%) is the commonest site affected, followed by scalp (80.4%), upper
limbs (76.8%), trunk (73.9%), nail (59.8%) and face/neck (50.1%). The commonest nail
abnormality is pitting (71.5%).2, level III
The majority of Malaysian patients (76.4%) have mild psoriasis (Body Surface Area [BSA]
≤10%) while 23.6% have moderate-severe psoriasis (BSA >10%). PsA is present in
16%. The commonest clinical pattern is oligo/monoarthropathy, followed by rheumatoidlike symmetrical polyarthropathy, distal hand joints arthropathy, spondylitis and arthritis
mutilans.2, level III
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
2.2 Assessment of Severity
Various instruments are available to measure the severity of psoriasis. BSA involvement
is widely used in daily clinical practice but it has not been validated.26, level III Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index (PASI) is the gold standard to assess the physical severity of
plaque-type psoriasis because it is the best validated tool with good internal consistency,
good intraobserver variation and acceptable interobserver variation.26-27, level III; 28, level II-2;
Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is another validated tool to assess physical severity
with good intraobserver and acceptable interobserver variation.27, level III
PASI, PGA and BSA do not reflect the psychosocial impact of mild psoriasis located on
critical areas such as face, hands and genitalia. Short Form 36 (SF36), Dermatology Life
Quality Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) are commonly used to measure the
impact of psoriasis on patient’s quality of life (QoL). Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
is validated, concise and simple to use in clinical practice.28-29, level III Hence, assessing the
severity of psoriasis should include an objective evaluation of the disease extent and its
impact on the patient’s health-related quality of life. Description of the assessment tools
and grading of disease severity are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively.
PGA or PASI is a sufficient tool for assessing the physical severity in patients with moderate
to severe psoriasis.
Table 1: Assessment Tools for Measuring Psoriasis Severity
Tools
Description
PGA
Measures severity based on induration, erythema and scaling (refer appendix 4)
BSA
Measures percentage of body surface affected by psoriasis based on “rule of
9” or taking patient’s one palm-size (flat hand with thumb and fingers) as 1%
↓ BSA 75=75% reduction in BSA after treatment
↓ BSA 50=50% reduction in BSA after treatment
PASI
Measures severity (erythema, scaling and induration) and extent of involvement
based on four regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) with score
ranging from 0 - 72 (refer appendix 5)
•
PASI 75=75% reduction in PASI score after treatment
•
PASI 50=50% reduction in PASI score after treatment
DLQI
Questionnaire to assess impact of psoriasis on quality of life. Score ranges from
0 to 30. (refer appendix 6)
•
0 to1 - no effect at all
•
2 to 5 - small effect
•
6 to 10- moderate effect
•
11 to 20 - very large effect
•
21 to 30- extremely large effect

Recommendation 1
•
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) or percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA)
involvement should be used to assess the physical severity of psoriasis. (Grade C)
•
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) should be used to measure the impact of psoriasis
on the quality of life of patients. (Grade C)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
2.3 Risk and Aggravating Factors
It is difficult to differentiate between risk and aggravating factors in psoriasis. Retrievable
studies discussed these factors interchangeably. The following have been identified as
significant risk factors for the condition:-
2.3.1 Family History
A positive family history is a significant risk factor for psoriasis (OR ranging from 5.4 to
34).30, level ll-2; 31, level ll-2, 32, level ll-2 Patients with a positive family history have their first symptoms
of psoriasis 9.5 years earlier than those without (p=0.008).21, level III
2.3.2 Alcohol Consumption
Alcohol consumption of >5 drinks/month (OR=3.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 8.1) is a risk factor in
men for psoriasis.33, level II-2 However, its role as a risk factor in women is inconclusive.34,
level II-2; 33, level II-2
2.3.3 Obesity
Obesity is a risk factor for psoriasis (Body Mass Index [BMI] >30, RR=1.5, 95% CI 1.2
to1.9; BMI >35, RR=2.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 3.4).35, level II-2
2.3.4 Smoking
A significant risk factor for psoriasis is current smoking with OR ranging from 1.7 to 1.9.33,
II-2, 23 , level ll-2, 36, level II-2 The risk is dose dependent (11 - 20 pack-years, RR=1.6, 95% CI 1.3
to 2.0; >20 pack-years, RR=2.1, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.5) The risk remains significant in past
smokers, except in those who have quit more than 20 years.37, level II-2 Environment tobacco
exposure is also a significant risk factor (OR=2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.7).30, level II-2
2.3.5 Psychological Factors
Significant psychological risk factors for psoriasis are stressful life event (OR=2.2, 95%
CI 1.4 to 3.4),36, level ll-2 divorce (OR=5.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 14.3) and change in work condition
(OR=8.3, 95% CI 1.9 to 37.4).38, level ll-2
2.3.6 History of Skin Disorders
Having a skin disorder within the past year is a risk factor for psoriasis (OR=3.6, 95%
CI 3.2 to 4.1).23, level ll-2
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
2.3.7 Recent Infections
A study using the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database showed that
having an episode of infectious disease in the last year increased the risk of psoriasis
(OR=1.6, 95%CI, 1.5 to 1.9). Risk of having psoriasis doubled in patients with infectious
skin disorders (OR=2.1, 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.4) and in patients aged 21 to 40 years who
had upper respiratory tract Infection in the past month.23, level ll-2 Acute pharyngitis as a risk
factor was confirmed by an Italian study (OR=7.8 95% CI 1.8 to 32.5).32, level ll-2
2.3.8 Koebner Phenomenon
Skin injury is a known risk factor for psoriasis (OR=1.6, p<0.01);39, level III Koebner
phenomenon (development of skin lesions at the site of injury) was observed in 5% of
early onset guttatte psoriasis in a Swedish study.4, level III
2.3.9 Physical Activity
Vigorous physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of psoriasis (RR=0.66, 95%
CI 0.54 to 0.81).40, level II-2
2.3.10 Drugs
Several drugs such as beta blockers, NSAIDs and lithium have been associated with
psoriasis based on anecdoctal reports. However, two population-based case-control
studies showed no significant association of psoriasis, with the use of antihypertensive
agents (beta blockers, angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel
blockers), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid or
central nervous system drugs.31, level ll-2; 23, level ll-2
2.4 Diagnosis and Investigation
Psoriasis is diagnosed clinically; however
biopsy may occasionally be needed to
confirm cases with atypical presentations.41,
level III
Chronic plaque psoriasis, the most common
type of psoriasis, is characterised by well
demarcated erythematous plaques with
silvery scales (Fig 1).
Fig.1: Erythematous scaly plaques
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
However erythema may be difficult to
appreciate on darker skin (Fig 2). Sites of
predilection are on extensor prominences
(Fig 3-4) and lumbosacral region (Fig 5).
Scalp (Fig 6) and nail involvements (Fig 7)
are useful clues to diagnosis.
Guttate psoriasis is usually seen in children
and adolescents after an upper respiratory
tract infection and is characterised by
multiple small plaques of psoriasis (Fig 8).
Erythrodermic psoriasis (Fig 9) which is
extensive psoriasis affecting more than
80 % body suface area and generalised
pustular psoriasis (Fig 10) which is
characterised by widespread erythema
studded with superficial pustules should
be referred urgently to a dermatologist.

3. CO-MORBIDITIES
There is increasing evidence that psoriasis
is associated with multiple co-morbidities
especially metabolic syndrome.
3.1. Metabolic Syndrome and Its
Components
There are various definitions of metabolic
syndrome. Definition based on NCEP-ATP
III criteria (original and revised), modified
Asian NCEP-ATP III criteria and WHO
clinical criteria were used in the following
evidence in this section.42, level II-2; 43, level II-2;
44, level III
Prevalence of metabolic syndrome is
increased in psoriasis patients with
significant OR ranging from 1.3 to 5.9.45-
46, level II-2 A population-based study done in
United Kingdom also showed that psoriasis
was associated with metabolic syndrome
(OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.51), and

MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Fig 6: Scalp lesions may

Fig 8: Guttate psoriasis
the association increased with increasing
disease severity, from mild (OR= 1.22,
95% CI 1.11 to1.35) to severe psoriasis
(OR=1.98, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.43).42, level II-2
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome
among 212 psoriasis patients seen at
a local tertiary referral public hospital
was 55.7%, higher when compared with
normal Malaysian population (OR=3.56,
95% CI 2.60 to 4.88).43, level II-2
Patients with psoriasis have increased risk
of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
obesity and smoking. Risk of diabetes
mellitus and obesity were higher in
moderate-severe
compared
to
mild
psoriasis (diabetes: OR=1.4, 95% CI
1.2 to1.6; obesity: OR=1.5 95% CI 1.3
to1.6).14, level II-2 Similarly an Asian study
also showed that increasing BMI was
associated with increasing severity of
psoriasis (p=0.004) particularly in
men (p=0.002).47, level II-2
Metabolic abnormalities associated with
psoriasis include:-
•
Abdominal obesity (OR=1.72, 95% CI
1.03 to 2.86).45, level II-2
•
Hypertriglyceridaemia
(OR=2.08,
95% CI 1.39 to 3.1145, level II-2 and
RR=1.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.720, level II-2).
•
Hypertension (OR ranging from 1.03
to 1.49 46, level II-2; 48, level II-2; 16, level II-2; 13,
level II-2 and RR=1.51 (95% CI 1.47 to
1.5620, level II-2).
•
Diabetes mellitus (OR ranging from
1.13 to 1.4220, level II-2; 46, level II-2; 16, level II-2;
13, level II-2 and RR=1.64,95% CI 1.58 to
1.7020, level II-2).

3.2 Atherosclerosis and Related
Diseases
Psoriasis patients have higher risk of
atherosclerosis with OR of 2.2 (95%
CI 1.6 to 3.0), and atherosclerosisrelated diseases like ischaemic heart
disease (OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.1),
cerebrovascular disease (OR=1.7, 95%
CI 1.3 to 2.2) and peripheral vascular
disease (OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8).12,
level II-2 Severe psoriasis is a risk factor for
major cardiovascular (CV) events like
non-fatal myocardial infarct, non-fatal stroke or death (HR=1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9).
It confers an additional 6.2% absolute risk of 10-year major CV events compared
with the general population.10, level II-2 Patients with severe psoriasis also have a
significant 1.6-fold increase risk of CV mortality and the risk is higher in younger
patients (RR of 2.7 and 1.9 for a 40-year-old and a 60-year-old respectively).11, level II-2
Psoriasis is an independent predictor for non-fatal cardiovascular disease among women,
particularly those diagnosed with psoriasis at <40 years of age (HR=3.26, 95% CI 1.2 to
8.8) and those with longer duration of psoriasis (≥9 years, HR=3.09, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.3)
and concomitant psoriatic arthritis (HR=3.47, 95% CI 1.9 to 6.6).49, level II-2
3.3 Malignancy
Patients with psoriasis have an elevated risk of malignancies (HR=1.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.0)
especially male patients (HR=1.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.3).50, level II-2 The associated malignancies
are cancer of the lips, oropharynx, larynx, liver, gallbladder, colon, peritoneum, rectum,
urinary bladder and malignant melanoma.20, level II-2; 50, level II-2
3.4. Psychiatric co-morbidity
Patients with psoriasis have higher risk of depression (HR=1.39, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.41),
anxiety (HR=1.31, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.34) and suicidality (HR=1.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.6)
especially in severe disease.51, level II-2
3.5 Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease)
Psoriasis is associated with increased risk of ulcerative colitis (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to
2.3).52, level II-2 The risk of Crohn’s disease however varies between countries probably due
to genetic influence. The risk is not observed in Taiwan (RR=0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9),20, level
II-2 but is high in Israel (OR=2.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.6).52, level II-2
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Recommendation 2
•
Assessment of patients with psoriasis should include psychosocial measures and patients
should be referred to mental health services if necessary. (Grade C)
•
Psoriasis patients should be regularly screened for metabolic syndrome and risk factors of
artherosclerosis-related diseases. (Grade C)
•
Patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis should be encouraged to adopt a healthy
lifestyle (regular exercise, maintain healthy body weight [Body Mass Index 18.5 – 24.9],
stop smoking, avoid alcohol or drink alcohol in moderation). (Grade C)
4. TREATMENT
4.1 Principles of Care
The treatment of psoriasis should be based on shared decision between patients and
their healthcare providers (HCPs). Patients should be given adequate information
regarding their disease and current available treatment options. This information should
be reinforced by supplying them with evidence-based patient information leaflets in
appropriate languages to enable them to make informed decision regarding their care.
The goal of treatment is to improve and maintain patients’ health-related quality of life
through control of symptoms and signs of psoriasis. Implementing and regular monitoring
of treatment goals based on disease severity and patients’ preferences are necessary
to ensure long-term effective treatment and to prevent complications from uncontrolled
disease activity. The choice of treatment should be individualised based on patient’s
disease severity, patient’s preference, availlability of treatment and the risk-benefit of
treatment (refer Appendix 3).
•
Management should start with patient education.
•
Treatment should be a combined decision between patients and their healthcare providers.
•
Treatment goals achieved should be monitored regularly to detect loss of response which
may necessitate modification of therapy.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.2 Treatment Goals
The ideal treatment goal would be complete clearance of skin lesions but this is currently
not achievable in most patients. Thus, it is necessary to set a minimal target to allow
modification of therapy if target is not achieved within a set time. (Refer to Table 3).
Treatment goal and minimal target set should be based on disease severity and patient’s
preference.

4.3 Topical therapy
Success of topical therapy is highly dependent on patients’ compliance to treatment.
Compliance is usually better during the early phase of treatment and more likely
when treatment is once daily. It is generally accepted that patients with less than
5% body surface involvement can be treated adequately with topical agents alone.
However, even patients with extensive psoriasis can be effectively treated with
topical therapies provided adequate time for education is given to patient to enhance
compliance and appropriate use.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.3.1 Emollients
Emollients either as soap substitutes or moisturizers are routinely used in the management
of psoriasis although there is no evidence-based data on its benefits. However, one study
demonstrated its steroid-sparing effect when used in combination with betamethasone
dipropionate where control is achieved with less steroid used.53, level I This steroid-sparing
effect is probably due to the ability of emollients to restore normal hydration and epidermal
barrier function.
Recommendation 3
•
Emollients should be used regularly in psoriasis. (Grade C)
4.3.2 Tar- based preparation
There is a lack of good quality evidence on the efficacy of coal tar. In Mason’s Cochrane
review, coal tar was shown to be as efficacious as placebo (SMD= -0.5, 95% CI -1.2
to 0.2 and less efficacious than calcipotriol (SMD= -1.1; 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7).54, level
I However, another systematic review (SR) supported the use of coal tar preparations
whereby 5% liquor carbonis distillate (LCD) showed 48.7% improvement in total severity
score based on erythema, scaling, induration and pruritus at week 4 compared to 35.3 %
improvement in placebo arm.55, level I A new topical LCD 15% solution was more efficacious
than calcipotriene after 12 weeks of treatment [PASI 75: 41% vs 0% (p<0.05)].56, level I
Coal tar is well tolerated and has no significant differences in withdrawals due to adverse
events (RD=0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.12) or treatment failure (RD=0.00; 95% CI -0.06
to 0.06) when compared to calcipotriol.54, level I Although occupational exposure to coal
tar is associated with lung, scrotal and skin cancer, risk of carcinogenicity following
therapeutic use is unknown.57, level III; 58, level II-2 A recent large cohort study of 13,200 patients
with psoriasis and eczema treated with coal tar for a median duration of six months
demonstrated no increased risk of cancer with a HR of 1.1 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.7) for skin
cancer and 0.9 (95% CI 0. 8 to 1.1) for non-skin cancer.58, level II-2
Tar-based preparations may cause staining, irritation and folliculitis. It should not be used on
body-folds, face and genitalia.
Recommendation 4
•
Tar-based preparations may be used as a first-line topical therapy for mild psoriasis.
(Grade A)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.3.3 Topical corticosteroids
Topical corticosteroids are the most widely used agent for treatment of psoriasis and
they are available in a variety of formulations including ointment, cream, gel, lotion, spray
and solution. A Cochrane review demonstrated the efficacy of topical corticosteroids
compared to placebo whereby the standardized mean difference (SMD) for potent
corticosteroids was -0.95 (95% CI -1.11 to -0.80) and very potent corticosteroids was
-1.29 (95% CI -1.45 to -1.13). There were no significant adverse local and systemic
events documented for both potent and very potent corticosteroids. However, duration
of therapy in the included studies was short (2 - 3 weeks for very potent corticosteroids
and 3 - 12 weeks for potent corticosteroids).54, level I Short-term use of topical potent and
very potent corticosteroids had also been demonstrated to be safe in another systematic
review.59, level I
Good quality evidence on the efficacy of medium and low potency corticosteroids in
psoriasis is lacking. Evidence on the choice of formulations or frequency of application for
topical corticosteroid is also scanty but most guidelines recommend once or twice daily
application with tapering of frequency after disease control is achieved.
When topical corticosteroid was used with hydrocolloid dressing, disease clearance increased
by 44% compared to corticosteroids monotherapy. However, combining corticosteroids
and salicylic acid therapy did not increase disease clearance (RD=0.03, 95% CI -0.00 to
0.07). Combining corticosteroids with UVB treatment also did not increase disease clearance
compared to UVB monotherapy (RD= -0.06, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.12).60, level I
Short-term use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroid is efficacious and safe for the
treatment of plaque psoriasis. However, use on extensive lesions or long-term continuous use
may result in skin atrophy and systemic absorption.
Recommendation 5
•
Short-term therapy with potent and very potent topical corticosteroids may be used to gain
rapid clearance in psoriasis patients with limited plaques. (Grade A)
o
These preparations should be avoided on the face, genitalia and body folds. (Grade C)
o Limit use of super potent corticosteroids to less than 30g/week. (Grade C)
o Limit use of potent corticosteroids to less than 60g/week. (Grade C)
•
Continuous use of potent corticosteroids should not exceed four weeks. (Grade C)
•
Continuous use of super potent corticosteroids should not exceed two weeks. (Grade C)
•
Mild potency corticosteroids may be used for face, genitalia and body folds. (Grade C)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.3.4 Dithranol Preparations
Dithranol is more efficacious than placebo (SMD= -1.1, 95% CI -1.7 to -0.5) and as
efficacious as Vitamin D analogues (SMD=0.04, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.61). There was no
significant difference in local or systemic adverse events compared to placebo.54, level I
However, it may irritate surrounding normal skin, causing burning and staining. It has to
be applied accurately to affected plaques to prevent irritation. Hence, it is more suitable
for psoriasis patients with few large chronic thick plaques.
Recommendation 6
•
Dithranol may be used for psoriasis patients with a few large thick plaques. (Grade A)
4.3.5 Topical Vitamin D Analogues
Calcipotriol is the only topical vitamin D analogue available in Malaysia. The Cochrane
review by Mason et al, showed that vitamin D analogue was:54, level I
•
more efficacious than placebo [SMD ranging from -0.8 (95% CI -1.3 to -0.3) to -1.9
(95% CI -2.1 to -1.7)], coal tar (SMD=-1.1, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7) and tacrolimus
(SMD= -0.95, 95% CI -1.55 to -0.34).
•
as efficacious as potent corticosteroids (SMD=0.08, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.24), very
potent corticosteroids (SMD=0.1, 95% CI - 0.6 to 0.8) and dithranol (SMD=0.04,
95% CI -0.53 to 0.61).
There is no difference in systemic adverse events when compared with placebo, potent or
very potent corticosteroids, coal tar and dithranol. Calcipotriol causes more local adverse
events mainly irritation and pruritus compared to potent corticosteroids (RD=0.09, 95%
CI 0.04 to 0.14). It is better tolerated than dithranol (RD= -0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.1)
but this needs to be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity among the
studies. Twice daily calcipotriol was more efficacious than once daily dosing (SMD=-
0.19, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.02).54, level I
The two-compound preparation containing calcipotriol and potent corticosteroids
is more efficacious than either constituent alone (SMD vs corticosteroids alone was
-0.44, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.35 and vs calcipotriol alone was 0.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.6). It
causes less local adverse event compared to calcipotriol alone (RD=0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to
0.09). Although the studies included in this systematic review are of short duration (2 - 3
weeks),54, level I its safety when used on a “as-needed basis” has been demonstrated in a
52 week study.61, level I
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Bailey et al, also showed a similar result whereby topical vitamin D analogue and
corticosteroid combinations resulted in increased disease clearance compared to
topical vitamin D analogue monotherapy (RD=0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3) or corticosteroid
monotherapy (RD=0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.24). However, this effect was dependent on
the potency of the corticosteroids used. There was an increased likelihood of disease
clearance using a potency group 1 corticosteroid combination (RD=0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to
0.4) and a potency group 2 corticosteroid combination (RD of 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to
0.22) compared to topical vitamin D analogue monotherapy. Use of a potency group
3 corticosteroid combination did not lead to increased disease clearance in similar
comparison.60, level I
•
Total amount of calcipotriol used should not exceed 100g/week to avoid hypercalcemia.
•
Potent corticosteroid used in vitamin D analogue and corticosteroid fixed dose combination
may cause local and systemic side-effects.
Recommendation 7
•
Fixed dose combination of topical vitamin D analogue and corticosteroid may be used for
short-term treatment of psoriasis. (Grade A)
•
Topical Vitamin D analogue may be used for treatment of psoriasis. (Grade A)
4.3.6 Calcineurin inhibitors
Pimecrolimus 1% cream is efficacious and well-tolerated when used for the treatment
of facial and flexural psoriasis. In the Cochrane review by Mason et al, Pimecrolimus 1%
cream is more efficacious than placebo in treating flexural psoriasis (SMD=1.1, 95% CI
-1.7 to -0.5).54, level I Another study documented a 74.3% improvement (p<0.005) in total
symptom score after 8-week treatment with pimecrolimus twice daily.62, level II-3 Both studies
showed no significant differences in term of local or systemic side-effects.54, level I; 62, level II-3
A multicentre, double-blind vehicle-controlled study demonstrated that tacrolimus 0.1%
ointment is efficacious and well-tolerated when used for flexural and facial psoriasis.
Excellent improvement in PGA score was achieved in 66.7% in tacrolimus group and only
36.8% in the vehicle (p=0.002).63, level I However, tacrolimus has limited efficacy for the rest
of body (SMD=0.1, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.6),54, level I unless when used in combination with 6%
salicylic acid leading to significant improvement in erythema, scale, and pruritus but not
thickness score.64, level I
Topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are efficacious for face and flexures psoriasis but not
licensed for the treatment of psoriasis.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.3.7 Topical Salicylic Acid
The same Cochrane review as above showed that 2% salicylic acid alone (SMD= -0.96,
95% CI -1.89 to -0.02) or in combination with betamethasone diproprionate (SMD= -1.7,
95% CI -2.7 to -0.6) or with betamethasone valerate and tretinoin (SMD= -0.76, 95% CI
-1.21 to -0.31) is more efficacious than placebo. Combination of 6% salicylic acid with
betamethasone diproprionate is as efficacious as calcipotriol (SMD= -0.05, 95%CI -0.26
to 0.15).54, level I
Recommendation 8
•
Topical salicylic acid may be used for plaque psoriasis. (Grade A)
4.4 Phototherapy
Phototherapy is indicated for patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. It
includes ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), red light, blue light and excimer laser. UVA
is delivered in combination with a photosensitizing agent (psoralen) in oral, topical or bath
form. Different wavelengths of UVB may be used eg narrowband (NBUVB), broad band
(BBUVB) or selective band (SELUVB).
The efficacy of NBUVB is comparable to SELUVB, complete clearance is achieved in 56%
vs 40% of patients. NBUVB is more effective than BBUVB, whereby PASI 60 was achieved
in 84% patients treated with NBUVB compared to 38% (p<0.01) treated with BBUVB.65,
level I The predictors of good response to NBUVB therapy are lower baseline PASI, a previous
course of NBUVB, higher minimal erythema dose (MED) and lower body weight. Longer
duration of remission is observed in patients who require fewer numbers of exposures
to achieve clearance.66, level II-2 High dose (70% MED) and low dose (35% MED) NBUVB
are both efficacious, but lower dose requires more treatment sessions (20.6±6.9 vs
24.1±6.1 sessions, p<0.05).67, level I NBUVB treatment given twice a week or thrice a week
has the same efficacy, however twice a week therapy requires longer treatment duration
(PASI reduction 11.1±4.1 vs 11.9±3.6, p=0.29, duration of treatment 88 (48 - 150)
days vs 58 (32 - 112) days, p<0.00).68, level I Topical psoralen combined with NBUVB has
greater efficacy than NBUVB alone (PASI reduction of 58.6% vs 37.7%, p=0.043).69, level I
Oral PUVA has greater clinical response than NBUVB (complete clearance: OR=3.04, 95%
CI 1.18 to 7.84,65, level I and clearance rate: OR=2.79, 95% CI 1.40 to 5.55,70, level I). The
number of sessions and cumulative dose are lower with oral PUVA compared to NBUVB
(16.7 - 19.0 vs 25.3 - 28.5 sessions, p<0.05,65, level I 12.7 vs 16.4 sessions, p<0.05,71, level
II-1 and cumulative dose of 70.1 - 126.0 vs 35.0 - 41.3 J/cm2, p<0. 001,65, level I 7.4 vs 1.1
J/cm2, p<0.05).71, level II-1 Oral PUVA provides better remission rate at 6 months (OR=2.73;
95% CI 1.18 to 6.27) and a longer duration of remission than NBUVB.70, level I
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
NBUVB is superior to bath PUVA (PASI score, 17.5 vs 20.0, p=0.044), number of
treatment required for clearance (19.0 vs 24.5, p=0.014) and the duration for clearance
(p=0.0014).72, level I The efficacy of cream PUVA is similar to NBUVB.65, level I
A meta-analysis of 3 studies showed no significant difference in efficacy between initial
PUVA dose according to minimal phototoxic dose compared to initial PUVA dose according
to skin-type. PUVA therapy twice per week compared with thrice per week is equally
efficacious, but number of sessions required for clearance is significantly less with thrice
per week regime (p<0.0001) and cumulative dose for clearance is also significantly less
(p<0.001).70, level I
There is no evidence on the practice of maintenance phototherapy.
PUVA is associated with an increased risk of photoaging, lentigines and skin cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common skin cancer encountered and the
risk increases with higher number of exposures. The risk for basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
is only seen with very high number of PUVA exposures. A significant risk for melanoma
is only seen 15 years after first exposure to PUVA and the risk is also dose dependent.
Among patients treated with PUVA, the risk for invasive scrotal and penile SCC is high
(RR= 81.7, 95% CI 52.1 to 122.6).73, level I There is an increased incidence of cataract in
patients exposed to PUVA compared to the population but the relationship to the level of
PUVA exposure is conflicting.74, level I
Excimer laser is efficacious in limited plaque psoriasis (PASI 75 ranging from 54 to 84%)
although studies are done on small number of patients.75, level II-2; 76, level II-3 Blisters (45.2
- 92.3%), hyperpigmentation (37.9 - 100%), erythema (50.8 - 69.2%) and pruritus
(84.6%) are the common side effects.75, level II-2 There is no good evidence for blue and red
light therapy in psoriasis.
Recommendation 9
•
Phototherapy 2 - 3 sessions/week may be offered to patients with moderate to severe
plaque psoriasis. (Grade A)
•
Phototherapy should not exceed >200 sessions for PUVA or >350 sessions for UVB. (Grade C)
4.5 Systemic Therapy
The majority of patients with psoriasis have mild disease which can be adequately controlled
with topical therapy. However patients with moderate to severe psoriasis frequently require
systemic or biologic therapy. Systemic agents such as methotrexate, acitretin and cyclosporine
have significant side-effects and cumulative toxicity while long-term safety data on biologics
is still limited. Therefore, pre-treatment assessment of patients for systemic / biologic is
important to identify those at risk of developing toxicity. Laboratory / imaging tests should be
done at baseline and regularly, to monitor for side effects / toxicity.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Recommendation 10
•
All patients for systemic / biologic therapy should have a pre-treatment assessment
including laboratory / imaging tests and regular monitoring for side effects / toxicity*.
(Grade C)
*Refer to Appendix 7
4.5.1 Methotrexate
Methotrexate is an analogue of folic acid which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. It is a
frequently used systemic agent for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
Methotrexate is efficacious in treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In a
meta-analysis on efficacy of systemic therapy by Bansback et al, PASI 75 at week 16
was achieved in 42% of patients on methotrexate (15 - 22.5mg/week) with a RR of
9.8 (95% CI 6.08 to 13.19) and NNT of 3.77, level I In a separate study, 70% of patients
taking methotrexate 15 to 20mg/week achieved PASI 75 at week 12. There was no
benefit in increasing the dose of methotrexate from 20 to 25mg/week in patients
who failed to achieve PASI 50 at week 12.78, level I A lower percentage of patients
taking methotrexate (15 - 22.5mg/week) achieved PASI 75 at week 16 compared to
cyclosporine (60.5% vs 71.4%) but the difference was not significant (p=0.09).79,
level I Methotrexate was comparable to mycophenolate mofetil (73.3% vs. 58.8% of
patients achieved PASI 75 at week 12, p>0.05). However, this open-label study
involved only 32 patients.80, level I Methotrexate was superior to hydroxycarbamide
as shown in a RCT with PASI 75 at week 12 of 66.7% and 13.3% respectively
(p<0.05).81, level I
Methotrexate is associated with adverse events such as hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression,
gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, loss of appetite), hair loss and
malaise.82, level I The prevalence and severity of side-effects is dependent on dosing regime.
In Schmitt’s meta-analysis on safety and tolerability of biologic and non-biologic, adverse
events were found in 17.7% of patients taking methotrexate but none were serious.
However, withdrawal due to adverse events was seen in 7.3% of patients. The most
common cause of withdrawal was hepatic adverse events.83, level I In a separate study,
common gastrointestinal side effects were nausea (8%), diarrhoea (6%) and abdominal
pain (3%).84, level I Documented incidence of liver fibrosis ranged from 5.7% to 71.8%.
Significant risk factors for liver fibrosis are type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR=7.7, 95%CI 2.7
to 21.7) and obesity (OR=2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.4). Alcohol consumption (OR=1.7, 95%
CI 0.9 to 3.5) and viral hepatitis (OR=5.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 33.5) were not significant risk
factors.85, level I
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Most data on myelosuppression with methotrexate are derived from patients with
rheumatoid arthritis. The real risk of myelosuppression in psoriasis patients is unknown
even though literature suggested that the risk is relatively low in appropriately monitored
patients without risk factors.
Risk factors for methotrexate induced hematotoxicity
•
Renal insufficiency
•
Advanced age
•
Lack of folate supplementation
•
Medication errors
•
Drug interactions
•
Hypoalbuminemia
•
Excessive alcohol intake
Monitoring of hepatotoxicity in patients taking methotrexate vary in different centres.
These methods range from regular serum liver function test to liver biopsy. It has been
a routine to do liver biopsy after a cumulative methotrexate dose of 1.5g and therafter
at 1.0 to 1.5g interval to monitor methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. Recent data
showed that the risk of developing liver fibrosis is less than 2.6% in low risk patients
taking a cumulative methotrexate dose of >4g. Hence liver biopsy may be deferred till a
cumulative dose of ≥4g.86, level II-3; 87, level II-3
Non-invasive methods to monitor hepatotoxicity such as serum procollagen III
aminopeptide (sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 91.5%), fibrotest (sensitivity 83%, specificity
61%) and fibroscan (sensitivity 50%, specificity 88%) are not widely available in Malaysia.
A liver biopsy can be deferred if the level of procollagen III aminopeptide remains within
the normal limits.85, level I
Risk factors for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity
•
Diabetes mellitus
•
Obesity
•
History of or current alcohol consumption
•
Persistent abnormal liver function test
•
History of liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B or C
•
Family history of inheritable liver disease
•
History of significant exposure to hepatotoxic drugs or chemicals
•
Lack of folate supplementation
•
Hyperlipidemia
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid is an effective measure to reduce hepatic
adverse effects (ARR= -0.4, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2). However there is no significant
reduction in gastrointestinal (ARR= -0.09, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.02), mucosal and cutaneous
(ARR= -0.07,95% CI -0.2 to 0.04) or haematological side effects (ARR=0.004, 95% CI
-0.02 to 0.03).82, level I
Data on the risk of pulmonary fibrosis in psoriasis patients on long-term methotrexate
is limited. Pulmonary fibrosis was not documented in a study of 27 psoriatic arthritis
patients on low dose methotrexate (5 -15mg/week) with average treatment period
of 52 months (3 - 240 months).88, level II-2 However, a systematic review reported 84
cases of lung related adverse event (AEs) in 3463 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
on methotrexate, but only 15 of which were felt to be directly caused by methotrexate
(incidence 0.43%). It is prudent to look for pulmonary fibrosis in psoriasis patients on
long-term methotrexate.89, level I
Methotrexate treatment regime and monitoring in patients with psoriasis
Initial therapy
•
Start with oral test dose of 5.0 - 7.5mg /week
•
Supplement with folic acid 5mg od (except the day of methotrexate) or 5mg once a week
(the day after methotrexate)
•
Repeat full blood count (FBC), liver function test (LFT) and renal profile (RP) within 2 weeks
Maintenance therapy
•
Escalate dose from 7.5mg/week till clinical response (maximum 20mg/week)
[administered as a single dose or divided into 3 doses and administered at 12-h intervals
over 2 consecutive days]
•
Monitor FBC/LFT/RP
o
Every 1 to 2 weeks during dose escalation
o
Monthly for the first 3 months
o
Subsequently every 1 to 3 month
•
Do blood test 5 - 7 days after last dose of methotrexate
•
Monitor cumulative dose of methotrexate
o
Consider procollagen III aminopeptide / fibroscan / fibrotest / liver biopsy when total
cumulative dose reach 3.5 to 4.0g in patients without risk factors for hepatotoxicity
or 1.0 to 1.5g for those with risk factors for hepatotoxicity*
*Refer to yellow box on “Risk factors for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity”
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Recommendation 11
•
Methotrexate should be used as first-line systemic treatment for moderate to severe
plaque psoriasis. (Grade A)
•
Neutropaenia and hepatotoxicity should be closely monitored. (Grade C)
4.5.2 Retinoids (Acitretin)
Retinoids are vitamin A analogues which modulate epidermal proliferation and
differentiation. Oral retinoids have been used for a very long time for the treatment of
psoriasis. The first published study on etretinate was in 1984. No good RCTs assessing
efficacy of oral retinoids were available. A study in 1989 comparing etretinate and acitretin
documented mean PASI improvement of 70.8% vs 75.8%.90, level I
A study on adverse effects of acitretin by Pearce et al, showed low dose acitretin (<25mg/
day) had less adverse effects compared to high dose acitretin (>25mg/day). The sideeffects were chelitis, skin peeling, pruritus, alopecia, dry mouth, xerophtalmia, and raised
alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and triglycerides.91, level I
When phototherapy is not an option, acitretin is an appropriate alternative treatment for HIV
patients with psoriasis as it does not cause immunosuppression.92, level III
Acitretin treatment regime and monitoring in patients with psoriasis
Initial therapy
•
Baseline lipid profile and LFTs
•
Start with 0.5 – 1mg/kg/day for 2 - 4 weeks
Maintenance therapy
•
Adjust dose according to response, usually within range of 25 - 50mg daily (maximum
75mg daily).
•
Repeat lipid profile and LFTs every 4 - 8 weeks during dose escalation, then every 12 weeks
*in rare cases of use in women of childbearing age, a baseline pregnancy test should be done and
repeated monthly
Recommendation 12
•
Acitretin may be offered for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. (Grade A)
•
Acitretin should be avoided in women of childbearing age without reliable contraception
and in those who are planning pregnancy. However, it is safe for men who are planning to
have a child. (Grade C)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.5.3 Cyclosporine
Cyclosporine is an oral calcineurin inhibitor. Efficacy of cyclosporine in treating moderate
to severe plaque psoriasis had been demonstrated by Schmitt et al, (PASI 75= 28% to
97% at week 8 to16, RD=0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5).83, level I In another meta-analysis, PASI
75 was achieved in 33% of patients on cyclosporine 3mg/kg/day (RR=7.6, 95% CI 3.7
to 11.7, NNT=4).77, level I
Adverse events (16.1%), serious adverse events (2.3%) and withdrawal due to adverse
events (1.2%) were documented in patients taking cyclosporine.83, level I In a 5-year
cohort study on the risk of malignancy in psoriasis patients on cyclosporine, risk of nonmelanoma skin malignancies was higher among patients treated for more than 2 years
(SIR >2 years=11.4, 95% CI 5.2 to 21.7 vs SIR <2 years=4.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 8.1).
Previous exposure to PUVA increased the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (RR=7.3,
95% CI 1.3 to 134.5).93, level III; 28, level II-2,
Cyclosporine treatment regime and monitoring in patients with psoriasis
Initial therapy
•
Ensure normal baseline investigation (refer appendix 7) prior to cyclosporine
•
Discuss benefit & risk of cyclosporine with patient
•
Starting dose of 2.5mg/kg/d divided twice a day
Maintenance therapy
•
Escalate dose every 4 to 6 weeks till clinical response (maximum 5mg/kg/day)
•
Monitoring while on therapy:
o
Blood pressure, RP, FBC, lipids, LFT, serum bilirubin,and magnesium monitored monthly
Recommendation 14
•
Cyclosporine may be offered as short-term treatment for rapid disease clearance in
moderate to severe psoriasis. (Grade A)
•
Cyclosporine may be offered as second-line systemic agent to psoriasis patients who fail,
intolerant or have contraindications to methotrexate. (Grade A)
o
Cyclosporine should NOT be used for more than 2 years. (Grade B)
o Cyclosporine should be avoided in patient with previous PUVA exposure. (Grade B)
•
Blood pressure, renal function, lipid profile should be monitored closely in psoriasis
patients on cyclosporine. (Grade C)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.5.4 Mycophenolate Mofetil
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immune modulator which inhibits inositol
monophosphate dehydrogenase. MMF (2g daily) is less efficacious than cyclosporine
(2.5mg/kg body weight/day) with PASI 75 at week 12 of 12% and 29% respectively
(p=0.01).94, level I Mean PASI improvement is also lower in MMF (30mg/kg/day) compared
to cyclosporine (4mg/kg/day) (p=0.04). The tolerability and adverse events between the
two drugs are similar.95, level I
4.5.5 Antibiotics
There is no good evidence to support the use of antibiotics in treating plaque psoriasis.95,
level I; 96, level I
4.5.6 Hydroxyurea
Hydroxyurea is an anti-metabolite agent which inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid. There are no
good quality studies to determine the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea. In a prospective
observational study, hydroxyurea 500mg twice daily was an efficacious alternative
treatment for patients with chronic plaque psoriasis where 76% of patients achieved PASI
75 at week 10 to 12. Adverse events reported were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, skin
infection, dry skin, diffuse reversible alopecia and anaemia. Post-inflammatory lesional
and nail hyperpigmentation were seen in all patients taking hydroxyurea.97, level I
4.5.7 Salozopyrin (Sulfasalazine)
Salazopyrin is a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor which has anti-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory effect. Its efficacy in treating psoriatic arthritis had been shown in
several RCTs conducted in 1990s.98, level I However the evidence on the use of salazopyrin
in treating plaque psoriasis is limited. In a small double-blind RCT, salazopyrin (1.5g
to 4.0g) was shown to be more efficacious than placebo [psoriatic severity: marked
improvement 41% vs 0%, moderate improvement 41% vs 4%]. There was a 26% drop
out rate at the end of week 8 in salazopyrin arm due to rash or nausea.99, level I
4.5.8 Leflunomide
Leflunomide is a dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase inhibitor which is a key enzyme in the
de novo synthesis of pyrimidine. There is limited RCT on the efficacy of leflunomide
although several small, uncontrolled studies suggested its efficacy in treating patients
with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.98, level I, 100-101, level I; 102; level II-1 In a double blind placebo
controlled RCT, leflunomide was more efficacious than placebo (PASI 75 17.4% vs 7.8%,
p=0.048, Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) 58.9% vs 9.7%, p<0.0001)
at week 24. In the same study, leflunomide was associated with higher incidences of
diarrhea (24%), increased alanine transaminase level (12.5%) and lethargy (6.3%).103, level I

MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.6.1 Efficacy
There are strong and consistent evidences on the efficacy of biologics in the treatment of
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.104, level I; 77, level I, 83, level I, 105, level I Summary of the dosing
schedule and efficacy of various biologics available in Malaysia is in Table 4.
a. Infliximab
Efficacy is demonstrated in three meta-analyses for infliximab (5mg/kg) versus placebo
with 75.5% to 87.9% patients achieving PASI 75 at week 10 and significant RR of 17.4
to 22.6.104, level I; 77, level I; 105, level I Another meta-analysis reported a RD of 0.8 (95% CI 0.7
to 0.8) between infliximab and placebo at week 10.83, level I Two studies reported NNT of
1 in achieving PASI 75.106,level I, 77, level I In RESTORE-1 trial, infliximab 5mg/kg was more
efficacious than methotrexate 15mg/week (PASI 75 at week 16, 77.8% vs 41.9%,
p<0.001).84, level I However, loss of efficacy was observed at week 50 (PASI 75=61%).
Efficacy is better sustained in patients on continuous compared to intermittent therapy
(PASI 75 at week 50 was 54.5% vs 38.1%).107, level I It took an average of 14 - 16 weeks
to achieve PASI 50 from baseline on re-starting treatment in patients on intermittent
therapy.108, level I
b. Ustekinumab
Ustekinumab either 45mg [for body weight (BW) ≤100kg] or 90mg (for BW >100kg)
is significantly more efficacious than placebo with 69% (RR=19.5) and 74%
(RR=20.9) of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 12 respectively.104, level I In ACCEPT
trial, ustekinumab 45mg or 90mg was significantly more efficacious than etanercept
50mg twice a week with PASI 75 achievement at week 12 was 67.5%, 73.8% and
56.8% respectively.109, level I
c. Adalimumab
Two meta-analyses showed adalimumab 40mg is more efficacious than placebo
with 58% (RR=16.5) and 71% (RR=16.7) of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 12
to 16.104, level I; 77, level I It is supported by another meta-analysis which demonstrated a
RD of 0.64 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.68) at week 16.83, level I Two studies reported NNT of 1
to achieve PASI 75.110, level I; 77, level I In CHAMPION trial, adalimumab 40mg had been
shown to be more efficacious than methotrexate (7.5 to 25mg/week) and placebo
in achieving PASI 75 at week 16 (79.6% vs 35.5% vs 18.9%; p<0.001).78, level I
Open-label extension study for patients from REVEAL demonstrated that continuous
adalimumab up to 3 years was still safe and efficacious with PASI 75 achievement at
week 16 of 76% among the initial responders.79, level I
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
d. Etanercept
Efficacy of etanercept had been demonstrated in three meta-analysis and the response
was dose related. Etanercept 50mg twice a week showed better efficacy than etanercept
25mg twice a week with PASI 75 achievement at week 12 of 47% to 54% (RR of 11.7 to
14.7) and 30% to 39% (RR of 10.2 to 10.9) respectively when compared with placebo.104,
level I; 77, level I; 105, level I Another meta-analysis reported RD of 0.30 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.35) for
etanercept 25mg twice a week and 0.44 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.48) for etanercept 50mg
twice a week when compared with placebo at week 12.83, level I Two studies reported NNT
of 2 for etanercept 50mg twice weekly and NNT of 3 for etanercept 25mg twice a week
in achieving PASI 75.110, level I; 77, level I There is a further increase in the efficacy of etanercept
after the induction phase of 16 weeks with maximal efficacy to be reached after 18 to 24
weeks. It was demonstrated that etanercept 25mg twice a week resulted in PASI 75 of
34% at week 12 and 44% at week 24 whereas etanercept 50mg twice a week showed
PASI 75 of 49% at week 12 and 59% at week 24.111, level I

4.6.2 Safety
Biologics are associated with adverse events of which some are serious and life
threatening. These include opportunistic infections, reactivation of tuberculosis,
malignancy, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disease, injection/infusion reactions,
hematological disturbances, hepatotoxicity, development of auto antibodies, and lupus
like reaction.
In a Cochrane systematic review by Singh et al, in 2011, biologics were associated with
higher rate of total adverse events (TAEs) [OR=1.2, 95%CI 1.1 to1.3], withdrawals due
to AEs [OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to1.6] and an increased risk of tuberculosis reactivation
(OR=4.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 18.6). There was no significant difference in terms of severe
adverse events (SAEs), serious infection, lymphoma and congestive cardiac failure.113,
level I The risk of tuberculosis (TB) was higher with monoclonal antibodies, adalimumab
[144 events per 100000 person-years (pyrs)] and infliximab (136 per 100000 pyrs), as
compared with etanercept (39 per 100000 pyrs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
reported to the BSRBR (British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register).114, level II-2
Registry data from BIOBADASER (Spanish Society of Rheumatology Database on Biologic
Products) demonstrated effectiveness of 9 months isoniazid prophylactic therapy in
preventing reactivation of latent TB infection for patients receiving tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) antagonists. Active TB rate in BIOBADASER patients was 20.9-fold higher (95%
CI 12.0 to 36.8) than in the background Spanish population before implementation
of prophylactic isoniazid therapy as compared to 4.7-fold (95% CI 0.5 to18.9) after
implementation of this recommendation. There was a decrease in active TB rates by 78%
among the BIOBADASER patients following this recommendation with incidence risk ratio
(IRR) of 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.88).115, level II-2
A small case series found that anti-TNF alpha (infliximab more than etanercept and
adalimumab) induced reactivation of hepatitis B in psoriasis patients with positive
hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg +ve) and less frequently in patients with isolated
positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-Hbc +ve). This can be prevented with appropriate
anti-viral therapy, thus hepatitis B in psoriasis is not an absolute contraindication to the
use of anti -TNF alpha.116, level III
a. Infliximab
The meta-analysis by Singh et al, showed that Infliximab was associated with higher
risk of TAEs (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) and withdrawals due to AEs (OR=2.0, 95% CI
1.4 to 2.9).113, level I Another meta-analysis confirmed that Infliximab was associated with
higher AEs (RR=1.2, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.3) but not SAEs (RR=1.3, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.8).
Common AEs were acute infusion reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, headache
and increased hepatic enzymes.105, level I
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
b. Ustekinumab
In the PHOENIX-1 and 2 trials, the risk of AEs was comparable between ustekinumab
45mg, ustekinumab 90mg and placebo (53.1% to 57.3%, 47.9% to 51.4% and 48.2%
to 49.8% respectively). There was no difference in SAEs among the three arms (0.8%
to 2.0%, 1.2% to 1.6%, and 0.8% to 2.0% respectively). In general, AEs reported were
mild such as upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, nasopharyngitis,
headache and arthralgia.117, level I; 118, level I
c. Adalimumab
Adalimumab was associated with higher risk of TAEs (OR=1.2, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.6) but
without increase in withdrawal (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.5) when compared to placebo.
Common AEs were injection site reaction, infection (e.g. upper respiratory infection),
dizziness and headache.113, level I
d. Etanercept
Compared to placebo, etanercept showed no significant TAEs (OR=1.2, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.4)
or withdrawal due to AEs (OR=1.3, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.8).113, level I Common AEs documented
were injection site reaction, headache and upper respiratory tract infection.105, level I

4.6.3 Cost- Effectiveness
The use of biologics in treating psoriasis is limited by its high costs. Hence various
studies had been carried out in different countries to investigate the cost-effectiveness of
biologics and economic impact of psoriasis. However, there is no local study evaluating
the cost effectiveness of different biologics agent in Malaysia.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
A retrospective cohort study in Netherlands showed higher mean total direct costs in the
biologic period compared to the pre-biologic period [€17712, 95% CI €15004 to €20 421
vs €10146, 95% CI €7614 to €12 678 per patient per year (PPPY)]. This difference was
attributed to the cost of biologics. However the use of biologics significantly decreased
the direct costs related to day-care admission (pre and post biologic cost: €1167 PPPY vs
€60 PPPY) and hospitalization (€6738 PPPY vs €1475 PPPY).119, level II-2
Another study in United Kingdom (UK) showed a significant decrease in mean annual
hospital care costs by £1682 (p=0.028) even though the mean annual drug cost was
increased by £9456 (p<0.001) following commencement of biologics.120, level II-2
Adalimumab was the most cost-effective biologic in Swiss healthcare system for PASI
75 at week 12 with lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CHF 14 921
followed by Infliximab (CHF 16 505) and etanercept (CHF 25 748). For ICER per PASI 90
at week 12, Infliximab was most cost effective with lowest ICER of CHF 22995 followed
by adalimumab (CHF 34 815) and etanercept (CHF 59 407).121, level I
Similar result were demonstrated in the Spanish National Health System, the most cost
effective biologics in terms of cost per PASI 75 responder was adalimumab (ICER €8013
at week 16) followed by etanercept 25mg twice a week (ICER €9110 at week 12),
usteknumab 45mg (ICER €9627 at week 12), infliximab 5mg/kg (ICER €10 523 at week
10), etanercept 50mg twice a week (ICER €12797 at week 12) and ustekinumab 90mg
(ICER €17981 at week 12).122, level I
The expected cost and benefit, expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), were estimated
for biologics from National Health Service (NHS) data. Adalimumab was most cost-effective
(ICER £30 000 per QALY) followed by etanercept (£37 000 per QALY) and infliximab (£42 000
per QALY).123, level I However, these health economic studies do not measure the cost-benefits
derived from the prevention of disease-related morbidity and mortality such as depression,
joint deformities and cardiovascular disease.

MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.7 Various Combinations
Combination therapies are frequently used in clinical practice for the treatment of
psoriasis.60, level I Limited data documented better efficacy, tolerability and fewer adverse
events for combination therapies.124-125, level III Systemic treatments are sometimes combined
for variable time periods to achieve an additive or synergistic effect. Dosages of the individual
agents may then be reduced to minimise adverse effects.124, level III Evidence on combinations
using vitamin D derivatives, vitamin A derivatives (retinoid), UVB and corticosteroid
presented in this subchapter are based on the meta-analysis by Bailey et al.60, level I
4.7.1 Vitamin D analogues Combination
Combined vitamin D analogues and phototherapy treatment cleared psoriasis
better than vitamin D analogues monotherapy (RD=0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5) but not when
compared to UVB monotherapy (RD= 0.07, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.2).60, level I
Recommendation 15
•
Topical vitamin D analogue and ultraviolet B phototherapy combination may be used for
treatment of psoriasis. (Grade A)
4.7.2 Vitamin A analogues (retinoids) Combination
Retinoids and PUVA combinations led to improved disease clearance compared to oral
retinoids monotherapy (RD=0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.7) and PUVA monotherapy (RD=0.22,
95% CI 0.07 to 0.38).60, level I
Both oral and topical retinoids combination with topical corticosteroid produced
better disease clearance when compared to retinoid monotherapy (RD=0.2, 95% CI
0.1 to 0.3). There was insufficient data to compare the efficacy of this combination
with topical corticosteroid monotherapy. Retinoids and UVB combination resulted in
better disease clearance than UVB monotherapy (RD=0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.36).
However, when a study using acitretin was removed from the analysis, this effect lost
its statistical significance, suggesting better efficacy only when systemic retinoid and
UVB combination is used.60, level I
Recommendation 16
• Acitretin and ultraviolet B phototherapy combination may be offered to patients with
inadequate response to ultraviolet B monotherapy in psoriasis. (Grade A)
•
Acitretin and PUVA combination may be offered to patients with inadequate response to
PUVA in psoriasis. (Grade A)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.7.3 Ultraviolet B (UVB) Combination
Based on two small RCTs in the systematic review, the use of UVB-methotrexate
combination therapy had better clearance compared to UVB monotherapy (RD=0.4,
95% CI 0.1 to 0.6). However, UVB combinations with balneotherapy, psoralen or tar
did not increase the likelihood of achieving disease clearance when compared to UVB
monotherapy.60, level I
Ultraviolet B phototherapy and tar-based preparation combination has no additional benefit
compared with ultraviolet B phototherapy alone.
4.7.4 Etanercept Combination
In a systematic review by Foley et al, two RCTs showed superior PGA ratings for
patients on combination of etanercept and methotrexate. The RCT by Zachariae et al,
showed that the proportion of patients judged as ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ according
to the PGA at week 24 was superior for etanercept with continued methotrexate
treatment compared with etanercept ⁄ methotrexate taper (66.7% vs 37.0%, p=0.03).
While Moore et al study, the OR of achieving ‘clear’, ‘almost clear’, or ‘mild’ on the
PGA scale with concomitant etanercept 50mg biweekly and methotrexate therapy
was 2.3 at week 12 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.0) compared with etanercept monotherapy. The
HR estimate for AEs was similar for both groups.126, level I
PASI 75 was achieved by 45% of patients on etanercept 25mg twice weekly, 30% of
patients on acitretin 0.4mg/kg daily and 44% of patients treated with etanercept (25mg
once a week) / acitretin (0.4mg/kg/day) combination at week 24 (p=0.001 for both
etanercept groups compared with acitretin alone).126, level I Although once weekly etanercept/
acitretin daily combination was as efficacious as biweekly etanercept monotherapy, larger
trial was required to confirm the finding.
PASI 75 was achieved by 90% of the etanercept 25mg twice a week and narrowband
UVB combination group compared to 40% of the etanercept monotherapy group at week
12.126, level I
Recommendation 17
The following combination may be used to improve disease clearance in patients with moderate
to severe psoriasis:-
•
Etanercept / methotrexate combination. (Grade A)
•
Etanercept / narrow band Ultraviolet B phototherapy combination.(Grade A)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
4.8 Adjunctive Therapy
There is no good quality evidence to recommend adjunctive therapy such as traditional
Chinese medicine, herbal treatment, psychological intervention or dietary supplement.
Although there is no retrievable evidence on the role of anti-histamines in the treatment
of psoriasis, anti-histamine is useful in treating associated pruritus.
Recommendation 18
• Anti-histamines should be offered for the treatment of pruritus in patients with psoriasis. (Grade C)
5. SPECIAL CONDITIONS
5.1 Treatment of Psoriasis in Pregnancy
Psoriasis improves in 55%, worsen in 23% and remains static in 21% of patient during
pregnancy.17 Psoriasis frequently flares in the immediate post-partum period. Although
there are many modalities of treatment, safety data for the use of these therapies in
pregnant and lactating women is limited. Safety data are mainly from case reports, or
observational studies and post-marketing surveillance reports.
In managing psoriasis in pregnant and lactating women, drug chosen should confer
benefit to the mother and pose minimal risk to the foetus. The FDA-assigned pregnancy
categories as used in the Drug Formulary are as follows:
Category
Interpretation
A
Controlled human studies show no risk
Controlled studies in pregnant women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester
with no evidence of risk in later trimesters. The possibility of fetal harm appears remote.
B
No evidence of risk in studies
Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but there are no controlled
studies in pregnant women, or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other
than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first
trimester and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters
C
Risk cannot be ruled out
Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus (teratogenic or embryocidal
effects or other) and there are no controlled studies in women, or studies in women and animals
are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk
to the fetus.
D
Positive evidence of risk
There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant women may
be acceptable despite the risk (eg, if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a
serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).
X
Contraindicated in pregnancy
Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is evidence
of fetal risk based on human experience, or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant
women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are
or may become pregnant.
N
FDA has not classified this drug
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
5.1.1 Topical Agents
a. Emollients
The use of emollients is safe.127-129, level III
b. Topical Corticosteroids
A Cochrane review of observational studies on topical corticosteroids of various
potencies showed no significant adverse event in pregnancy outcomes. However, high
potency corticosteroids particularly on large body surface areas should be used with
caution because of the possibility of low birth weight baby.130, level II-2
c. Tar-Based preparations and Anthralin
Tar-based preparations are found to be teratogenic in animals at doses that caused
maternal toxicity. However there is insufficient data to enable an accurate estimate of
teratogenic risk to be made in humans. Short-term use of topical coal tar is probably safe
in second and third trimester of pregnancy.128, level III
There is no information on the use of anthralin (dithranol) during pregnancy in humans or
animals. Since there is no evidence of systemic absorption, dithranol is considered safe
in pregnancy.128-129, level III
d. Calcipotriol Analogues
Use of calcipotriol is to be avoided in pregnancy because of systemic absorption.127-128,
level III Animal studies showed increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities, incomplete
ossification of pubic bones and forelimb phalanges of foetuses.131, level III Nevertheless, use
of topical calcipotriol during pregnancy at recommended doses (<100g/week) is unlikely
to be associated with a high risk of teratogenicity. Although there is no published data on
the reproductive or teratogenic effect on humans, use beyond the recommended doses
may be teratogenic.129, level III
e. Tacrolimus
Tacrolimus is effective in the treatment of facial and intertriginous psoriasis. Systemic
absorption of tacrolimus after topical administration is very low. Blood concentrations of
tacrolimus in patients with atopic dermatitis treated topically are 7 to 17 times lower than
those observed in transplantation recipients after oral administration. Hence risk of
teratogenicity is likely low if tacrolimus is used for limited disease although there is no
published human data.129, level III
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
f. Salicylic acid
Topical salicylic acid is not recommended as studies are limited and topical absorption
can be substantial.131, level III
5.1.2 Phototherapy
Both NBUVB128-129, level III; 1131-32, level III and BBUVB131-132, level IIII are safe in pregnancy.
Insufficient evidence exists on the safety of PUVA in pregnancy but in view of the
mutagenic potential of PUVA, it is not recommended for use in pregnancy.128, level III; 132,
level III Even though there was no documented increase rate of congenital anomalies, an
increase number of low-birth weight infants was noted in patients who are treated with
PUVA.132, level III; 127-128, level III
5.1.3 Systemic Agents
The availability of systemic therapies for psoriasis in pregnancy is limited. Only two drugs;
cyclosporine and corticosteroids are considered to be relatively safe but have to be used
with caution.
a. Cyclosporine
Based on studies of pregnant transplant patients who were treated with cyclosporine (C),
the rate of congenital anomalies shows no difference from that expected in the general
population.127-129, level III However increased incidence of prematurity and intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR) had been reported.129, level III; 131, level III
b. Systemic Corticosteroids
Systemic corticosteroids are infrequently used for treatment of psoriasis except in pregnancyinduced generalised pustular psoriasis. Long-term effects on growth, neurodevelopment
and social-emotional functioning have not been associated with exposure to a single course
of corticosteroids during pregnancy. Although long-term effects of multiple courses of prenatal
corticosteroids on neurodevelopment and growth in humans are limited, repeated courses of
corticosteroids should be used with caution.129, level III
A systemic review by Park-Wyllie et al, found a significant association between firsttrimester corticosteroids and oral clefts in case control studies (OR=3.4, 95% CI 2.0 to
5.7).133, level II-2
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
c. Acitretin
Acitretin (X), a systemic retinoid, is contraindicated in pregnancy due to high risk
of teratogenicity129, level III, 127, level III especially in first trimester128, level III The risk of fetal
malformation in pregnancies exposed to an oral retinoid in early pregnancy is 25.6 times
higher than the general population. Acitretin characteristically caused malformation
involving craniofacial, cardiac, thymic, and central nervous system structures.129, level III
Pregnancy should be avoided in patients who are taking acitretin and for at least 2 years
after stopping treatment or longer (up to 3 years) in patients who consumed alcohol. When
alcohol is consumed, acitretin is metabolized to etretinate, which has an elimination
half-life up to 168 days. The elimination half-life of acitretin ranges from 33 to 96
hours.129, level III
Prescribing acitretin to any woman of childbearing potential warrants careful consideration.
It is prudent to document two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests before initiating
acitretin therapy. Patients should be advised to use two effective forms of contraception
simultaneously for at least 1 month before initiation of acitretin therapy, during acitretin
therapy, and for at least 2 - 3 years after discontinuing acitretin therapy. Patients should
also be advised to abstain from consuming alcohol while taking acitretin and for at least
2 months after acitretin treatment has been discontinued.129, level III
d. Methotrexate
Methotrexate (X) is contraindicated in pregnancy as it is associated with increased
risk of spontaneous miscarriage, mental retardation and aminopterin / methotrexate
syndrome.129, level III Features of this syndrome are mainly skeletal abnormalities involving
the skull and limbs, microcephaly and hydrocephalus.134, level III Data are still insufficient to
quantify exact threshold doses. However, based on pregnancy data from women exposed
to methotrexate in early pregnancy, it appears that doses greater than 10mg/week are
necessary to produce aminopterin/methotrexate syndrome and that the critical exposure
period is between 6 and 8 weeks post-conception. The effect of exposure to methotrexate
and aminopterin on foetus during the second and third trimesters is not known.129, level III
The potential foetal risk when the father is exposed to methotrexate at the time of
conception (paternal conception) remains unclear. No congenital malformation was
observed in small case series and case reports of pregnancies after paternal exposure
to low-dose methotrexate.134, level III Nevertheless, because of the mutagenic potential of
methotrexate, both men and women are to avoid conception for at least three months
after taking methotrexate.128-129,level III
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
5.1.4 Biologics
Tumour necrosis factors (TNF) inhibitors (B) such as adalimumab, etanercept and
infliximab should be used cautiously in pregnancy.128, level III Animal studies did not report
any toxicity or teratogenicity but there is limited human data.135, level III
Registry data from 142 pregnancies exposed to infliximab in Crohn’s patients did not
show any increased adverse outcome compared to the general population. Congenital
abnormalities such as Fallot’s tetralogy and intestinal malrotation, lower birthweights and
prematurity has been occasionally reported in live birth infants from mothers exposed
to infliximab.135, level III A Dermatology Expert Group reached the consensus that patients
who become pregnant while being treated with infliximab should suspend therapy
temporarily.136, level III Some expert recommend limiting the use of infliximab to the first
30 weeks of pregnancy and resumed treatment 3 - 14 days after delivery since the
transplacental transport of immunoglobulin G (Ig G) is poor until late second or early
third trimester.133, level III The teratogenic risk of adalimumab is unknown. Healthy full-term
infants were delivered by patients with Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis treated
with adalimumab in 6 case reports.129, level III
Most information on etanercept safety comes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. No
congenital malformation was seen among 25 live-born infants exposed to etanercept
during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, one case of VATER syndrome (congenital
malformation of vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, tracheo-esophageal fistula, esophageal
atresia, renal anomalies, radial dysplasia) was seen among 33 infants of women who
were on etanercept during the first trimester of pregnancy.129, level III There is no clinical data
on the use of ustekinumab in pregnancy.131, level III
5.2 Treatment in Lactating Women
Topical agents such as emollients, low-moderate potency topical corticosteroids and dithranol
are safe and can be used a first-line in treating psoriasis in lactating women. Topical treatment
should be applied after breastfeeding, and washed off thoroughly before the next feed. It is also
safe to use ultraviolet B phototherapy but PUVA should be avoided.128, level III
Systemic therapies like acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine and biologics are to be
avoided in lactating women.127-128, level III Infliximab is probably safe in breast-feeding as it
is undetectable in both infants and breast milk. Etanercept is minimally excreted in breast
milk, but systemic absorption is highly unlikely as it is a large protein.133, level III
Treatment of a pregnant woman with psoriasis should take into consideration the benefit of the
therapy to her and her foetus, and the availability of safe and effective alternatives.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
Recommendations 19
•
First-line treatment of psoriasis in pregnant and lactating patients should be topical
emollient and low-mid potent topical corticosteroids. (Grade C)
•
Ultraviolet B phototherapy may be offered when psoriasis is extensive or not controlled by
topical treatments alone during pregnancy. (Grade C)
•
Cyclosporine may be used in pregnant women with severe psoriasis. (Grade C)
•
Cyclosporine should not be used in psoriasis patients who are breast-feeding. (Grade C)
•
Acitretin and methotrexate must not be used in pregnant and lactating women and should
be avoided in those planning pregnancy.(Grade C)
•
Acitretin should be stopped two years before conception in women. (Grade C)
•
Methotrexate should be stopped three months before conception in both women and men.
(Grade C)
6. PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis. Early
recognition and treatment of PsA are essential to prevent joint damage and physical
disability.
6.1 Screening Tools
Various screening tools such as the Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST),
Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Screen (ToPAS) and Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation
Tool (PASE) have been proposed to help in the early detection of PsA.137-139, level III None of
these have been validated and are therefore not recommended for routine use in our local
setting. However, early detection of arthritis is important.
Recommendation 20
Regular assessment for early arthritis should be performed at least annually by looking
for relevant signs and symptoms (Grade C)
•
Significant early morning joint stiffness.
•
Joint swelling or dactylitis.
•
Spinal pain with significant early morning stiffness.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
6.2 Signs and Symptoms
Inflammatory joint symptoms include pain (82 - 90%), early morning stiffness more than
30 minutes (71%), swelling (32 - 68%) and peripheral joint deformity (22%).2, level III; 140, level III
Up to 17% of patients complained of inflammatory spinal pain, whilst 30 - 40% presented
with dactylitis and peripheral enthesitis in recent onset PsA.89, level III
Clinical features in favour of PsA include:89, level III; 140-142, level III
•
Personal or family history of psoriasis (past or present)
•
Distal inter-phalangeal joint (DIPJ) arthritis and asymmetrical distribution of the involved
peripheral joints
•
Dactylitis, enthesitis or axial skeletal involvement (past or present)
•
Extra-articular manifestation (uveitis)
6.3 Investigations
There is no laboratory investigation to confirm the diagnosis of PsA. However, inflammatory
markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may be helpful.
Rheumatoid factor antibody and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide are usually absent in
patients with PsA.2, level III; 89, level III; 143-145, level III
Radiographs of the hands and wrists (anteroposterior view), feet (anteroposterior and
lateral views) and all symptomatic sites (including axial sites) may aid diagnosis. 89, level
III; 142, level III; 145, level III Radiographs in early phase of disease may be normal. Characteristic
radiographic features of PsA include joint erosions, joint space narrowing, bony
proliferation including periarticular and shaft periostitis, osteolysis including ‘pencil in
cup’ deformity and acro-osteolysis, ankylosis, spur formation and spondylitis.
New imaging modalities such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging may help
to detect early changes in the joints and periarticular tissues.89, level III
There is no single diagnostic test for PsA.
Recommendation 21
•
Diagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis should be based on both clinical and radiological findings.
(Grade C)
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
6.4 CASPAR Classification Criteria
The ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR- refer Appendix 8) for the
classification of PsA amongst psoriatic patients with inflammatory joint disease have been
validated in many centres worldwide such as Europe, United States of America, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Morocco, but not in Asia.142, level III It has 98.7%
specificity and 91.4% sensitivity for established PsA. However, it is less sensitive (77%)
in classifying patients with early (less than 12 months) PsA.146, level III
6.5 Clinical Patterns
Moll and Wright classified the patterns of PsA into the following:147, level III
•
DIPJ arthritis
•
Asymmetrical oligoarthritis (less than 5 joints involvement)
•
Symmetrical polyarthritis (similar to rheumatoid arthritis)
•
Arthritis mutilans (deforming and destructive arthritis)
•
Spondyloarthritis (including sacroiliitis and spondylitis)
Oligoarthritis or polyarthritis is the commonest pattern seen in PsA from various studies.
These patterns may overlap or change over time, as the disease progresses or with the
institution of treatment. 2, level III; 7, level III; 148, level III; 141, level III; 145, level III
7. REFERRAL
Referral criteria are based on existing referral pathway of Ministry of Health Malaysia.
7.1 Dermatology Referral
Indications for referral
•
Diagnostic uncertainty
•
Erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis should be referred urgently for specialist
assessment and treatment
•
Patients who have failed adequate trial of topical therapy for 6 - 12 weeks
•
Severe psoriasis that requires phototherapy or systemic therapy
7.2 Rheumatology Referral
Indications for referral
•
Diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected PsA.
•
Formulate management plan for PsA.
MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS
8. Implementation of Guidelines
Implementation of this CPG is the responsibility of each healthcare provider. Mechansim
should be in place to review care provided against the guidelines recommendations. The
reasons for any differences should be assessed and addressed where appropriate. Local
arrangements should then be made to implement the national guidelines in individual
hospital, units and practices.
a. Facilitating and Limiting Factors
The facilitating factors in implementing these CPG are:-
i. Wide dissemination of these CPG to healthcare providers (hard-copy & soft-copy)
ii. Annual dermatology update course for primary care doctors
iii. Tele-primary care
The limiting factors in the implementation are:-
i. Cost and availability of treatment
ii. Variation in treatment practice and preferences
iii. Lack of culture to measure severity of psoriasis
b. Potential Resource Implications
In implementing recommendations in these CPG, the possible resource implication is
additional cost and human resource involved in patient care.
To enhance the utilisation of these CPG on Management of Psoriasis, the following clinical
audit indicators for quality management are proposed:-
Percentage of patients with
psoriasis assessed annually
with BSA/PASI/PGA/DLQI
=
Number of patients with psoriasis assessed
annually with BSA/PASI/PGA/DLQI
X 100%
Total number of patients with psoriasis
Percentage of patients on
biologics based on criteria*
=
Number of patients on biologics based on criteria
X 100%
Total of patients on biologics

DERMATOLOGY LIFE QUALITY INDEX
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire is designed for use in adults, i.e.
patients over the age of 16. It is self explanatory and can be simply handed to the patient
who is asked to fill it in without the need for detailed explanation. It is usually completed
in one to two minutes.
Scoring
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much
scored 3
A lot
scored 2
A little
scored 1
Not at all
scored 0
Not relevant

Question 7: “prevented work or studying”
scored 3
The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum
of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The
DLQI can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30.

Detailed analysis of the DLQI
The DLQI can be analysed under six headings as follows:
Symptoms and feelings
Questions 1 and 2
Score maximum 6
Daily activities
Questions 3 and 4
Score maximum 6
Leisure
Questions 5 and 6
Score maximum 6
Work and School
Question 7
Score maximum 3
Personal relationships
Questions 8 and 9
Score maximum 6
Treatment
Question 10
Score maximum 3
The scores for each of these sections can also be expressed as a percentage of either
6 or 3.
Interpretation of incorrectly completed questionnaires
There is a very high success rate of accurate completion of the DLQI. However, sometimes
subjects do make mistakes.
1.
If one question is left unanswered this is scored 0 and the scores are summed and
expressed as usual out of a maximum of 30.
2.
If two or more questions are left unanswered the questionnaire is not scored.
3.
If question 7 is answered ‘yes’ this is scored 3. If question 7 is answered ‘no’ or
‘not relevant’ but then either ‘a lot’ or ‘a little’ is ticked this is then scored 2 or 1.
4.
If two or more response options are ticked, the response option with the highest
score should be recorded.
5.
If there is a response between two tick boxes, the lower of the two score options
should be recorded.
6.
If one item is missing from a two- item subscale that subscale should not be
scored.

APPENDIX 8
The CASPAR Criteria*
To meet the CASPAR criteria, a patient must have inflammatory articular disease (joint,
spine, or entheseal) with ≥3 points from the following 5 categories:
1.
Evidence of current psoriasis*, a personal history of psoriasis**, or a family history of
psoriasis***.
2.
Typical psoriatic nail dystrophy including onycholysis, pitting, and hyperkeratosis
observed on current physical examination.
3.
A negative test result for the presence of rheumatoid factor by any method except
latex but preferably by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or nephelometry,
according to the local laboratory reference range.
4.
Either current dactylitis, defined as swelling of an entire digit, or a history of dactylitis
recorded by a rheumatologist.
5.
Radiographic evidence of juxtaarticular new bone formation, appearing as ill-defined
ossification near joint margins (but excluding osteophyte formation) on plain
radiographs of the hand or foot.
*The CASPAR criteria have specificity of 98.7% and sensitivity of 91.4%.
•
Current psoriasis is assigned a score of 2
•
All other features are assigned a score of 1
*Current psoriasis is defined as psoriatic skin or scalp disease present today as judged by a rheumatologist
or dermatologist
**A personal history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis that may be obtained from a patient,
family physician, dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other qualified health care provider.
***A family history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis in a first or second-degree relative
according to patient report.
