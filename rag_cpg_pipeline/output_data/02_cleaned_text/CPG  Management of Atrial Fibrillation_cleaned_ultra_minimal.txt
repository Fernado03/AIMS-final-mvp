FOREWORD BY PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL HEART ASSOCIATION
OF MALAYSIA (NHAM)
THE PUBLICATION of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Atrial Fibrillation
marked a milestone in the evolution of clinical practice guidelines and the delivery
of care in cardiology. Specifically, these guidelines assist physicians in clinical
decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches
for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of AF. Clinical Issues eg: AF
assessment, best treatment strategy for acute AF & reduce risk of adverse
outcomes from AF, best long term treatment strategy, management of AF in
specific special groups have been addressed in the CPG.
In a broader sense, these guidelines emphasized that AF is a worldwide public
health problem with increasing incidence and prevalence, high cost, and poor
outcomes. Importantly, this AF CPG has provided the framework for a public
health approach to improve the quality of care and outcomes of all individuals with
AF. This is a major paradigm shift from the focus on AF treatment and care that
has dominated the practice to IMPORTANT STRATEGIES eg: risk stratification,
appropriate antithrombotic therapy, safety consideration of antiarrhythmic agents
emphasized in rhythm strategy.
This latest version has undergone extensive revision in response to comments
during the public review. While considerable effort has gone into their preparation
over the past 2 years, and every attention has been paid to their detail and scientific
rigor, no set of guidelines, no matter how well developed, achieves its purpose
unless it is implemented and translated into clinical practice. Implementation is an
integral component of the process and accounts for the success of the guidelines.
The Work Group is now developing implementation tools essential to the success
of this AFCPG.
In a voluntary and multidisciplinary undertaking of this magnitude, many individuals
make contributions to the final product now in your hands. It is impossible to
acknowledge them individually here, but to each and every one of them we extend
our sincerest appreciation, especially to the members of the Writing Panel, an
effort subsequently reinforced by the review of these final guidelines by the
external reviewers. Thank you one and all for Making Lives Better for patients with
AF throughout Malaysia. A special debt of gratitude is due to the members of the
Work Group, their chair, Dr Ahmad Nizar. It is their commitment and dedication
that has made it all possible.

ABOUT THE GUIDELINE
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
This is the first Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Atrial Fibrillation (AF). A
committee was appointed by the National Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM),
Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy of Medicine Malaysia (AMM) to draw up
this CPG. It comprises of sixteen members including cardiologists, a neurologist,
a haematologist, a cardiac surgeon, an obstetrician, a gynaecologist, general
physicians, an intensivist, a family medicine specialist and an emergency medicine
specialist from the government, private sector and the public universities.
Objectives
This CPG is intended to assist health care providers in clinical decision making
by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis,
management, and prevention of AF.
Rigour of Development
Evidence was obtained by systematic review of current medical literature on Atrial
Fibrillation using the usual search engines – Guidelines International Network
(G-I-N), Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR),
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Journal full text via
OVID search engine, International Health Technology Assessment websites (refer
to Appendix A for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved
articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Search was limited to literature
published in English. All searches were officially conducted between 15 January
2010 and 10 December 2011. We suggest that future CPG updates will consider
evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can
be obtained upon request from the CPG secretariat.
Reference was also made to other guidelines on Atrial Fibrillation, Guidelines
for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation published by The Task Force for the
Management of Atrial Fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
2010, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Atrial Fibrillation
Guideline 2006, Evidence-based Best Practice Guideline of New Zealand on
Atrial Fibrillation 2005 and the ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines for the Management
of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation 2006 were also studied. These CPGs were
evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE)
prior being used as references.
Forty-three clinical questions were developed and divided into eight major sections
and members of the development panel were assigned individual questions within
these subtopics (refer to Appendix B for Clinical Questions). The group members
met a total 18 times throughout the development of the guideline. All retrieved
literature were appraised by at least two members and subsequently presented
for discussion during development group meetings.
All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively by
members of the Development Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient the
recommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. These CPG are
based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical
trials, with local practices taken into consideration.
On completion, the draft guidelines was sent for review by external reviewers. It
was posted on the Ministry of Health of Malaysia official website for comment and
feedback from any interested parties. These guidelines had also been presented
to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council,
Ministry of Health of Malaysia for review and approval.
The level of recommendation and the grading of evidence used in this guideline
were adapted from the American Heart Association and the European Society of
Cardiology (AHA/ESC) and outlined on page xi. In the text, this is written in black
and boxed on the left hand margin.
Sources of Funding
Sanofi Aventis (M) Sdn. Bhd. supported the development of the CPG on
Management of Atrial Fibrillation financially. However, the views of the funding
body have not influenced the content of the guideline.
Disclosure statement
The development panel members had completed disclosure forms. None held
shares in pharmaceutical firms or acted as consultants to such firms. (Details are
available upon request from the CPG Secretariat)
Clinical Issues Addressed
1. How do you assess a patient suspected of having atrial fibrillation?
2. What is the best strategy to treat patients with atrial fibrillation in the acute
setting?
3. What is the best strategy to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes from atrial
fibrillation?
4. What is the best long-term management strategy?
5. How to manage atrial fibrillation in specific special groups?
Target Group
This CPG is directed at all healthcare providers treating patients with AF –
allied professionals, family and general physicians, medical officers, emergency
physicians, intensivists and cardiologists.
Target Population
It is developed to assist clinical decision making for all adults and pregnant
women with AF.
Period of Validity of the Guidelines
This guideline needs to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with
recent developments and knowledge.
Implementation of the Guidelines
To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:
1. Constant checks and feedback on whether the guideline is relevant.
2. Identify implementation leaders
Identification of multiple leaders to share the implementation work and ensure
seamless care. These leaders are likely to be prominent figures who will
champion the guideline and inspire others.
3. Identify an implementation group
Support from medical associations such as the Private Medical Practitioners
Society (PMPS), Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (SOPACE)
and Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) will help dissemination of the
guidelines.
4. Carrying out a baseline assessment
This involves comparing current practice with the recommendations. The audit
criteria will help this baseline assessment.
5. Developing an action plan
The baseline assessment will have identified which recommendations are
not currently being carried out. These recommendations could be put into an
action plan.
6. Key areas for implementation
We have identified several goals for implementation based on the key priorities
for implementation identified in the guideline

SUMMARY
KEY MESSAGES
1
An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed in all patients, whether
symptomatic or not, in whom AF is suspected because an irregular pulse
has been detected.
2
The stroke risk stratification algorithms, CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc,
should be used in patients with AF to assess their risk of stroke and
thrombo-embolism, while the HAS-BLED score should be used to assess
their risk of bleeding.
3
Antithrombotic therapy should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke/
thrombo-embolism and bleeding, and the relative risk and benet for a
given patient.
4
When choosing either an initial rate-control or rhythm-control strategy, the
indications for each option should not be regarded as mutually exclusive
and the potential advantages and disadvantages of each strategy should be
explained to patients before agreeing which to adopt. Any comorbidities that
might indicate one approach rather than the other should be taken into
account . Irrespective of whether a rate-control or a rhythm-control strategy
is adopted in patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF, appropriate
antithrombotic therapy should be used.
5
When choosing an antiarrhythmic agent for rhythm control strategy, safety
rather than efficacy considerations should primarily guide the choice of
antiarrhythmic agent.
6
In patients with permanent AF, who need treatment for rate control, betablockers or rate-limiting calcium antagonists should be the preferred initial
monotherapy in all patients while digoxin should only be considered as
monotherapy in predominantly sedentary patients.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 DEFINITION
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an atrial tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated
atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. The
surface ECG is characterized by ‘absolutely’ irregular RR intervals and the
absence of any distinct P waves. The P waves are replaced by fibrillary (F)
waves.
Atrial Flutter (AFl) in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of
regular atrial activation called flutter (F) waves on the ECG. AFl commonly
occurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a regular or irregular ventricular rate of 120
to 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute).
1.2 TYPES OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
Clinically, five types of AF are recognized based on the presentation and the
duration of the episode. These categories are set out below. (See Table 1 and
Figure 2)

Version) (European heart Journal 2010; doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehq278)
The term ‘lone AF’ applies to young individuals (under 60 years of age) without
clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease, including
hypertension. These patients have a favourable prognosis with respect to
thromboembolism and mortality.
‘Silent AF’ being asymptomatic is detected by an opportunistic ECG or may
present as an AF-related complication such as ischemic stroke.
This classication is useful for clinical management of AF patients (Figure 1),
especially when AF-related symptoms are also considered.
AF is a naturally progressive disease except for a small proportion of patients (23%), who are free of AF-promoting conditions (see section 2.1.1, page 5), may
remain in paroxysmal AF over several decades.1 AF progresses from short rare
episodes, to longer and more frequent attacks (See Figure 2). With time, often
years, many patients will develop sustained forms of AF. Paroxysm of AF
episodes also occurs in cluster and ”AF burden” can vary markedly over months
or years.2
Figure 1: Different types of AF. AF = atrial fibrillation; CV = cardioversion. The arrhythmia tends to progress
from paroxysmal (self-terminating, usually ,48 h) to persistent [non-self-terminating or requiring
cardioversion (CV)], long-standing persistent (lasting longer than 1 year) and eventually to permanent
(accepted) AF. First-onset AF may be the first of recurrent attacks or already be deemed permanent.
Asymptomatic AF is common even in symptomatic patients, irrespective of
whether the initial presentation was persistent or paroxysmal. This has important
implications for strategies aimed at preventing AF-related complications.

1.3 AF NATURAL TIME COURSE
1.4 EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PROGNOSIS
AF is the commonest sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Information on AF in
Malaysia is scarce. Hospital practice data may give a biased view of the clinical
epidemiology of AF, since only one-third of patients with AF may actually have
been admitted to hospital.
Data from predominantly western populations suggest the estimated prevalence
of AF is 0.4% to 1% in the general population. The prevalence of AF doubles with
each decade of age, from 0.5% at age 50-59 years to almost 9% at age 80-89
years.3-4
The mortality rate of patients with AF is about double that of patients in sinus
rhythm.2,5
AF is associated with a prothrombotic state, intra-atrial stasis, structural heart
disease or blood vessel abnormalities and abnormal platelets haemostasis,
leading to a predisposition to thrombus formation. This prothrombotic state leads
to stroke and thromboembolism in AF (See Table 1, Page 1). Only antithrombotic
therapy has been shown to reduce AF-related deaths.6
3
Figure 2 : ‘Natural’ time course of AF. AF = atrial fibrillation. The dark blue boxes show a typical sequence of
periods in AF against a background of sinus rhythm, and illustrate the progression of AF from silent and
undiagnosed to paroxysmal and chronic forms, at times symptomatic. The upper bars indicate therapeutic
measures that could be pursued. Light blue boxes indicate therapies that have proven effects on ‘hard
outcomes’ in AF, such as stroke or acute heart failure. Red boxes indicate therapies that are currently used
for symptom relief, but may in the future contribute to reduction of AF-related complications. Rate control
(grey box) is valuable for symptom relief and may improve cardiovascular outcomes.
Adapted from the ESC Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation (2010 Version) (European heart
Journal 2010; doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehq278)
Stroke in AF is often severe and results in long-term disability or death.
Approximately 20% of stroke is due to AF and undiagnosed ‘silent AF’ is a likely
cause of some ‘cryptogenic’ strokes.2,7 Paroxysmal AF carries the same stroke
risk as permanent or persistent AF.8
AF also account for one-third of all admissions for cardiac arrhythmias. Acute
Coronary Syndrome (ACS), aggravation of heart failure, thrombo-embolic
complications, and acute arrhythmia management are the main causes.
Quality of life and exercise capacity are degraded in patients with AF.9 This may
be related to impaired left ventricular (LV) function that accompanies the
irregular, fast ventricular rate, loss of atrial contractile function and increased
end-diastolic LV lling pressure.

Outcomes are listed in hierarchical order modified from a suggestion put
forward in a recent consensus document.2 The prevention of these outcomes
is the main therapeutic goal in AF patients.
Death rate doubled.
2. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Understanding the pathophysiology of atrial brillation (AF) requires integration
of
information
from
clinical,
histological,
electrophysiological
and
echocardiographic sources. There is no single cause or mechanism that results
in AF, and it may present in a multitude of ways.
2.1 CLINICAL ASPECTS
There are many risk factors for developing AF. In the Framingham study the
development of AF was associated with increasing age, diabetes, hypertension
and valve disease. It is also commonly associated with, and complicated by HF
and strokes.
2.1.1 CAUSES AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS
AF is often associated with co-existing medical conditions. The underlying
conditions and factors predisposing patients to AF are listed in Table 3.
Table 3: Common cardiac and non-cardiac risk factors of AF.
Elevated Atrial Pressure
Systemic Hypertension
Pulmonary Hypertension
Myocardial disease (cardiomyopathy with systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction)
Mitral or tricuspid valve disease
Aortic or pulmonary valve disease
Intracardiac tumours
Sleep apnoea
Atrial ischemia
Coronary artery disease
Inflammatory or infiltrative atrial disease
Myocarditis or pericarditis
Amyloidosis
Age-induced atrial fibrosis
Primary or metastatic cancer in/or adjacent to the atrial wall
Drugs
Alcohol
Caffeine
Endocrine disorders
Hyperthyroidism
Phaeochromocytoma
Changes in autonomic tone
Increased sympathetic tone
Increased parasympathetic tone

Cardiothoracic surgery
Oesophageal surgery
Neurogenic
Subarchnoid haemorrhage
Haemorrhagic stroke
Ischemic stroke
Idiopathic
Lone AF
Familial AF
Other
Congenital heart disease
Chronic renal disease
Obesity
Some of the conditions predisposing to AF may be reversible such as acute
infections, alcohol excess, surgery, pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary
pathology and thyrotoxicosis. Therefore, long-term therapy of AF may not be
indicated once the reversible causes have been addressed. When AF is
associated with other supraventricular arrhythmias, treatment of the primary
arrhythmia reduces or eliminates the recurrence of AF.
Approximately 30 – 40% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20 – 25% of persistent
AF occur in young patients without demonstrable underlying disease. These
cases are often referred to as ‘lone AF’.
3 INITIAL MANAGEMENT
3.1 CLINICAL HISTORY, PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATIONS
The acute management of AF patients should concentrate on
Relief of symptoms
Assessment of AF-associated risk
Determination of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) score
(Table 5, page 7)
Estimation of stroke risk (see Section 6.1, page 26)
Search for conditions that predispose to AF (see Section 2.1.1, page 5) and
Search for complications of the arrhythmia (see Section 1.4, page 3)
With the above in mind, a thorough medical history should be obtained from the
patient with suspected or known AF (see Table 4).
AF = atrial fibrillation; CCS-SAF = Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation; EHRA =
European Heart Rhythm Association.
6
Table 4: Relevant questions to be put to a patient with suspected or known AF
Does the heart rhythm during the episode feel regular or irregular?
Is there any precipitating factor such as exercise, emotion, or
alcohol intake?
Are symptoms during the episodes moderate or severe—the severity
may be expressed using the EHRA score,3 which is similar to the
CCS-SAF score.41
Are the episodes frequent or infrequent, and are they long or short
lasting?
Is there a history of concomitant disease such as hypertension,
coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, or chronic pulmonary
disease?
Is there an alcohol abuse habit?
Is there a family history of AF?
The EHRA symptom score (see Table 5) provides a simple clinical tool for
assessing symptoms during AF. The score only considers symptoms that are
attributable to AF and reverse or reduce upon restoration of sinus rhythm or with
effective rate control.
3.1.1 DETECTION
Those with undiagnosed AF can receive treatment sooner if an opportunistic
case finding is undertaken. Routine palpation of the radial pulse (not less than 20
seconds) during screening of blood pressure will be a good opportunity to pick up
undiagnosed atrial fibrillation.
In patients presenting with any of the following:
x breathlessness/dyspnoea,
x palpitations,
x syncope/dizziness,
x chest discomfort or stroke/TIA,
manual pulse palpation should be performed to assess for the presence of an
irregular pulse that may indicate AF.
3.1.1.1 ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
The diagnosis of AF requires confirmation by ECG, sometimes in the form
of bedside telemetry, ambulatory Holter recordings and event loop
recordings.2, 10
If AF is present at the time of recording, a standard 12-lead ECG is sufficient to
confirm the diagnosis. In paroxysmal AF, 7-days Holter ECG recording or daily
and symptom-activated event recordings may document the arrhythmia in 70% of
AF patients.2

Explanation
‘No symptoms’
‘Mild symptoms’; normal daily activity not affected
‘Severe symptoms’; normal daily activity affected
‘Disabling symptoms’; normal daily activity

The search for AF should be intensified; including prolonged monitoring, when
patients
Are highly symptomatic (EHRA III & IV)
Present with recurrent syncope and
After a cryptogenic stroke.11, 12
In stroke survivors, a step-wise addition of ve daily short-term ECGs, one 24 h
Holter ECG, and another 7-day Holter ECG will each increase the detection rate
of AF by a similar extent.11
3.2 DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
The initial diagnostic work-up is driven by the initial presentation.
The time of onset of AF should be established to dene the type of AF (Figure 2).
Patients with AF and signs of acute heart failure require urgent rate control and
often cardioversion. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be
performed in haemodynamically-compromised patients to assess LV and valvular
function and right ventricular pressure. If AF duration is >48 h or there is doubt
about its duration, transesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) should be used to
rule out intracardiac thrombus prior to cardioversion.13
Patients with stroke or TIA require immediate stroke diagnosis, usually via
emergency computed tomography (CT).
Patients should be assessed for risk of stroke. Most patients with acute AF will
require anticoagulation unless they are at low risk of thromboembolic
complications (no stroke risk factors) and no cardioversion is necessary (e.g. AF
terminates within 24 – 48 h).
After the initial management of symptoms and complications, underlying causes
of AF should be sought. A TTE is useful to detect ventricular, valvular, and atrial
disease as well as rare congenital heart disease. Thyroid function tests, a full
blood count, a serum creatinine measurement and analysis for proteinuria,
measurement of blood pressure, and a test for diabetes mellitus are useful. A
serum test for hepatic function may be considered in selected patients. A stress
test is reasonable in patients with signs or risk factors for coronary artery
disease. Patients with persistent signs of LV dysfunction and/or signs of
myocardial ischemia are candidates for coronary angiography
Table 6 lists the clinical evaluation that may be necessary in patients with AF.

Type IC refers to the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmic drugs (see Appendix D). AF = atrial
fibrillation; AV = atrioventricular; LA = left atrial; LV = left ventricular; MI = myocardial infarction; RA = right
atrial; RV = right ventricular.
3.3 ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
TTE should be performed in patients with AF:
o For whom a baseline echocardiogram is important for long-term
management.
o For whom a rhythm-control strategy that includes cardioversion
(electrical or pharmacological) is being considered.
o In whom there is a high risk or a suspicion of underlying
structural/functional heart disease (such as heart failure or heart
murmur) that influences their subsequent management (for
example, choice of antiarrhythmic drug)
o In whom refinement of clinical risk stratification for antithrombotic
therapy is needed.
In patients with AF who require anticoagulation therapy based on relevant clinical
criteria, TTE need not be routinely performed.
TOE should be performed in patients with AF:
o Where TTE is technically difficult and/or of questionable quality and
where there is a need to exclude cardiac abnormalities
o For whom TOE-guided cardioversion is being considered. (See
section 6.4.5, page 38)
3.4 CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP
The specialist caring for the AF patient should not only perform the baseline
assessment and institute the appropriate treatment, but also suggest a structured
plan for follow-up.
Important considerations during follow-up of the AF patient are listed below:
x Has the risk prole changed (e.g. new diabetes or hypertension), especially
with regard to the indication for anticoagulation?
x Is anticoagulation now necessary—have new risk factors developed, or
has the need for anticoagulation passed, e.g. postcardioversion in a
patient with low thrombo-embolic risk?
x Have the patient’s symptoms improved on therapy; if not, should other
therapy be considered?
x Are there signs of proarrhythmia or risk of proarrhythmia; if so, should the
dose of an antiarrhythmic drug be reduced or a change made to another
therapy?
x Has paroxysmal AF progressed to a persistent/permanent form, in spite of
antiarrhythmic drugs; in such a case, should another therapy be
considered?
x Is the rate control approach working properly; has the target for heart rate
at rest and during exercise been reached?
The diagnosis of AF requires documentation by ECG.2,10
In patients with suspected AF, an attempt to record an ECG should be made
when symptoms suggestive of AF occur.2,14
A simple symptom score (EHRA class) is recommended to quantify AF-related
symptoms.2,15
All patients with AF should undergo a thorough physical examination, and a
cardiac- and arrhythmia-related history should be taken.
In patients with severe symptoms, documented or suspected heart disease, or
risk factors, an echocardiogram is recommended.2,16,17
In patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, a 12-lead ECG should be recorded
at regular intervals during follow-up.
In patients with suspected symptomatic AF, additional ECG monitoring should be
considered in order to document the arrhythmia.2,18
Additional ECG monitoring should be considered for detection of ‘silent’ AF in
patients who may have sustained an AF-related complication.2,19
In patients with AF treated with rate control, Holter ECG monitoring should be
considered for assessment of rate control or bradycardia.
In young active patients with AF treated with rate control, exercise testing should
be considered in order to assess ventricular rate control.
In patients with documented or suspected AF, an echocardiogram should be
considered.
Patients with symptomatic AF or AF-related complications should be considered
for referral to a cardiologist.
A structured follow-up plan prepared by a specialist is useful for follow-up by a
general or primary care physician.
In patients treated with rhythm control, repeated ECG monitoring may be
considered to assess the efficacy of treatment.2,20,21
Most patients with AF may benet from specialist follow-up at regular intervals.

Figure 3: Choice of rate and rhythm control strategies. Rate control is needed for most patients with AF unless the heart rate during AF is naturally slow. Rhythm
control may be added to rate control if the patient is symptomatic despite adequate rate control, or if a rhythm control strategy is selected because of factors such
as the degree of symptoms, younger age, or higher activity levels. Permanent AF is managed by rate control unless it is deemed possible to restore sinus rhythm
when the AF category is re-designated as ‘long-standing persistent’. Paroxysmal AF is more often managed with a rhythm control strategy, especially if it is
symptomatic and there is little or no associated underlying heart disease. Solid lines indicate the first-line management strategy. Dashed lines represent fall-back
objectives and dotted lines indicate alternative approaches which may be used in selected patients.

4. MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES
4.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES
In patients with AF or AFI, the aims of treatment involve the following five
objectives.
I Relief of symptoms, such as palpitations, dizziness, fatigue and dyspnoea,
is paramount to the patient.
II. The prevention of serious complications, such as thromboembolism
(particularly ischaemic stroke) and heart failure, is equally important.
III. Optimal management of concomitant cardiovascular disease.
IV. Rate control.
V. Correction of rhythm disturbance.
These goals are not mutually exclusive and may be pursued simultaneously. The
initial strategy may differ from the long-term therapeutic goal.
A fundamental question to be answered for every patient with AF or AFI is
whether to obtain and maintain sinus rhythm by pharmacological or
nonpharmacological means (a rhythm-control strategy), or whether to aim
primarily to control heart rate rather than the rhythm (a rate-control strategy).
For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be
anticoagulation and rate control while the long-term goal is to restore sinus
rhythm.
If rate control offers inadequate symptomatic relief, restoration of sinus rhythm
becomes a clear long-term goal. When cardioversion is contemplated and the
duration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48 h, anticoagulation will be necessary.
Early cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening
heart failure. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older
patients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In
some circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as
for instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term
therapy may be necessary.
Regardless of the approach, the need for anticoagulation is based on stroke risk
and not on whether sinus rhythm is maintained.
For rate and rhythm control, drugs remain the first choice. Radiofrequency
ablation may be considered in symptomatic AF and in lone AF to avoid long-term
drug therapy. In selected individuals undergoing cardiac surgery, surgical maze
procedure may be a therapeutic option.
4.2 THROMBOEMBOLIC PROPHYLAXIS
Antithrombotic therapy must be considered in all patients with AF. Strategies that
may reduce thromboembolic risk include the following treatments:
• Anticoagulants such as Vitamin K Antagonist,
• Antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel
• Intravenous (IV) heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
• Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion, either surgically or percutaneously.
The decision regarding the method of reduction in the risk of stroke, should take
into account both the person’s risk of thromboembolism and their risk of bleeding.
It is important to remember that vitamin K antagonist such as Warfarin is very
effective and reduces the risk of stroke overall by two thirds. (For details see
Section 6, page 26)
4.3. HEART RATE CONTROL VERSUS RHYTHM CONTROL
Rate control involves the use of chronotropic drugs or electrophysiological or
surgical interventions to reduce the rapid heart rate (ventricular rate) often found
in patients with AF. Although the atria continue to fibrillate with this strategy, it is
nonetheless thought to be an effective treatment as it improves symptoms and
reduces the risk of associated morbidity. However, the persistence of the
arrhythmia continues the risk of stroke and thromboembolic events occurring.
Administering antithrombotic drugs reduces this risk. (See Figure 3, page 12)
Rhythm control involves the use of electrical or pharmacological cardioversion or
electrophysiological or surgical interventions to convert the arrhythmia associated
with AF to normal sinus rhythm. Patients who have been successfully
cardioverted are generally administered antiarrhythmic drugs for the long term to
help prevent the recurrence of AF. The rhythm control strategies also require the
appropriate administration of antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke
and thromboembolic events occurring.
Randomized trials comparing outcomes of rhythm versus rate control strategies
in patients with AF are summarized in Table 7 and 8.22-28

Strategies of Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.
The consistent nding in all ve studies was that rhythm control offered no
survival advantage and, in most cases, had little effect on morbidity and quality of
life. However, it should be emphasised that these conclusions are not necessarily
applicable to all groups of patients. The ve recent studies enrolled mostly older
patients with additional risk factors for stroke, many of whom also had heart
failure. Younger patients with normal hearts and primarily paroxysmal atrial
brillation (PAF) were not well represented. Importantly, in a predened subgroup
of AFFIRM participants aged less than 65 years, hazard ratios for death showed
a paradoxical trend towards superiority of the rhythm-control strategy.
The initial therapy after onset of AF should always include adequate
antithrombotic treatment and control of the ventricular rate. If the ultimate goal is
restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, rate control medication should be
continued throughout follow-up, unless continuous sinus rhythm is present. The
goal is to control the ventricular rate adequately whenever recurrent AF occurs.
The decision to add rhythm control therapy to the management of AF requires an
individual decision and should therefore be discussed at the beginning of AF
management. Before choosing rate control alone as a long-term strategy, the
clinician should consider how permanent AF is likely to affect the individual
patient in the future and how successful rhythm control is expected to be (Figure
3, page 12). Symptoms related to AF are an important determinant in making the
decision to opt for rate or rhythm control (e.g. globally assessed by the EHRA
score, Table 5, page 7), in addition to factors that may inuence the success of
rhythm control. The latter include a long history of AF, older age, more severe
associated cardiovascular diseases, other associated medical conditions, and
enlarged LA size.
A rate-control strategy should be the preferred initial option in the following
patients with persistent AF:
x Over 65 years old
x With coronary artery disease and/or left ventricular dysfunction
x With contraindications to antiarrhythmic drugs
x Unsuitable for cardioversion*
A rhythm-control strategy should be the preferred initial option in the following
patients with persistent AF:
x Those who are symptomatic
x Younger patients
x Those presenting for the first time with lone AF
x Those with AF secondary to a treated/corrected precipitant
Rate control should be the initial approach in elderly patients with AF and minor
symptoms (EHRA class 1).23,24,27

5. MANAGEMENT – ACUTE-ONSET AF
5.1 ACUTE AF IN HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE PATIENTS
The majority of patients who present with AF are hemodynamically stable but
there is a small group of patients who are significantly compromised by the onset
of AF. These patients require immediate hospitalization and urgent intervention
to prevent further deterioration.
Those considered in this group are; 33
x Those with a ventricular rate greater than 150 bpm
x With ongoing chest pains, or
x Critical perfusion.
In these circumstances, the concerns regarding intervention in the absence of
anticoagulation and echocardiography are counterbalanced by the need for
urgent treatment.
5.1.1 ACUTE RATE CONTROL
It is important to understand that in these circumstances the slow onset of
digoxin makes it inappropriate for use in this situation. Patients whose AF is
associated with thyrotoxicosis will not respond to any measures until the
underlying thyroid disease is first treated. Patients with accessory pathway such
as the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome are particularly at risk following
the onset of AF because they can present with very rapid ventricular rates
(greater than 200 bpm) and may need specific management.
When patients present with unacceptably high ventricular rate the primary aim is
one of rate control.
AF with slow ventricular rates may respond to atropine (0.5 – 2 mg i.v.), but many
patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmia may require either urgent placement
of a temporary pacemaker lead in the right ventricle and/or cardioversion.
Acute initiation of rate control therapy should usually be followed by a long-term
rate control strategy; details of drugs and doses are given in Section 7 on page 66.
Rhythm control should be considered in patients with AF secondary to a trigger
or substrate that has been corrected (e.g. ischaemia, hyperthyroidism).

5.1.2 PHARMACOLOGICAL CARDIOVERSION
In the presence of other cardiac abnormalities (e.g. hypertensive heart disease,
valvular heart disease), onset of AF with acceptable ventricular rates may still
compromised cardiac function. While rate control is unlikely to bring about clinical
improvement in these circumstances, there is a need for the restoration of sinus
rhythm.
19
IC
Pharmacological cardioversion of AF may be initiated by a bolus administration
of an antiarrhythmic drug. Although the conversion rate with antiarrhythmic drugs
is lower than with direct current cardioversion (DCCV), it does not require
conscious sedation or anesthesia, and may facilitate the choice of antiarrhythmic
drug therapy to prevent recurrent AF.
Most patients who undergo pharmacological cardioversion require continuous
medical supervision and ECG monitoring during the drug infusion and for a
period afterwards (usually about half the drug elimination half-life) to detect
proarrhythmic events such as ventricular proarrhythmia, sinus node arrest, or
atrioventricular block.
Several agents are available for pharmacological cardioversion (see Table 10 on
page 20).

patients with a proportion of these reverting to sinus rhythm over a longer period.

In suitable patients with recent-onset AF (generally <48 hours duration), a trial of
pharmacological cardioversion to sinus rhythm can be offered with ecainide or
propafenone (when there is little or no underlying structural heart disease) or i.v
amiodarone (when there is structural disease) (Figure 4, page 21). The
anticipated conversion rate is 50% within ~15 – 120 min.
x Low serum potassium,
x Or renal or hepatic insufficiency.
With such an approach emergency room visits and hospitalization could
markedly be reduced.
In selected patients with recent-onset AF and no signicant structural heart
disease, a single high oral dose of ecainide or propafenone (the ‘pill-in-thepocket’ approach) should be considered, provided this treatment has proven safe
during previous testing in a medically secure environment.42
IIaB
When pharmacological cardioversion is preferred and there is no structural heart
disease, oral ecainide or propafenone is recommended for cardioversion of
recent-onset AF.36-38

In patients with recent-onset AF and structural heart disease, i.v. amiodarone is
recommended.39-41

recent- onset AF to sinus rhythm and are not recommended.
IIIABC
In patients with a life-threatening deterioration in haemodynamic stability
following the onset of AF, emergency electrical cardioversion should be
performed, irrespective of the duration of the AF.
IC
5.1.2.1 Pill-in-the-pocket approach
The pill-in-the-pocket approach42 refers to outpatient administration of oral
ecainide (200 to 300 mg) or propafenone (450 to 600 mg) to carefully selected
patients whose initial therapy in hospital was effective and well tolerated.
IIaB
This approach could be considered in appropriately selected patients who have
infrequent but prolonged symptoms of paroxysmal AF (PAF).
There is an uncommon probability of AF reverting to AFL with this approach and
before antiarrhythmic medication is initiated, a beta-blocker, diltiazem or
verapamil should be given to prevent rapid AV conduction.
Patients with the conditions below are contraindicated for such an approach:
x Those aged more than 75 years,
x Those with AF duration greater than 7 days,
x NYHA Class III to IV or signs of heart failure on examination,
x AF with a mean ventricular rate less than 70 bpm,
x Previous myocardial infarction or angina,
x Valvular heart disease,
x Cardiomyopathy,
x Bundle branch block,
x Known sick sinus syndrome,

5.1.3 DIRECT CURRENT CARDIOVERSION
DCCV is an effective method of converting AF to sinus rhythm. Successful DCCV
is usually dened as termination of AF, documented as the presence of two or
more consecutive P waves after shock delivery.
5.1.3.1 Procedure
Unless adequate anticoagulation has been documented for 4 weeks or AF is 48
h from a denite onset, a TOE should be performed to rule out atrial thrombi (see
Figure 9, page 39).
A pacing catheter or external pacing pads may be needed if asystole or
bradycardia occurs.
Evidence favours the use of biphasic external debrillators because of their lower
energy requirements and greater efficacy compared with monophasic
debrillators. Trials have demonstrated a signicant increase in the rst shock
success rate of DCCV for AF when biphasic waveforms were used.
Currently, two conventional positions are commonly used for electrode
placement (see Figure 5). Several studies have shown that anteroposterior
electrode placement is more effective than anterolateral placement.43 If initial
shocks are unsuccessful for terminating the arrhythmia, the electrodes should be
repositioned and cardioversion repeated.
The recommended initial energy for synchronised cardioversion (see figure 6) is:
x 200J or greater with monophasic waveform
x 100J or greater with biphasic waveform
x 10-50J biphasic waveform for AFL
Outpatient/day care DCCV can be undertaken in patients who are
haemodynamically stable and do not have severe underlying heart disease. At
least 3 h of ECG and haemodynamic monitoring are needed after the procedure,
before the patient is allowed to leave the hospital.
Internal cardioversion may be helpful in special situations, e.g. when a patient
undergoes invasive procedures and cardioversion catheters can be placed
without further vascular access and when implanted debrillation devices are
present.
5.1.3.2 Complications
The risks and complications of cardioversion are associated primarily with
x Thrombo-embolic events,
x Post-cardioversion arrhythmias, and
x The risks of general anesthesia.
The procedure is associated with 1 – 2% risk of thromboembolism, which can be
reduced by adequate anticoagulation in the weeks prior to cardioversion or by
exclusion of left atrium thrombi before the procedure. Skin burns are a common
complication. In patients with sinus node dysfunction, especially in elderly
patients with structural heart disease, prolonged sinus arrest without an adequate
escape rhythm may occur. Dangerous arrhythmias, such as ventricular
tachycardia and brillation, may arise in the presence of hypokalaemia, digitalis
intoxication, or improper synchronization. The patient may become hypoxic or
hypoventilate from sedation, but hypotension and pulmonary oedema are rare.
5.1.3.3 Cardioversion in patients with implanted pacemakers and
debrillators
The electrode paddle should be at least 8 cm from the pacemaker battery, and
the antero-posterior paddle positioning is recommended. Biphasic shocks are
preferred because they require less energy for AF termination. In pacemakerdependent patients, an increase in pacing threshold should be anticipated. In the
absence of a pacemaker programmer, a pacing magnet may be placed over the
pacemaker generator pocket to provide temporary pacing support. These
patients should be monitored carefully. After cardioversion, the device should be
interrogated and evaluated to ensure normal function.
5.1.3.4 Recurrence after cardioversion
Recurrences after DCCV can be divided into three phases:
(1) Immediate recurrences, which occur within the rst few minutes after DCCV.
(2) Early recurrences, which occur during the rst 5 days after DCCV.
Figure 6 : ECG strip showing synchronized cardioversion
(3) Late recurrence, which occur thereafter.
Factors that predispose to AF recurrence are age, AF duration before
cardioversion, number of previous recurrences, an increased LA size or reduced
LA function, and the presence of coronary heart disease or pulmonary or mitral
valve disease. Atrial ectopic beats with a long – short sequence, faster heart
rates, and variations in atrial conduction increase the risk of AF recurrence.
Pre-treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, sotalol, ecainide,
and propafenone increases the likelihood of restoration of sinus rhythm.44-46
Some highly symptomatic patients in whom AF occurs infrequently (e.g. once or
twice a year) strongly prefer to undergo repeated cardioversions as a long-term
rhythm control strategy, rather than opting for rate control or other rhythm control
modalities which they may nd uncomfortable.
Immediate DCCV is recommended when a rapid ventricular rate does not
respond promptly to pharmacological measures in patients with AF and ongoing
myocardial ischaemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or heart failure.
IC
Immediate DCCV is recommended for patients with AF involving pre-excitation
when rapid tachycardia or haemodynamic instability is present.47
IB
Elective DCCV should be considered in order to initiate a long-term rhythm
control management strategy for patients with AF. 41,43,48
IIaB
Pre-treatment with amiodarone, ecainide, propafenone or sotalol should be
considered to enhance success of DCCV and prevent recurrent AF.44-46
IIaB
Repeated DCCV may be considered in highly symptomatic patients refractory to
other therapy.
IIbC
Pre-treatment with ȕ-blockers, diltiazem or verapamil may be considered for rate
control, although the efficacy of these agents in enhancing success of DCCV or
IIbC
preventing early recurrence of AF is uncertain.

6. MANAGEMENT - PREVENTION OF THROMBOEMBOLISM
6.1 RISK STRATIFICATION FOR STROKE
Assessment of thromboembolic risk or risk stratification allows the clinician to
consider anticoagulant treatment for those people who are at an increased risk of
stroke.
Two recent systematic reviews have addressed the evidence base for stroke risk
factors in AF,49,50 and concluded that prior stroke/TIA/thrombo-embolism, age,
hypertension, diabetes, and structural heart disease are important risk factors.
The presence of moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction TTE is the only
independent echocardiographic risk factor for stroke on multivariable analysis.
On TOE, the presence of LA thrombus, complex aortic plaques, spontaneous
echo-contrast and low LAA velocities are independent predictors of stroke and
thrombo-embolism.
Patients with paroxysmal AF should be regarded as having a stroke risk similar
to those with persistent or permanent AF, in the presence of risk factors.
Patients aged less than 60 years, with ‘lone AF’, i.e. no clinical history or physical
evidence of cardiovascular disease, carry a very low cumulative stroke risk,
estimated to be 1.3% over 15 years.
The various stroke clinical risk factors has led to publication of various stroke
schemes.51,52 The simplest risk assessment scheme is the CHADS2 score and as
shown in Table 11, has good stroke correlation. The CHADS2 [cardiac failure,
hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke (doubled)] risk index evolved from the AF
Investigators and Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) Investigators
criteria, and is based on a point system in which 2 points are assigned for a
history of stroke or TIA and 1 point each is assigned for age >75 years, a history
of hypertension, diabetes, or recent cardiac failure.51
The CHADS2 stroke risk stratication scheme should be used as an initial, rapid,
and easy-to-remember means of assessing stroke risk. In patients with a
CHADS2 score 2, chronic OAC therapy with a VKA is recommended in a doseadjusted approach to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) target of 2.5
(range, 2.0 – 3.0), unless contraindicated.6,52
Table 11: CHADS2 score and stroke rate
A comparison of the 12 published risk-stratication49 schemes to predict stroke in
patients with non-valvular AF found that most had very modest predictive value
for stroke and the proportion of patients assigned to individual risk categories
varied widely across the schemes. The CHADS2 score categorized most subjects
as ‘moderate risk’. The choice of antithrombotic (anticoagulants or antiplatelets)
for the ‘moderate risk’ group was at best uncertain.
Several published analyses 49,50,53-55 have found even patients at ‘moderate risk’
(currently dened as CHADS2 score =1, i.e. one risk factor) still derive signicant
benet from OAC over aspirin use, often with low rates of major haemorrhage.
Importantly, prescription of an antiplatelet agent was not associated with a lower
risk of adverse events.
Also, the CHADS2 score does not include many stroke risk factors, and other
‘stroke risk modiers’ need to be considered in a comprehensive stroke risk
assessment (see Table 11, page 27).
Rather than the use of the ‘low’, ‘moderate’, and ‘high’ risk characterization that
only showed a modest predictive value, this guideline has adopted and recognize
that risk is a continuum. A risk factor-based approach for a more detailed stroke
risk assessment is encouraged for recommending the use of antithrombotic
therapy.
aThe adjusted stroke rate was derived from the multivariable analysis assuming no aspirin usage; these
stroke rates are based on data from a cohort of hospitalized AF patients, published in 2001, with low
numbers in those with a CHADS2 score of 5 and 6 to allow an accurate judgement of the risk in these
patients. Given that stroke rates are declining overall, actual stroke rates in contemporary nonhospitalized cohorts may also vary from these estimates. Adapted from Gage F et al.51 AF = atrial
fibrillation; CHADS2 = cardiac failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke (doubled).

The risk factor-based approached for patients with non-valvular AF have been
given an acronym, CHA2DS2VASc and the schema is based on two groups of
risk factors:
x
Major risk factors - prior history of stroke, TIA or thromboembolism
and/or age 75 or older
x
Clinically relevant ‘non-major’ risk factors - hypertension, heart failure
(EF  40%), diabetes, age 65–74 years, female gender, and vascular
disease (myocardial infarction, complex aortic plaques and PAD).
The risk may be calculated based on a point system in which 2 points are
allocated for each ‘Major risk factors’; and 1 point each is assigned for
‘Clinically relevant ‘non major’ risk factors’ (see Table 11 on page 27).
6.2 STRATEGIES FOR THROMBOEMBOLIC PROPHYLAXIS
The CHADS2 stroke risk stratication scheme should be used as a simple initial
(and easily remembered) means of assessing stroke risk, particularly suited to
primary care doctors and non-specialists.
In patients with a CHADS2 score of 2, chronic OAC therapy, e.g. with a VKA, is
recommended in a dose adjusted to achieve an INR value in the range of 2.0 –
3.0, unless contraindicated.
In patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 – 1, or where a more detailed stroke risk
assessment is indicated, it is recommended to use a more comprehensive risk
factor-based approach incorporating other risk factors for thrombo-embolism (see
Table 12 and Figure 7).56-58
In all cases where OAC is considered, a discussion of the pros and cons with the
patient, and an evaluation of the risk of bleeding complications, ability to safely
sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences are necessary.
In some patients, for example, women aged less than 65 years with no other risk
factors (i.e. a CHA2DS2VASC score of 1) aspirin rather than OAC therapy may be
considered.

cOAC, such as a VKA, adjusted to an intensity range of INR 2.0–3.0 (target 2.5). New OAC drugs, which
may be viable alternatives to a VKA, may ultimately be considered. For example, should both doses of
dabigatran etexilate receive regulatory approval for stroke prevention in AF, the recommendations for
thromboprophylaxis could evolve as follows considering stroke and bleeding risk stratification:
(a) Where oral anticoagulation is appropriate therapy, dabigatran may be considered, as an alternative to
adjusted dose VKA therapy. (i) If a patient is at low risk of bleeding (e.g. HAS-BLED score of 0–2; see Table
14 for HAS-BLED score definition), dabigatran 150 mg b.i.d. may be considered, in view of the improved
efficacy in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (but lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage and
similar rates of major bleeding events, when compared with warfarin); and (ii) If a patient has a measurable
risk of bleeding (e.g. HAS-BLED score of 3), dabigatran etexilate 110 mg b.i.d. may be considered, in view
of a similar efficacy in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (but lower rates of intracranial
haemorrhage and of major bleeding compared with VKA). (b) In patients with one ‘clinically relevant nonmajor’ stroke risk factor, dabigatran 110 mg b.i.d. may be considered, in view of a similar efficacy with VKA
in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism but lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage and major
bleeding compared with the VKA and (probably) aspirin. (c) Patients with no stroke risk factors (e.g.
CHA2DS2-VASC = 0) are clearly at so low risk, either aspirin 75–325 mg daily or no antithrombotic therapy is
recommended. Where possible, no antithrombotic therapy should be
considered for such patients, rather than aspirin, given the limited data on the benefits of aspirin in this
patient group (i.e., lone AF) and the potential for adverse effects, especially bleeding.

6.3 ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY
6.3.1 ANTICOAGULATION WITH VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS
There were 6 large randomized trials, both primary and secondary prevention,
that provided an extensive and robust evidence base for VKA therapy in AF.
In a meta-analysis55 adjusted-dose VKA (international normalized ratio [INR] 2-3)
showed a significant 64% risk reduction of stroke and 26% risk reduction of all
cause mortality in patients with non valvular AF.53,59-63
Risk of intracranial hemorrhage was small (0.3-1.8%).53,59-63 When VKA is given
to elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, hypertension must be managed
aggressively.
Patients with one ‘clinically relevant non-major’ risk factor are at intermediate risk
and antithrombotic therapy is recommended, either as:
IA
i. VKA therapy53 or
IB
ii. aspirin 75–325 mg daily50
Patients with no risk factors are at low risk (essentially patients aged <65 years
with lone AF, with none of the risk factors) and the use of either aspirin 75–325
mg daily or no antithrombotic therapy is recommended.53

and cognitively able to perform the self-monitoring test, and, if not, a designated
carer could help. Appropriate training by a competent healthcare professional is
important, and the patient should remain in contact with a named clinician.
These point-of-care devices may also be useful in remote places and allow
patients easy access to testing. Point-of-care devices also require adequate
quality assurance and calibration.
6.3.3 ANTICOAGULATION WITH DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS
Dabigatran etexilate is an oral prodrug that is rapidly converted by a serum
esterase to dabigatran, a potent, direct, competitive inhibitor of thrombin. It does
not require regular monitoring and has a serum half-life of 12 to 17 hours.
The Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY)
was a randomized trial comparing two fixed doses of dabigatran, given in a
blinded manner, with open-label use of VKA in patients with atrial fibrillation.58
Dabigatran 110 mg b.i.d. was non-inferior to VKA for the prevention of stroke
and systemic embolism with lower rates of major bleeding, whilst dabigatran
150 mg b.i.d. was associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic
embolism with similar rates of major haemorrhage, compared with VKA.
Where oral anticoagulation is appropriate therapy for patients with non-valvular
AF, dabigatran may be considered, as an alternative to adjusted dose VKA
therapy.
IB
There is currently no evidence to support the use of dabigatran for AF associated
with valve disease, prosthetic valve, in pregnancy and chronic renal failure.
Patients with AF who are indicated for OAC but are unwilling to go on VKA
because of the inconvenience, chronic oral anticoagulant therapy with dabigatran
150 mg twice daily may be considered, unless contraindicated.
IB
Where patients are at a higher risk of bleeding (HAS-BLED t3), dabigatran 110
mg twice daily may be considered, unless contraindicated.
IC

6.3.6 ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL COMBINATION
In patients with non valvular AF, adjusted dose VKA was found to be superior to
the combination of clopidogrel (75mg daily) plus aspirin (75-100 mg daily) for the
prevention of first occurrence of stroke, non-CNS systemic embolism, myocardial
infarction and vascular death.56
However, clopidogrel (75mg daily) plus aspirin (75-100 mg daily) conferred a
relative risk reduction of 11% compared to aspirin.57
There was an increased risk of major bleeding in patients receiving clopidogrel
plus aspirin compared to patients receiving aspirin alone and was broadly similar
to that seen with VKA.57
6.3.4 INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS
Several new anticoagulant drugs-broadly in two classes, another oral direct
thrombin inhibitors (e.g. AZD0837) and the oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban,
apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150, etc.)-are being developed for stroke
prevention in AF.
6.3.5 ANTIPLATELET AGENT ASPIRIN
Aspirin has been perceived to be safer than VKA in AF patients, but recent trials
have shown that VKA are substantially more effective than aspirin for stroke
prevention, with no difference in major bleeding event rates between VKA and
aspirin treated patients.55,68
In seven primary prevention trials, treatment with aspirin was associated with a
non-signicant 19% reduction in the incidence of stroke. There was an absolute
risk reduction of 0.8% per year for primary prevention trials and 2.5% per year for
secondary prevention by using aspirin. When data from all comparisons of
antiplatelet agents and placebo or control groups were included in the metaanalysis, antiplatelet therapy reduced stroke by 22%.55
The magnitude of stroke reduction from aspirin vs. placebo in the meta-analysis
is broadly similar to that seen when aspirin is given to vascular disease subjects.
Given that AF commonly co-exists with vascular disease, the modest benet
seen for aspirin in AF is likely to be related to its effects on vascular disease.
In the Japan Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Trial,69 patients with lone AF were
randomized to an aspirin group (aspirin at 150 – 200 mg/day) or a placebo
control group. The primary outcomes of cardiovascular death and non fatal
stroke or TIA was 3.1% per year in the aspirin group and was worse than those
in the control group, 2.4% per year, and treatment with aspirin caused a nonsignicant increased risk of major bleeding (1.6%) compared with control (0.4%).
The Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) study also
showed that VKA (target INR 2 – 3) was superior to aspirin 75 mg daily in
reducing the primary endpoint of fatal or disabling stroke, intracranial
hemorrhage, or thromboembolism by 52%, with no difference in the risk of major
hemorrhage between VKA and aspirin.68
x Minor Non-Invasive Surgery (e.g., dilation and curettage [D & C])
o Transient adjustment of the INR to below 1.5 for the perioperative
period is required.
In patients with AF who do not have mechanical prosthetic heart valves or those
who are not at high risk for thrombo-embolism who are undergoing surgical or
diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding, the interruption of OAC (with sub
therapeutic anticoagulation for up to 48 h) should be considered, without substituting
heparin as ‘bridging’ anticoagulation therapy. (see Appendix C.1.9 on page 80).
IIaC
In patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve or AF at high risk for
thrombo-embolism who are undergoing surgical or diagnostic procedures,
IIaC
Combination therapy with aspirin 75–100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily, should
be considered for stroke prevention in patients for whom there is patient refusal
to take OAC therapy or a clear contraindication to OAC therapy (e.g. inability to
cope or continue with anticoagulation monitoring), where there is a low risk of
bleeding.57
IIaB
In some patients with one ‘clinically relevant non-major’ risk factor, e.g., female
patients aged <65 years with no other risk factors, aspirin may be considered
rather than OAC therapy.
IIbC
6.4 ANTICOAGULATION IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
6.4.1 PERIOPERATIVE ANTICOAGULATION
Patients with AF who are anticoagulated will require temporary interruption of
VKA treatment before surgery or an invasive procedure. Many surgeons require
an INR less than 1.5 or even INR normalization before undertaking surgery. The
risk of clinically signicant bleeding, even among outpatients undergoing minor
procedures, should be weighed against the risk of stroke and thrombo-embolism
in an individual patient before the administration of bridging anticoagulant
therapy. (see Appendix C.1.9, page 80)
If the VKA used is warfarin, which has a half-life of 36 – 42 h, treatment should
be interrupted for about 5 days before surgery (corresponding approximately to
ve half-lives of warfarin),
Examples of procedures with a low risk of bleeding,
x Dental Surgery – Restorative Surgery and Extractions
o Anticoagulation can be continued with an INR of less than 3.0 and
appropriate topical haemostatic measures should be used. There is
no need to discontinue warfarin.
In cases of major surgery, consideration should be given to the risk of
thromboembolism. (see CHA2DS2Vasc scoring on page 29)
x Major Surgery (Interruption of Anticoagulation Required)
o In most people without mechanical prosthetic heart valves,
anticoagulation can be safely discontinued temporarily, without the
need for heparin cover. The decision is made on the basis of the
risk of thrombosis.

x In the presence of a large infarct, anticoagulation may be delayed after
2 weeks.
x In the presence of haemorrhage, anticoagulation should be withheld
until an appropriate time.
Patients with AF and a recent TIA should have imaging done to exclude cerebral
haemorrhage.
IIaC
x In the absence of a haemorrhage, anticoagulation should be started as
soon as possible.
In patients with AF who sustain ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism during
treatment with usual intensity anticoagulation with VKA (INR 2.0–3.0), raising the
intensity of the anticoagulation to a maximum target INR of 3.0–3.5 may be
considered, rather than adding an antiplatelet agent.
IIb C
6.4.3 Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Therapy Use in Patients With Atrial
Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
There is a lack of published evidence on what is the optimal management
strategy in anticoagulated patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who
undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, hence, need antiplatelet
therapy.
Based on consensus, the post-PCI strategy should be tailored to the individual
patient and their risk of thromboembolism and stent thrombosis weighed against
their risk of bleeding while receiving triple therapy (see Table 13)
Following elective PCI in patients with AF with stable coronary artery disease,
BMS should be considered, and drug-eluting stents avoided or strictly limited to
those clinical and/or anatomical situations (e.g. long lesions, small vessels,
diabetes, etc.), where a signicant benet is expected when compared with BMS.

‘bridging’
anticoagulation
with
therapeutic
doses
of
either
LMWH
or
unfractionated heparin during the temporary interruption of OAC therapy should

Following surgical procedures, resumption of OAC therapy should be considered
at the ‘usual’ maintenance dose (without a loading dose) on the evening of (or
the next morning after) surgery, assuming there is adequate haemostasis.
IIaB
When surgical procedures require interruption of OAC therapy for longer than
48h in high-risk patients, unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous LMWH may be
considered.

6.4.2 ACUTE STROKE

Patients with AF and an acute stroke should have imaging done to exclude
cerebral haemorrhage. In the presence of cerebral infarction, the decision on the
timing of anticoagulation should be weighed between the risk of haemorrhagic
transformation and the risk of recurrent thromboembolism.

after stroke.

6.4.4 NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
In patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, dual antiplatelet therapy
with aspirin plus clopidogrel is recommended, but in AF patients at moderate to
high risk of stroke, OAC should also be given.
In the acute setting, patients are often given aspirin, clopidogrel, UFH, or LMWH
(e.g. enoxaparin) or bivalirudin and/or a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI). Drugeluting stents should be limited to clinical situations, as described above (see
Table 13). An uninterrupted strategy of OAC is preferred, and radial access
should be used as the rst choice.
For medium to long-term management, triple therapy (VKA, aspirin, and
clopidogrel) should be used in the initial period (3 – 6 months), or for longer in
selected patients at low bleeding risk. In patients with a high risk of
cardiovascular thrombotic complications [e.g. high Global Registry of Acute
Coronary Events (GRACE) or TIMI risk score], long-term therapy with VKA may
be combined with clopidogrel 75 mg daily (or, alternatively, aspirin 75 – 100 mg
daily).
Following elective PCI, triple therapy (VKA, aspirin, clopidogrel) should be
considered in the short term, followed by more long-term therapy (up to 1 year)
with VKA plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily (or, alternatively, aspirin 75–100 mg daily).
IIaC
IIaC
Following elective PCI, clopidogrel should be considered in combination with
VKA plus aspirin for a minimum of 1 month after implantation of a BMS, but
longer with a drug-eluting stent (at least 3 months for a sirolimus-eluting stent
and at least 6 months for a paclitaxel-eluting stent); following which VKA and
clopidogrel 75 mg daily (or, alternatively, aspirin 75–100 mg daily).

6.4.5 CARDIOVERSION
For patients with AF or AFL of 48-h duration or longer, or when the duration of
AF or AFL is unknown, anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended for at
least 4 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after cardioversion, regardless of the method
used to restore sinus rhythm.64
IB
For patients with AF requiring immediate/emergency cardioversion because of
haemodynamic instability, heparin (i.v. UFH bolus followed by infusion, or weightadjusted therapeutic dose LMWH) is recommended.
IC
After immediate/emergency cardioversion in patients with AF of 48 hour duration
or longer, or when the duration of AF is unknown, OAC therapy is recommended
for at least 4 weeks, similar to patients undergoing elective cardioversion.64
I B
Following an ACS with or without PCI in patients with AF, triple therapy (VKA,
aspirin, clopidogrel) should be considered in the short term (3–6 months), or
longer in selected patients at low bleeding risk, followed by long-term therapy
with VKA plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily (or, alternatively, aspirin 75–100 mg daily).
IIaC
In anticoagulated patients at very high risk of thrombo-embolism, uninterrupted
therapy with VKA as the preferred strategy and radial access used as the rst
choice even during therapeutic anticoagulation (INR 2–3).
IIaC
When VKA is given in combination with clopidogrel or low-dose aspirin, careful
regulation of the anticoagulation dose intensity may be considered, with an INR
range of 2.0–2.5.
IIbC
Following revascularization surgery in patients with AF, VKA plus a single
antiplatelet drug may be considered in the initial 12 months, but this strategy has
not been evaluated thoroughly and is associated with an increased risk of
IIbC
bleeding.
In patients with stable vascular disease (e.g. >1 year, with no acute events), VKA
monotherapy may be considered, and concomitant antiplatelet therapy should
not be prescribed in the absence of a subsequent cardiovascular event.

Conversion of AF to sinus rhythm results in transient mechanical dysfunction of
the LA and LAA70 ("stunning"), which can occur after spontaneous,
pharmacological,48,71 or electrical71-73 conversion of AF. Thrombus may form
during the period of stunning and is expelled after the return of mechanical
function, explaining the clustering of thromboembolic events during the first 10 d
after cardioversion.74,75 Recovery of mechanical function may be delayed,
depending partially on the duration of AF before conversion.76,46,87
The risk of thromboembolism after cardioversion is between 1% and 5%77,78 and
is reduced when anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is given for 4 wk before and
after conversion79,80 (see Figure 9).

anticoagulation.
It is important to stress that in following cardioversion of all patients at high risk of
AF recurrence or with stroke risk factors, consideration should be given towards
long-term anticoagulation, as thromboembolism may occur during asymptomatic
recurrence of AF.
For patients with AF <48 h and at high risk of stroke, i.v. heparin or weightadjusted therapeutic dose LMWH is recommended peri-cardioversion, followed
by OAC therapy with a VKA (INR 2.0–3.0) long term.49,55,64

For patients undergoing a TOE-guided strategy in whom thrombus is identied,
VKA (INR 2.0–3.0) is recommended for at least 4 weeks, followed by a repeat
TOE to ensure thrombus resolution.
IC
If thrombus resolution is evident on repeat TOE, cardioversion should be
performed, and OAC should be considered for 4 weeks or lifelong (if risk factors
are present).
IIaC
If thrombus remains on repeat TOE, an alternative strategy (e.g. rate control)
may be considered.
IIbC
This strategy may be useful to allow early cardioversion of patients with AF ! 48
hours or where a minimal period of anticoagulation is preferred.
6.5 NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS TO PREVENT STROKE
The left atrial appendage (LAA) is considered the main site of atrial
thrombogenesis and thus, occlusion of the LAA orice may reduce the
development of atrial thrombi and stroke in patients with AF
The PROTECT AF trial81 randomized 707 eligible patients to percutaneous
closure of the LAA using a WATCHMAN device and subsequent discontinuation
of warfarin (intervention, n = 463), or to VKA treatment (INR range 2 – 3; control,
n = 244). The primary efficacy event rate (a composite endpoint of stroke,
cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism) of the WATCHMAN device was
considered non-inferior to that of VKA. There was a higher rate of adverse safety
events in the intervention group than in the control group, due mainly to
periprocedural complications.
6.6 RISK OF LONG-TERM ANTICOACULATION

patients before starting anticoagulation therapy.

IIbC
In order to provide adequate thromboprophylaxis with minimal risk of bleeding,
current clinical practice aims for a target INR of between 2.0 and 3.0; INRs of
more than 3.0 are associated with increases in bleeding and INRs of less than
2.0 are associated with increases in stroke risk.
The annual risks of intracranial haemorrhage increased from 0.1% in control to
0.3% in VKA groups, which represents an excess of two intracranial bleeds per
annum per 1,000 patients treated.
Even low-dose aspirin increases the risk of major haemorrhage by two-fold,
especially in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension.
Controlling and monitoring of hypertension and other associated co morbidities is
extremely important in minimizing the risk of bleeding in patients on prophylactic
OAC.
The fear of falls may be overstated, as a patient may need to fall 300 times per
year for the risk of intracranial haemorrhage to outweigh the benet of OAC in
stroke prevention.
While these factors are often cited as reasons for non-prescription of VKA in the
elderly, the absolute benefit is likely to be greatest in this same group in view of
their high risk.68
6.6.2 RISK SCORE FOR BLEEDING
The bleeding risk score HAS-BLED was formulated by incorporating risk factors
from a derivation cohort of a large population database of the prospective Euro
Heart Survey on AF.82 The clinical characteristic comprising the HAS-BLED
bleeding risk score is shown in Table 14.
It is reasonable to use the HAS-BLED score to assess bleeding risk in AF
patients, whereby a score of 3 indicates ‘high risk’, and some caution and
regular review of the patient is needed following the initiation of antithrombotic
therapy, whether with VKA or aspirin.
A schema such as HAS-BLED is a user-friendly method of predicting bleeding
risk and is easy to remember.
IIaA
Assessment of the risk of bleeding should be considered when prescribing
antithrombotic therapy (whether with VKA or aspirin), and the bleeding risk with
aspirin should be considered as being similar to VKA, especially in the
elderly.68,82,83
The HAS-BLED score [hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke,
bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly (>65), drugs/alcohol
concomitantly] should be considered as a calculation to assess bleeding risk,
whereby a score of  3 indicates ‘high risk’ and some caution and regular review
is needed, following the initiation of antithrombotic therapy, whether with OAC or
aspirin.82
IIaB
7 MANAGEMENT – LONGTERM RATE CONTROL
7.1 PHARMACOLOGICAL RATE CONTROL
Criteria for rate control vary with patient age but usually involve achieving
ventricular rates
x 60 - 80 beats per minute at rest and
x 90 – 115 beats per minute during moderate exercise.23
a ’Hypertension’ is defined as systolic blood pressure .160 mmHg. ‘Abnormal kidney function’ is defined
as the presence of chronic dialysis or renal transplantation or serum creatinine 200 mmol/L. ‘Abnormal
liver function’ is defined as chronic hepatic disease (e.g. cirrhosis) or biochemical evidence of significant
hepatic derangement (e.g. bilirubin .2 x upper limit of normal, in association with aspartate
aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase/alkaline
phosphatase .3 x upper limit normal, etc.). ‘Bleeding’ refers to previous bleeding history and/or
predisposition to bleeding, e.g. bleeding diathesis, anaemia, etc. ‘Labile INRs’ refers to unstable/high
INRs or poor time in therapeutic range (e.g.<60%). Drugs/alcohol use refers to concomitant use of
drugs, such as antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or alcohol abuse, etc. INR =
international normalized ratio.

Drugs commonly used are ß-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel
antagonists, and digitalis. Acute treatment is described in Section 5.1.1.
Combinations of drugs may be necessary. Dronedarone may also effectively
reduce heart rate during AF recurrences. Amiodarone may be suitable for some
patients with otherwise refractory rate control. The combination of a
ß-blocker and digitalis may be benecial in patients with heart failure.
When a strict rate control policy is adopted (resting heart rate < 80 bpm and a
target heart rate of <110 bpm during moderate exercise) a 24 h Holter monitor
should be performed to assess pauses and bradycardia.
Selection of the most effective and appropriate rate-control agent, or combination
of agents, is vital. Table 15 lists rate-control treatments in order of preference,
taking into account other conditions that may be present. Figure 11, page 47
provides an algorithm on how to make the drug choice and Table 16 list the
drugs and their doses for rate control.
Figure 10:Optimal level of heart rate control.
However, maintaining lenient control of heart rate (a resting rate of less than 100
beats per minute) is easier to achieve and is comparable to strict control (a
resting heart rate of 80 beats per minute and a heart rate during moderate
exercise of less than 110 beats per minute) on long-term composite outcomes.84
For patients without severe symptoms due to high ventricular rate, a lenient rate
control therapy approach is reasonable (See Figure 10).

Rate control using pharmacological agents (ȕ-blockers, non-dihydropyridine
calcium channel antagonists, digitalis, or a combination thereof) is recommended
in patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF. The choice of
medication should be individualized and the dose modulated to avoid
bradycardia.34
IB
In patients who experience symptoms related to AF during activity, the adequacy
of heart rate control should be assessed during exercise, adjusting
pharmacological treatment as necessary to keep the rate in the physiological
range.

In pre-excitation AF, or in patients with a history of AF, preferred drugs for rate
control are propafenone or amiodarone

Digoxin is indicated in patients with heart failure and LV dysfunction, and in
sedentary (inactive) patients.
Rate control may be achieved by administration of oral amiodarone when other
measures are unsuccessful or contraindicated.

appears more effective than the combination of digoxin with a CCB.89

control in patient with recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation.
7.2 NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL RATE CONTROL
7.2.1 AV NODAL ABLATION AND PACING
AV nodal ablation in conjunction with permanent pacemaker implantation
provides highly effective control of the heart rate and improves symptoms, quality
of life, exercise capacity, ventricular function and healthcare utilization in selected
patients with AF.90,100
Ablation of the atrioventricular node is a palliative but irreversible procedure and
is therefore reasonable in patients in whom pharmacological rate control,
including combination of drugs, has failed or rhythm control with drugs and/or LA
ablation has failed.
When the rate of ventricular response to AF cannot be controlled with
pharmacological agents or tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy is suspected,
catheter-directed ablation of the AV node may be considered in conjunction with
permanent pacemaker implantation.
47
Adapted from the ESC Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation (2010 Version) (European heart
Journal 2010; doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehq278)
Ablation of the AV node to control heart rate should be considered when the rate
cannot be controlled with pharmacological agents and when AF cannot be
prevented by antiarrhythmic therapy or is associated with intolerable side effects,
and direct catheter-based or surgical ablation of AF is not indicated, has failed, or
is rejected.90,100

Ablation of the AV node should be considered for patients with permanent AF
and an indication for CRT (NYHA functional class III or ambulatory class IV
symptoms despite optimal medical therapy, LVEF <35%, QRS width >130

IIa B
Ablation of the AV node should be considered for CRT non-responders in whom
AF prevents effective biventricular stimulation and amiodarone is ineffective or
contraindicated.
IIa C
In patients with any type of AF and severely depressed LV function (LVEF <35%)
and severe heart failure symptoms (NYHA III or IV), biventricular stimulation
should be considered after AV node ablation.

Ablation of the AV node to control heart rate may be considered when
tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy is suspected and the rate cannot be

Ablation of the AV node with consecutive implantation of a CRT device may be
considered in patients with permanent AF, LVEF <35%, and NYHA functional
class I or II symptoms on optimal medical therapy to control heart rate when
pharmacological therapy is insufficient or associated with side effects.
IIb C
In patients with any type of AF, moderately depressed LV function (LVEF <45%)
and mild heart failure symptoms (NYHA II), implantation of a CRT pacemaker
may be considered after AV node ablation.
IIb C
In patients with paroxysmal AF and normal LV function, implantation of a dualchamber (DDDR) pacemaker with mode-switch function may be considered after
AV node ablation.
IIb C
In patients with persistent or permanent AF and normal LV function, implantation
of a single- chamber (VVIR) pacemaker may be considered after AV node
ablation.
IIb C
Catheter ablation of the AV node should not be attempted without a prior trial of
medication, or catheter ablation for AF, to control the AF and/or ventricular rate in
patients with AF.

8 MANAGEMENT – LONGTERM RHYTHM CONTROL
The term ‘rhythm control’ encompasses the processes of conversion of atrial
brillation (AF) or atrial utter (AFI) to normal sinus rhythm, as well as the
maintenance of sinus rhythm.
Maintenance of sinus rhythm may also be referred to as prevention of AF/AFI
relapse or recurrence, and may be achieved by pharmacological or
nonpharmacological means, or both (hybrid therapy).
It is suggested that programming the pacemaker initially for the 1st month postablation to a higher nominal rate (90 beat per minutes) will reduce the risk of
sudden cardiac death.

The following are the guiding principles of antiarrhythmic drug therapy to
maintain sinus rhythm in AF:
(1) Treatment is motivated by attempts to reduce AF-related symptoms.
(2) Efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm is modest.
(3) Clinically successful antiarrhythmic drug therapy may reduce rather than
eliminate recurrence of AF.
(4) If one antiarrhythmic drug ‘fails’, a clinically acceptable response may be
achieved with another agent.
(5) Drug-induced proarrhythmia or extra-cardiac side effects are frequent.
(6) Safety rather than efficacy considerations should primarily guide the choice
of antiarrhythmic agent
8.1 EFFICACY OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS IN PREVENTING
RECURRENT ATRIAL BRILLATION
In a recent meta-analysis of 44 randomized controlled trials comparing
antiarrhythmic drugs against control,105 the antiarrhymic drugs signicantly
reduced the rate of recurrent AF. Overall, the likelihood of maintaining sinus
rhythm is approximately doubled by the use of antiarrhythmic drugs.106
Amiodarone was superior to class I agents and sotalol.
The number of patients needed to treat for 1 year was 2 – 9. Withdrawal due to
side effects was frequent (1 in 9 – 27 patients), and all drugs except amiodarone
and propafenone increased the incidence of proarrhythmia.105 The number of
patients needed to harm was 17 – 119. Most of the trials included in the analysis
enrolled relatively healthy patients without severe concomitant cardiac disease.
Although mortality was low in all studies (0 – 4.4%), rapidly dissociating sodium
channel blockers (disopyramide phosphate, quinidine sulfate) were associated
with increased mortality.
8.2 CHOICE OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS
Antiarrhythmic therapy for recurrent AF is recommended on the basis of
choosing safer, although possibly less efficacious, medication before resorting to
more effective but less safe therapy. Upon initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy,
regular ECG monitoring is recommended (see Table 16. page 45).
8.2.1 PATIENTS WITH LONE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
In patients with no or minimal heart disease, ß-blockers represent a logical rst
attempt to prevent recurrent AF when the arrhythmia is clearly related to mental or
physical stress (adrenergic AF). Flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or dronedarone
is usually prescribed as second line agents (Figure 12, page 50).107,108
In the absence of spontaneous reversion, cardioversion is chosen as part of the
rhythm-control strategy.
8.2.2 PATIENTS WITH UNDERLYING HEART DISEASE

disease. Medication may be initially based on the pattern of arrhythmia onset. Antiarrhythmic agents are

Cardiovascular disease has conventionally been divided into a variety of
pathophysiological substrates: hypertrophy, ischaemia, and congestive heart
failure (Figure 13). For each of these it has been recommended that specic
drugs be avoided.

Individual drugs and their main disadvantages are listed in Table 17.
Amiodarone is the most efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for the prevention of
recurrent AF. However, several meta-analyses105,109-111 have failed to identify a
benecial effect of amiodarone on cardiovascular outcomes. In view of the better
safety and potential outcome benet, dronedarone may be preferable as the rst
antiarrhythmic option, at least in patients with symptomatic AF and underlying
cardiovascular disease. Should dronedarone fail to control symptoms,
amiodarone might then be necessary.
Dronedarone can be used safely in patients with ACS, chronic stable angina,
hypertensive heart disease. Dronedarone should only be used in maintaining
sinus rhythm and in whose normal heart rhythm has been restored. Dronedarone
should not be used in patients with heart failure.112
8.2.2.1 Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy
In patients with LV hypertrophy, sotalol is thought to be associated with an
increased incidence of proarrhythmia. Flecainide and propafenone may be used,
but there is some concern about proarrhythmic risk, especially in patients with
marked hypertrophy (LV wall thickness >1.4 cm according to previous
guidelines), and associated coronary artery disease.
Since dronedarone was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in a large
study including patients with hypertension and possible LV hypertrophy, it is an
option for this population, although denitive data do not exist. Amiodarone
should be considered when symptomatic AF recurrences continue to impact on
the quality of life of these patients.
8.2.2.2 Patients with coronary artery disease
Patients who have coronary artery disease should not receive ecainide163 or
propafenone. Sotalol or dronedarone should be administered as rst-line therapy.
Dronedarone may be preferred based on its safety prole. Amiodarone is
considered as the drug of last resort in this population due to its extra-cardiac
side effect prole.
8.2.2.3 Patients with heart failure
Amiodarone is the only agents available in Malaysia that can be safely
administered in patients with heart failure.
Dronedarone is contraindicated in patients with all classes of heart failure.112 In
such patients, amiodarone should be used.
I A/C
Amiodarone is more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm than sotalol,
propafenone, ecainide (by analogy), or dronedarone (Level of Evidence A), but
because of its toxicity prole should generally be used when other agents have
failed or are contraindicated (Level of Evidence C).21,105,110,113
In patients with severe heart failure, NYHA class III and IV or recently unstable
(decompensation within the prior month) NYHA class II, amiodarone should be
the drug of choice.115
I B
In patients without signicant structural heart disease, initial antiarrhythmic
therapy should be chosen from dronedarone, ecainide, propafenone, and
sotalol.85,86,105,113-115

Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is not recommended for maintenance of sinus
rhythm in patients with advanced sinus node disease or AV node dysfunction

8.3 NONPHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY
There is a variety of alternative non-pharmacological therapies for the prevention
and control of AF.
8.3.1 LEFT ATRIAL CATHETER ABLATION
Catheter ablation of AF particularly circumferential pulmonary vein ablation
(isolation) in the left atrium represents a promising and evolving therapy for
selected patients resistant to pharmacological therapy.
Ablation is indicated in highly symptomatic, paroxysmal or persistent AF, despite
optimal medical therapy and in patients with minimal or moderate structural heart
disease.

A recent meta-analysis found a 77% success rate for catheter ablation strategies
vs. 52% for antiarrhythmic medication.117 Similar results have been reported in
other meta-analyses,118,-120 one of which showed that PV isolation for paroxysmal
or persistent AF was associated with markedly increased odds of freedom from
AF at 1 year.119
Ablation may particularly benefit younger patients with lone AF who are
frequently symptomatic and for whom long-term antiarrhythmic poses higher risk
and lifestyle cost.
For patients with either persistent AF or long-standing persistent AF, and no or
minimal organic heart disease, the treatment strategies and the benet – risk
ratio of catheter ablation are less well established. Extensive and frequently
repeated ablation procedures may be necessary in these patients, and it seems
reasonable to recommend that they should be refractory to antiarrhythmic drug
treatment before ablation is considered (See Figure 14).
Figure 14. Choice between ablation and antiarrhythmic drug therapy for patients with and without structural heart disease. Proposed integration
of antiarrhythmic drug and catheter ablation for AF in patients with relevant underlying heart disease and for those with no or minimal heart

appropriate. AF= atrial fibrillation; CAD = coronary artery disease; CHF = congestive heart failure; HT=hypertension; LVH=left ventricular
hypertrophy; NYHA=New York Heart Association; PVI=pulmonary vein isolation. Antiarrhythmic agents are listed in alphabetical order within
each treatment box. Please note that left atrium (LA) ablation as first-line therapy (dashed line) is a Class IIb recommendation for patients with
paroxysmal AF and no or minimal heart disease, who remain highly symptomatic, despite rate control, and who reject antiarrhythmic drug
therapy.
53
Adapted with modification from the ESC Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation (2010 Version) (European heart Journal 2010;
doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehq278)
For symptomatic paroxysmal and persistent AF in patients with relevant organic
heart disease, antiarrhythmic drug treatment is recommended before catheter
ablation. In such patients, successful ablation is more difficult to achieve. Major
symptoms should be associated with the arrhythmia to justify the procedure.
Ablation of persistent and long-standing persistent AF is associated with variable
but encouraging success rates, but very often requires several attempts.
Ablation of common atrial utter is recommended as part of an AF ablation
procedure if documented prior to the ablation procedure or occurring during the
AF ablation.18
I B
Catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF should be considered in symptomatic
IIa A
8.3.2 SURGICAL ABLATION
The major indication for surgical ablation of AF is the presence of both AF and
the requirement for cardiac surgery for structural heart disease.120,127,128 Standalone surgery for AF should be considered for symptomatic AF patients who
prefer a surgical approach, have failed one or more attempts at catheter ablation,
or who are not candidates for catheter ablation.
Surgical ablation of AF should be considered in patients with symptomatic AF
undergoing cardiac surgery. 120,127,128
IIa A
Surgical ablation of AF may be performed in patients with asymptomatic AF
undergoing cardiac surgery if feasible with minimal risk.
IIb C
Minimally invasive surgical ablation of AF without concomitant cardiac surgery is
feasible and may be performed in patients with symptomatic AF after failure of
catheter ablation.
IIb C
patients who have previously failed a trial of antiarrhythmic medication.31,117,122-125
Ablation of persistent symptomatic AF that is refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy
should be considered a treatment option.18
IIa B
In patients post-ablation, LMWH or i.v. UFH should be considered as ‘bridging
therapy’ prior to resumption of systemic OAC, which should be continued for a
minimum of 3 months. Thereafter, the individual stroke risk factors of the patient
should be considered when determining if OAC therapy should be continued.
IIa C
Continuation of OAC therapy post- ablation is recommended in patients with 1
‘major’ (‘denitive’) or >2 ‘clinically relevant non-major’ risk factors (i.e. CHA
2DS2-VASc score >2).126
IIa B
Catheter ablation of AF may be considered in patients with symptomatic longstanding persistent AF refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs.
IIb C
Catheter ablation of AF in patients with heart failure may be considered when
antiarrhythmic medication, including amiodarone, fails to control symptoms.29,30
IIb B
Catheter ablation of AF may be considered prior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in
symptomatic patients despite adequate rate control with paroxysmal symptomatic
AF and no signicant underlying heart disease.117

8.3.3 SUPPRESSION OF AF THROUGH PACING
Several studies have examined the role of atrial pacing to prevent recurrent
paroxysmal AF. In patients with symptomatic bradycardia, the risk of AF is lower
with atrial than with ventricular pacing.129 In patients with sinus node dysfunction
and normal AV conduction, data from several randomized trials support atrial or
dual-chamber rather than ventricular pacing for prevention of AF.130-133 Patients
with paroxysmal AF and symptomatic bradycardia should be referred for
electrophysiological review for consideration of atrial based pacing.
8.4 UPSTREAM THERAPY
Upstream therapy is a term used that relates to prevention or delaying of
myocardial remodelling associated with hypertension, heart failure, or
inammation (e.g. after cardiac surgery) and therefore may deter the
development of new AF (primary prevention) or, once established, its rate of
recurrence or progression to permanent AF (secondary prevention).135
Treatments with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs), aldosterone antagonists, statins, and omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are usually referred to as ‘upstream’
therapies for AF.
8.4.1 ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS AND
ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS
Primary prevention
In patients with congestive cardiac failure, several meta-analyses have shown
a signicant 30 – 48% reduction in risk of AF associated with ACEI and ARB
therapies.136-140
While in patients with hypertension, in meta-analyses, the overall trend was in
favour of ACEI- or ARB-based therapy, but only one meta-analysis has shown a
statistically signicant 25% reduction in RR of incident AF.138
ACEIs and ARBs should be considered for prevention of new-onset AF in
patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.136-140
IIa A
ACEIs and ARBs should be considered for prevention of new-onset AF in
patients with hypertension, particularly with left ventricular hypertrophy.138,141,142
IIa B
Upstream therapies with ACEIs, ARBs, and statins are not recommended for
primary prevention of AF in patients without cardiovascular disease.
III C
Keypoints
55
Keypoint
When ventricular pacing with dual-chamber devices is unavoidable because of
concomitant disease of the AV conduction system, the evidence is less clear that
atrial-based pacing is superior. Although atrial-based pacing is associated with a
lower burden of AF and stroke risk compared to ventricular-based pacing in
patients requiring pacemakers for bradyarrhythmias, the value of pacing as a
primary therapy for prevention of recurrent AF has not been proven.
IIaB
IIaB
IIaA
IIaB
Secondary prevention
Several relatively small prospective randomized controlled trials have
demonstrated that therapy with ACEI/ARB conferred an additional benet on risk
of recurrent AF after cardioversion when co-administered with antiarrhythmic
drug therapy, usually amiodarone, compared with an antiarrhythmic drug
alone.143,144 Meta-analyses driven by these studies have reported a signicant 45
– 50% reduction in RR of recurrent AF.136-139 Conversely, a double-blind,
placebo-controlled study failed to demonstrate any benet of therapy with
candesartan for promotion of sinus rhythm after cardioversion in patients who did
not receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy. 145
Evidence to support the use of ACEI/ARB in patients with paroxysmal or
persistent AF who are not undergoing electrical cardioversion remains
controversial.
Pre-treatment with ACEIs and ARBs may be considered in patients with recurrent
AF and receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy.136-138,143,144
IIb B
ARBs or ACEIs may be useful for prevention of recurrent paroxysmal AF or in
patients with persistent AF undergoing electrical cardioversion in the absence of
signicant structural heart disease if these agents are indicated for other reasons
(e.g. hypertension).136,146,147

At present, there is no robust evidence to make any recommendation for the use

8.4.3 STATINS
For post-operative AF, a recent systematic review,148 have reported a lower
incidence of new onset AF favouring statins. Some studies, particularly in
patients with LV dysfunction and heart failure, have shown a 20 – 50% reduction
in the incidence of new-onset AF.149
Statins should be considered for prevention of new-onset AF after coronary
artery bypass grafting, isolated or in combination with valvular interventions.

9 MANAGEMENT – SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Although AF may occur after noncardiac surgery, the incidence of atrial
arrhythmias including AF after open-heart surgery is between 20% and 50%.
Post-operative AF usually occurs within 5 d of open-heart surgery, with a peak
incidence on the second day. The arrhythmia is usually self-correcting, and sinus
rhythm resumes in more than 90% of patients by 6 to 8 wk after surgery.
A systematic review of 58 studies in 8565 patients has shown that interventions
to prevent and/or treat post-operative AF with ß-blockers, sotalol, or amiodarone
and, less convincingly, atrial pacing, are favoured with respect to outcome.153
9.1.1 PREVENTION OF POST-OPERATIVE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
ß-Blocker therapy is most effective when provided both before and after cardiac
surgery compared with only before or after surgery.153-155 Withdrawal of ßblockers is a signicant risk factor for the development of post-operative AF and
should be avoided. Treatment should be started at least 1 week before surgery
with a ß-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.
Prophylactic amiodarone decreased the incidence of post- operative AF156. The
benecial effect of amiodarone has been consistently demonstrated in a
systematic review.153The adverse effects of perioperative prophylactic i.v.
amiodarone include an increased probability of post-operative bradycardia and
hypotension.153
Sotalol has been reported to reduce the incidence of post-operative AF by 64%
compared with placebo.153 However, the use of sotalol places patients at risk of
bradycardia and torsade de pointes, especially those with electrolyte
disturbances, and its use in post-operative AF is limited.
Meta-analyses demonstrated that corticosteroid therapy was associated with a
26 – 45% reduction in post-operative AF and shorter hospital stay.157 However,
the potential adverse effects on glucose metabolism, wound healing, and
infection, make their use for prevention of AF as controversial.
One meta-analysis of eight trials has shown that prophylactic atrial pacing
reduced the incidence of post-operative AF regardless of the atrial pacing site or
pacing algorithm used. 153
9.1.2 TREATMENT OF POST-OPERATIVE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
In haemodynamically stable patients, the majority will convert spontaneously to
sinus rhythm within 24 h. Initial management includes correction of predisposing
factors (such as pain management, haemodynamic optimization, weaning of i.v.
inotropes, correcting electrolytes and metabolic abnormalities, and addressing
anaemia or hypoxia) where possible.158
In the highly symptomatic patient or when rate control is difficult to achieve,
cardioversion may be performed. DCCV is 95% successful but pharmacological
cardioversion is more commonly used. Amiodarone was shown to be more
effective than placebo in converting post-operative AF to sinus rhythm.
Short-acting
ß-blockers
(e.g.
esmolol)
are
particularly
useful
when
haemodynamic instability is a concern. Other atrioventricular nodal blocking
agents, such as non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, can be used
as alternatives, but digoxin is less effective when adrenergic tone is high. The
agents used for rate control of AF following cardiac surgery are listed in Table 15.
A number of studies have shown an increased risk of stroke in patients after
cardiac surgery. Anticoagulation with heparin or VKA is appropriate when AF
persists longer than 48 h.159 Standard precautions regarding anticoagulation
pericardioversion should be used (see Section 4.3).
Oral ȕ-blockers are recommended to prevent post-operative AF for patients
undergoing cardiac surgery in the absence of contraindications.153,154
I A
If used, ȕ-blockers (or other oral antiarrhythmic drugs for AF management) are
recommended to be continued until the day of surgery.154,155
I B
Restoration of sinus rhythm by DCCV is recommended in patients who develop
post-operative AF and are haemodynamically unstable.
I C
Ventricular rate control is recommended in patients with AF without
haemodynamic instability.155
I B
Pre-operative administration of amiodarone should be considered as prophylactic
therapy for patients at high risk for post-operative AF.153,154,160
IIa A
Unless contraindicated, antithrombotic/anticoagulation medication for postoperative AF should be considered when the duration of AF is >48 hours.159
IIa A
If sinus rhythm is restored successfully, duration of anticoagulation should be for
a minimum of 4 weeks but more prolonged in the presence of stroke risk
factors.159
IIa B
Antiarrhythmic medications should be considered for recurrent or refractory
postoperative AF in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm.
IIa C
Sotalol may be considered for prevention of AF after cardiac surgery, but is
associated with risk of proarrhythmia.153
IIb A
Biatrial pacing may be considered for prevention of AF after cardiac surgery.153
IIb A
Corticosteroids may be considered in order to reduce the incidence of AF after
cardiac surgery, but are associated with risk.157
IIb B
Atrial flutter is less common than AF after cardiac surgery,161 but
pharmacological therapy is similar. Prevention of postoperative atrial flutter is as
difficult as prevention of AF, but atrial overdrive pacing is generally useful for
termination of atrial flutter when epicardial electrodes are in place.

9.2 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME
AF occurs with an incidence between 2 to 21% in patients with ACS162 and is
more commonly associated with ACS in older patients and those with higher
heart rate and LV dysfunction.162
AF is associated with increased in-hospital mortality in the setting of ACS. Stroke
rates are also increased in patients with ACS and AF.
Specific recommendations for management of patients with AF in the setting of
ACS are based primarily on consensus, because no adequate trials have tested
alternative strategies.
III B
Administration of ecainide or propafenone is not recommended in patients with
AF in the setting of ACS.163
9.3 WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE (WPW) PRE-EXCITATION SYNDROMES̘
Since accessory pathways (AP) lack the decremental conduction properties of
the AV node, patients with overt pre-excitation and AF are at risk of rapid
conduction across the AP, resulting in fast ventricular rates and possible sudden
cardiac death (SCD) because of degeneration into ventricular brillation. This
makes AF in this patient cohort a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. For
information relating to acute and long-term pharmacological rate control in
patients with an AP, see Section 5.1.1, page 18.

9.3.1 SUDDEN DEATH AND RISK STRATIFICATION
The incidence of SCD in patients with the Wolff – Parkinson – White syndrome
has ranged from 0.15 to 0.39% over 3- to 22-year follow-up.
The markers of increased risk are:
x Shortest pre-excited RR interval <250 ms during spontaneous or induced
AF.
x A history of symptomatic tachycardia.
x The presence of multiple APs.
x Ebstein’s anomaly.
Since the efficacy of catheter ablation of APs is 95%, this is the management of
choice for patients with evidence pre-excitation and AF.16 Patients who have
survived SCD in the presence of an overt AP should have urgent AP ablation.
Successful catheter ablation in those patients eliminates the risk for SCD.
Patients with overt pre-excitation and high risk of AF, or patients with high-risk
professions such as public transport vehicle drivers, pilots, or competitive
athletes should be considered for ablation.
The indication for catheter ablation of an overt AP in an asymptomatic patient is
still controversial (especially in children).165 Most patients with asymptomatic preexcitation have a good prognosis; SCD is rarely the rst manifestation of the
disease.
The positive predictive value of invasive electrophysiological testing is
considered to be too low to justify routine use in asymptomatic patients. Catheter
ablation of an asymptomatic overt AP should remain a case-by-case decision
with detailed counseling of the patient (and family) about the natural course and
the risk of SCD versus the risk of an ablation procedure.
9.4 HYPERTHYROIDISM̘
AF occurs in 10% to 25% of patients with hyperthyroidism, more commonly in
men and elderly patients.
Catheter ablation of an overt AP in patients with AF is recommended to prevent
SCD.164
I A
Immediate referral to an experienced ablation centre for catheter ablation is
recommended for patients who survived SCD and have evidence of overt AP
conduction.
I C
Catheter ablation is recommended for patients with high-risk professions (e.g.
pilots, public transport drivers) and overt but asymptomatic AP conduction on the
surface ECG.164
I B
Catheter ablation is recommended in patients at high risk of developing AF in the
presence of an overt but asymptomatic AP on the surface ECG.166
I B
Asymptomatic patients with evidence of an overt AP should be considered for
catheter ablation of the AP only after a full explanation and careful counseling.166

Treatment is directed primarily toward restoring a euthyroid state, which is usually
associated with a spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm.
Antiarrhythmic drugs and direct-current cardioversion are generally unsuccessful
while the thyrotoxicosis persists.
The occurrence of hyperthyroidism following treatment with amiodarone is often
encountered in clinical practice. There are two types of amiodarone-induced
hyperthyroidism:
x Type I, where there is an excess iodide-induced production of T4 and T3
x Type II, where there is a destructive thyroiditis with a transient excess
release of T4 and T3, and, later, reduced thyroid function.
Although amiodarone may be continued when hypothyroidism has been
successfully treated with replacement therapy, it is necessary to discontinue
amiodarone if hyperthyroidism develops. Thyrotoxicosis may also occur after
cessation of amiodarone therapy.
In patients with active thyroid disease, antithrombotic therapy is recommended
based on the presence of other stroke risk factors.
I C
Administration of a ȕ-blocker is recommended to control the rate of ventricular
response in patients with AF complicating thyrotoxicosis, unless contraindicated.
I C
9.5. PREGNANCY
AF is rare during pregnancy and usually has an identifiable underlying cause,
such as:
o Mitral stenosis,167
o congenital heart disease,168 or
o hyperthyroidism.169
A rapid ventricular response to AF can have serious hemodynamic
consequences for both the mother and the foetus. In a pregnant woman who
develops AF, diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition causing the
arrhythmia are the first priorities.
When a ȕ-blocker cannot be used, administration of a non-dihydropyridine
calcium channel antagonist (diltiazem or verapamil) is recommended to control
the ventricular rate in patients with AF and thyrotoxicosis.
I C
If a rhythm control strategy is desirable, it is necessary to normalize thyroid
function prior to cardioversion, as otherwise the risk of relapse remains high.
I C
I C
Once a euthyroid state is restored, recommendations for antithrombotic
prophylaxis are the same as for patients without hyperthyroidism.
IC
Digoxin, a beta blocker, or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist is
recommended to control the ventricular rate in pregnant patients.170-172
Propranolol and metoprolol would be the beta-blockers of choice, while atenolol
is contraindicated. Atenolol given in the rst trimester, but not later, has been
associated with foetal growth retardation. Use of beta-blockers in the first
trimester is to be preferably avoided.

All currently available antiarrhythmic drugs have the potential to cross the
placenta and enter breast milk and should therefore be avoided if possible.
Quinidine,171 sotalol,173 and flecainide173 have all been used successfully for
pharmacological cardioversion during pregnancy, however, in relatively small
numbers of cases.
Quinidine (has the longest record of safety in pregnancy) or procainamide may
be considered for pharmacological cardioversion in hemodynamically stable
patients who develop AF during pregnancy.171,174
IIbC
DCCV can be performed safely at all stages of pregnancy, and is recommended
in patients who are haemodynamically unstable due to AF, and whenever the risk
of ongoing AF is considered high, for the mother or for the foetus. Foetal
monitoring should be done during and following the DCCV.
I C
The role of anticoagulation to prevent systemic arterial embolism has not been
systematically studied in pregnant patients with AF, but the arrhythmia is
frequently associated with conditions that carry a high risk of thromboembolism,
including congenital or valvular heart disease.
Protection against thromboembolism is recommended throughout pregnancy for
patients with AF except those at low thromboembolic risk. The choice of
anticoagulant or aspirin should be chosen according to the stage of pregnancy.
IC
Consideration should be given to avoiding warfarin because it crosses the
placental barrier and is associated with teratogenic embryopathy in the first
trimester and with foetal haemorrhage in the later stages of pregnancy.172-179
Heparin is the preferred anticoagulant because it does not cross the placenta.
Subcutaneous administration of LMWH in weight-adjusted therapeutic doses is
recommended during the rst trimester and the last month of pregnancy.
I B
Alternatively, UFH may be given, to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin
time to 1.5 times the control.180
IIbC
During the second trimester, consider oral anticoagulation for pregnant women
with AF at high thromboembolic risk.180
The following are guiding principles for the use of drugs in pregnancy:
o Frequent monitoring with ECG and drug levels is recommended to reduce
the risk of toxicity.
o If possible, start after 8 weeks of pregnancy or as late as possible.
o Use lowest effective dose.
o Low dose combination therapy preferable to higher dose single drug
therapy.
o Use older agents with longest tract record.
9.6 HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY̘
Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are at greater risk of
developing AF compared with the general population, and around 20 – 25%
develop AF with an annual incidence of 2%.
62
IC
IC
IIbC
IB
IIbC
AF is the major determinant of hemodynamic deterioration in patients with HCM
and symptoms can be ameliorated by restoration of sinus rhythm.
Amiodarone may be the most effective agent for reducing the occurrence of
paroxysmal AF and for preventing recurrence.
In chronic AF, rate control can usually be achieved with ß-blockers and
verapamil. AV nodal ablation with permanent ventricular pacing (to promote late
septal activation) may be helpful in selected patients.
Unless contraindicated, OAC therapy should be administered to patients with
HCM and paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF.
Outcomes after AF ablation in patients with HCM are favourable, but not as
successful as in unselected populations. LA ablation is signicantly better in
paroxysmal AF than in persistent AF. In addition, patients with marked atrial
enlargement and severe diastolic dysfunction are at high risk of recurrence.
The small series of surgical ablation (Maze-III procedure) in combination with
myomectomy when LV outflow tract obstruction was present, for AF in patients
with HCM showed no increase in operative mortality and a high proportion of
patients remained in sinus rhythm over a mean follow-up of 15 months.181
Despite conicting data, there seems to be an overall benecial effect of
myomectomy in reducing the burden of AF in HCM patients.
Restoration of sinus rhythm by DCCV or pharmacological cardioversion is
recommended in patients with HCM presenting with recent-onset AF.182
I B
OAC therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) is recommended in patients with HCM who develop
AF unless contraindicated.182

Amiodarone should be considered in order to achieve rhythm control and to

Ablation procedures (with concomitant septal myomectomy if indicated) may be

9.7 PULMONARY DISEASES̘
Supraventricular arrhythmias, including AF, are common in patients with COPD
and have adverse prognostic implications in patients with acute exacerbations of
COPD.
For patients who develop AF during an acute pulmonary illness or exacerbation
of chronic pulmonary disease, treatment of the underlying lung disease and
correction of hypoxemia and acidosis are the primary therapeutic measures.
IC
IIIC
Theophylline and beta-adrenergic agonist agents are not recommended in
patients with bronchospastic lung disease who develop AF.
Beta-blockers, sotalol, propafenone, and adenosine are contraindicated in
patients with bronchospasm.

Diltiazem or verapamil is recommended to control the ventricular rate in patients

alternative for ventricular rate control.
IIa C
Cardioversion may be ineffective against AF unless respiratory decompensation
has been corrected.
Direct-current cardioversion should be attempted in patients with pulmonary
disease who become hemodynamically unstable as a consequence of AF.
IC
In patients refractory to drug therapy, AV nodal ablation and ventricular pacing
may be necessary to control the ventricular rate.
In patients with AF and pulmonary disease, the general recommendations for
antithrombotic therapy apply.
9.8 HEART FAILURE
AF is a strong and independent risk factor for the development of heart failure,
and both conditions frequently co-exist.17,183 The onset of AF in a patient with
heart failure often leads to symptomatic deterioration, predisposes to episodes of
worsening heart failure, increases the risk of thrombo-embolic episodes, and
worsens long-term outcome.
In the initial approach to heart failure patients with AF, the following issues need
to be considered:17
x Potential precipitating factors and secondary causes should be identied
and if possible corrected.
x Background heart failure treatment should be optimized.
When ventricular rate control is required in patients with heart failure and AF, ßblockers are preferred over digitalis glycosides due to their rate-controlling effect
during exertion rather than only at rest. A combination of digoxin and a ß-blocker
may be more effective than a single drug for heart-rate control at rest. Therapy
with ß-blockers alone or in combination with digoxin was associated with lower
mortality rates compared with treatment with digoxin alone.184
ß-Blockers have favourable effects on mortality and morbidity in patients with
systolic heart failure. A recent meta-analysis also showed a 27% reduction in the
incidence of new-onset AF in patients with systolic heart failure treated with ßblockers.185
Although diltiazem effectively controls excessive heart rate during exercise, it
adversely suppresses myocardial contraction and increases the risk of heart
failure. For patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, these drugs
used in combination with digoxin appear to be more effective in controlling heart
rate over 24 h and during exercise than digoxin or non-dihydropyridine calcium
channel antagonist monotherapy.
The rhythm control strategy has not been shown to be superior to rate control in
heart failure patients with AF.27 Catheter-based LA ablation procedures in heart
failure patients may lead to improvement in LV function, exercise tolerance, and
quality of life in selected patients (see Section 8.3.1).29,30
64
IC
IIaC
DCCV is recommended when a rapid ventricular rate does not respond to
pharmacological measures in patients with AF and ongoing myocardial
ischaemia, symptomatic hypotension, or symptoms of pulmonary congestion.
I C
In patients with AF and severe (NYHA class III or IV) or recent (<4 weeks)
unstable heart failure, the use of antiarrhythmic therapy to maintain sinus rhythm
should be restricted to amiodarone.
I C
Administration of amiodarone is a reasonable option for pharmacological
cardioversion of AF, or to facilitate electrical cardioversion of AF.21,39,45,186
IIa B
In patients with AF and stable heart failure (NYHA class I, II) dronedarone should
be considered to reduce cardiovascular hospitalizations.
IIa C
The prevention of thrombo-embolism is covered in Section 6, but the presence of
heart failure due to systolic dysfunction is itself a risk factor for stroke and
thrombo-embolism, and OAC therapy is generally indicated when AF is present.
The use of aspirin is not recommended due to the increased risk of bleeding in
combination with OAC therapy and some evidence that aspirin may increase the
risk of hospitalizations for heart failure.
9.9 ATHLETES
In population-based studies, the intensity of physical activity showed a U-shaped
relationship with incident AF, which may indicate that the positive antiarrhythmic
effects of physical activity are partially negated when exercise is too
strenuous.188,189 AF is 2 – 10 times more prevalent in active or former competitive
athletes and those performing intense recreational endurance sports.190,191 The
reasons for this association are probably both functional (increased sympathetic
activity, volume load during exercise, vagotonia at rest) and structural (atrial
hypertrophy and dilatation).
Rate control is difficult to achieve in athletes. ß-blockers are not well tolerated
and may even be prohibited in some competitive sports, and digoxin or nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists will not be potent enough to slow heart rate
during exertional AF.
When the heart rate during AF is acceptable at maximal physical performance for
a given athlete without signs of haemodynamic impairment (dizziness, syncope,
sudden fatigue), competitive sports activity can be resumed.
Caution is necessary when using flecainide and propafenone as monotherapy in
athletes with AF.192 These drugs may lead to atrial utter, with 1 to 1 conduction
to the ventricles during high sympathetic tone. Therefore, ablation of the utter
circuit may be needed in athletes with documented atrial utter. Continuation of
drug therapy for AF will often be required despite successful ablation (‘hybrid
therapy’).
For patients with heart failure and symptomatic persistent AF despite adequate
rate
control,
electrical
cardioversion
and
rhythm
control
may
be
considered.27,29,30,32,187

In some athletes with paroxysmal AF, ecainide or propafenone can be used for
acute conversion (the ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ approach; see Section 5.1.2.1).42 These
patients should refrain from sports as long as the atrial arrhythmia persists and
until one to two half-lives of the antiarrhythmic drug have elapsed.
Non- pharmacological options such as catheter ablation can be considered.193
Anticoagulation may be necessary depending on the presence of risk factors for
thrombo-embolic events (see Section 6.1). However, anticoagulation cannot be
used in individuals participating in sporting activities with a risk of bodily collision.
9.10 VALVULAR HEART DISEASE
AF frequently accompanies valvular heart disease. LA distension is an early
manifestation of progressive mitral valve disease, and the presence of
paroxysmal or permanent AF is an accepted indication for early percutaneous or
surgical mitral intervention.66 AF is also frequently seen in later stages of aortic
valve disease when LV dilatation and elevated end-diastolic pressure exert
secondary effects on LA function.
Management of AF follows conventional recommendations in the setting of
valvular heart disease, although a rate control strategy is usually adopted
because of the low likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm in the long term.
Principal concerns surround the high risk of thrombo-embolism in subjects with
valvular heart disease, and a low threshold for anticoagulation is recommended
(See Section 6.1).
When a ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ approach with sodium channel blockers is used, sport
cessation should be considered for as long as the arrhythmia persists, and until
1–2 half-lives of the antiarrhythmic drug used have elapsed.
IIa C
Isthmus ablation should be considered in competitive or leisure-time athletes with
documented atrial utter, especially when therapy with ecainide or propafenone
is intended.

Where appropriate, AF ablation should be considered to prevent recurrent AF in
athletes.

When a specic cause for AF is identied in an athlete (such as
hyperthyroidism), it is not recommended to continue participation in competitive
or leisure time sports until correction of the cause.

It is not recommended to allow physical sports activity when symptoms due to
haemodynamic impairment (such as dizziness) are present.

10. REFERRALS
10.1 Acute hospitalisation/referral
This is required for patients with:
x AF/AFL with haemodynamic compromise, acute dyspnoea, acute heart
failure, chest pain, ischaemia, near syncope, hypotension
x AF/AFL with rapid uncontrolled heart rate, e.g., over 140 bpm at rest
x AF/AFL with acute systemic illness requiring acute management
x rst/new onset of AF/AFL symptoms, no contraindications to cardioversion,
with the possibility of cardioversion within 48 hours of onset.
10.2 Outpatient specialist physician/cardiologist
Outpatient specialist referral is recommended for those who:
x Need further investigation/echocardiography
x Have suspected structural heart disease (e.g., hypertensive, valvular,
ischaemic)
x Are to be considered for cardioversion
x Are highly symptomatic, requiring ‘maintenance of sinus rhythm’
antiarrhythmic therapy
x Are having difficulty with pharmacological rate control
x Require a second opinion of the risk/benet ratio of anticoagulation
x Are having syncopal attacks.
10.3 Cardiac electrophysiologist (heart-rhythm specialist)
Tertiary referral is recommended for patients who have:
x AF with WPW syndrome (pre-excited AF)
x Highly-symptomatic AF unresponsive to rst-line antiarrhythmic treatment
x Uncontrolled ventricular rate with maximally tolerated atrioventricularblocking therapy
x Recurrent AFL (including mixed AFL and AF where AFL is the dominant
arrhythmia)
x Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (sinus node dysfunction)
x Suspicion or documentation of a regular tachycardia triggering AF (e.g.,
SVT).
10.4 No referral
Referral is not needed for patients who have rate-controlled AF with mild or
occasional symptoms, for whom echocardiography is not required (e.g.,
previously obtained), and for whom the decision regarding stroke prevention
management is clear cut.
Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy should be considered for asymptomatic
patients with moderate or severe mitral stenosis and suitable valve anatomy who
have new-onset AF in the absence of LA thrombus.

APPENDIX C
C. WARFARIN IN PRACTICE
Barriers that may prevent people accessing medication and INR testing include:
• Financial barriers (including the ability to take time off work)
• Travel difficulties
• Lack of access to a telephone
• Fear or dislike of regular blood tests
• Difficulties with general practitioner monitoring.
Possible solutions include the following:
• Financial assistance from relevant agencies
• Provision of transport (e.g., shuttle service, taxi chits)
• Domiciliary testing, either at home or the work place
• Testing people in groups at a public health centre using a point-of-care monitor
C.1 INITIATION OF WARFARIN THERAPY
Loading doses are not recommended because they may increase the risk of
bleeding
Initiation of warfarin should be 5 mg daily in most patients (usually achieves INR
 2 in 4-5 days)
A starting dose < 5 mg should be considered for patients >65 yrs, liver disease,
malnourished, severe heart failure, or concomitant drugs affecting warfarin
metabolism.
If overlapping LMWH or heparin with warfarin, overlap for at least 5 days.
Discontinue LMWH or heparin when INR is therapeutic on two consecutive
measurements 24 hr apart.
C.1.2 Frequency of INR Monitoring:
Check baseline INR prior to ordering warfarin
Check INR daily (AM lab) until therapeutic for two consecutive days then twothree times weekly during initiation
C.1.2.1 Standard
Traditionally patients come into the clinic (or the hospital) to have venous blood
drawn for routine laboratory INR determination.
C.1.2.2 Point of Care
Finger tip capillary blood can be used with small, light weight and portable
instruments. The clinical trials result have compared favorably with traditional
INR determination.
Use in anticoagulation clinic.
Home use or Patient Self Test (PST)
x Need good quality control for point of care INR measurement.
o Patient selection is essential.
o Patients must have long-term indication for anticoagulation therapy.
o Patients must be willing and able to perform self-management.
o Patients must be willing to record results accurately and attend
clinics regularly for quality assurance.
o Patients must demonstrate competence in using the instrument and
interpreting the results.
o Patients must not have shown previous noncompliance in terms of
clinic attendance or medication management.
x Can increase INR testing frequency and decrease complications
associated with oral anticoagulation therapy.
C.1.3 Therapeutic INR Ranges:
AF alone: INR 2 – 3
Prosthetic Heart Valve: INR 2.5 – 3.5
C.1.4 Average Daily Dose
There are differences among various ethnic groups
About 4-5 mg/day or 28-35 mg/week for caucasian for target INR of 2.5 (2.0-3.0)
About 3-4 mg/day or 21-28 mg/week for Pacific-Asian (exclude caucasian in this
region). This dose will be less if target INR is recommended at <2.0.
C.1.5 Factors Effecting the Daily Dose
x Age ( For caucasian)
o <35 yr ----- 8.1 mg/day.
o 35-49 yr --- 6.4 mg/day.
o 50-59 yr --- 5.1 mg/day.
o 60-69 yr --- 4.2 mg/day.
o >70 yr ----- 3.6 mg/day.
x Genetic. Hereditary warfarin sensitive and resistance.
x Medicine noncompliance.
x Drugs interaction, including herbal medicine.
x Concurrent illness, fever, diarrhea, post op major surgery (i.e.. heart valve
replacement), malignancy, lupus anticoagulants.
x Impaired liver function, CHF with liver congestion.
x Food effect, vitamin K intake, alcohol.
x Hyperthyroidism, renal disease.
x During heparin and direct thrombin inhibitors treatment.
C.1.6 Warfarin Initiation
Day 1
(If there is an active or acute thromboembolic condition, warfarin should be
started along with heparin, unless there is a contraindication or patient cannot
take medicine orally. Following warfarin initiation, heparin should be continued
until INR reaches therapeutic level for 2 days).
5 mg (2.5-7.5). This dose is a good choice since it is known that average daily
dose is close to 5 mg. Using higher dose than necessary may lead to bleeding
complication due to rapidly and severely reduce factor VII. It may deplete protein
C too quick, and theoretically can cause hypercoagulable state. The 5 mg size
tablet is recommended for both inpatient and outpatient use, making inpatient to
outpatient transition more convenient. It is the most commonly used size tablet
by the majority of anticoagulation clinics today.
The higher dose warfarin initiation has also been tested successfully by using
normogram. It may be considered in patient who may need shorter period of time
to reach therapeutic INR. It should be done as inpatient. INR have to be done
frequently enough to prevent over anticoagulation and bleeding complication
Use lower dose (2.5 mg).
x >80 yr.
x Concurrent illness.
x On interaction drug.
x S/P major surgery, i.e. heart valve surgery.
x Chronic malnourished.
x Impaired liver function, liver congestion. 
Use higher dose (7.5-10.0 mg).
x Young healthy subject.
x In the first two days.
Day 2
A. If INR <1.5, continue the same dose.
B. If INR >1.5, give lower dose (2.5 mg or none)
Day 3
For #A. of Day 2
x If INR <1.5, suggests a higher than average maintenance dose of 5
mg/day or 35 mg/week will be needed. Give higher dose than 5 mg. i.e.7.5
mg for now.
x If INR 1.5-2.0, suggests an average maintenance dose close to 5 mg/day
or close to 35 mg/week will be needed, and continue 5 mg for now.
x If INR >2.0, suggests a lower than average maintenance dose of 5 mg/day
or 35 mg/week will be needed. Give less than 5 mg, i.e.2.5 mg or none for
now.
For #B. of Day 2
x If INR 1.5-2.0, suggests daily dose will be close to or less than 5 mg/day
or close to 35 mg/week or less. May give 5 mg or less for now.
x If INR >2.0, suggests daily dose will be lower than 5 mg/day or less than
35 mg/week. May give 2.5 mg or none for now.
Day 4
If there is no need for heparin therapy, the patient may have been discharged by
now, and warfarin initiation is continued as an outpatient.
x INR 2 times a week until INR is in target range twice in a row, then INR 1
time weekly until INR is in target range twice in a row, then INR 1 time in 2
week until INR is in target range twice in a row, then enter the patient in to
maintenance schedule (usually INR every 4 weeks).
x Patients during an acute illness, or post operative of major surgeries may
be more sensitive to warfarin than when they become more stable.
Out patient (See also "Day 4" above)
x Obtain baseline INR
x Start with 5 mg daily. See more detail for dose variation in "Inpatient
guideline"
x Check INR 2 times a week, or more often if necessary, during the first
week or so. Adjust warfarin dose and timing for INR check as outline in
"Inpatient" guidelines.
C.1.7 Ethnic Difference for Chinese-Asian or Pacific-Asian (exclude caucasian in
this region)
x Average daily dose of Warfarin for Pacific-Asian (exclude caucasian in this
region) or Chinese-Asian is about 3 mg. Weekly dose is about 21-28 mg,
or lower if "target INR" for various diagnoses are about 0.4-0.5 lower than
those of Caucasian-American-European level.
x "Target INR" for or Pacific-Asian (exclude caucasian in this region) or
Chinese-Asian should be lower than those of Caucasian-AmericanEuropean. The suggest level for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is 1.6-2.6, to
achieve less combine thromboembolic and major bleeding events. (Need
more database for confirmation)

C.1.8.1 Recommendations for Managing Elevated INRs or Bleeding in Patients
Receiving Warfarin:
Condition
Recommendation
INR above
therapeutic range
but  5; no
significant bleeding
Lower the dose or omit a dose and resume with lower dose
when INR therapeutic; if only minimally above therapeutic
range, no dose reduction may be required.
INR t 5 but  9; no
significant bleeding
Omit next one or two doses, monitor INR more frequently,
and resume with lower dose when INR therapeutic. If risk of
bleeding, omit the next dose and give vitamin K 1-2.5 mg
PO.
INR t 9; no
significant bleeding
Hold warfarin and give Vitamin K 2.5-5 mg orally; expect
substantial INR reduction in 24-48hr. Monitor INR more
frequently and repeat vitamin K if necessary. Resume
warfarin at an adjusted dose when INR therapeutic.
Serious bleeding at
any elevation of
INR
Hold warfarin and give vitamin K 10 mg slow IV infusion,
supplemented with FFP, prothrombin complex concentrate
or rVIIa, depending on urgency of situation. Vitamin K can
be repeated q12hr
Life threatening
bleeding
Hold warfarin and give FFP, prothrombin complex
concentrate, or rVIIa supplemented with vitamin K 10 mg
slow IV infusion. Repeat, if necessary, depending on INR.
Condition
Recommendations
Low risk of
thromboembolism
Stop warfarin 5 days before surgery allowing INR to return
to near normal. Bridge therapy with low dose LMWH or no
bridging.
Moderate risk of
thromboembolism
Stop warfarin 5 days before surgery allowing INR to fall,
start bridge therapy with therapeutic dose LMWH 2-3 days
prior to surgery (or when INR is sub-therapeutic).
Administer last dose of LMWH 24 hrs before surgery.
High risk of
thromboembolism
Stop warfarin 5 days before surgery allowing INR to fall,
start bridge therapy with therapeutic dose LMWH 2-3 days
prior to surgery (or when INR is sub-therapeutic).
Administer last dose of LMWH 24hrs before surgery.
Low risk of
bleeding
Lower warfarin dose and operate at an INR of 1.3-1.5; the
dose may be lowered 4-5 days before surgery; warfarin can
be restarted post-op, supplement with LMWH if necessary.
Urgent surgical or
other invasive
procedure (within
12 hours)
For immediate reversal give FFP, prothrombin complex
concentrate in addition to vitamin K 2.5-5 mg po or by slow
IV infusion.
C.1.9 Interruption of Warfarin Therapy for Surgery
Low risk: VTE: Single VTE occurred >12 months ago and no other risk factors,
AF: (CHADS2 score 0-2) without a history of stroke or other risk factors, Mech
heart valve: bileaflet aortic valve without AF and no other risk factors for stroke.
Moderate risk: VTE: VTE within 3-12 months, non-severe thrombophilic
conditions, recurrent VTE, active cancer, AF: (CHADS2 score 3 or 4), Mech heart
valve: bileaflet aortic valve and one of the following: AF, prior stroke or TIA, HTN,
DM, CHF, age >75 yr.
High risk: VTE: recent (within 3mo) VTE, severe thrombophilia, AF:(CHADS2
score 5 or 6), recent (within 3 months) stroke or TIA, rheumatic valvular heart
disease,
Mech heart valve: any mitral valve prosthesis, older aortic valve prosthesis
(caged-ball or tilting disc), recent (within 6 months) stroke or TIA
x Resume warfarin therapy 12-24 hrs after surgery and when there is
adequate hemostasis.
x Resume bridge therapy:
o Minor surgery or other invasive procedure and receiving therapeutic
dose LMWH: Resume 24 hrs after the procedure when there is
adequate hemostasis
o Major surgery or high bleeding risk surgery/procedure where postop therapeutic dose LMWH is planned: delay initiation of
therapeutic dose LMWH for 48-72 hours after surgery when
hemostasis is secured or administering low dose LMWH after
surgery when hemostasis is secured or completely avoiding LMWH
after surgery.
