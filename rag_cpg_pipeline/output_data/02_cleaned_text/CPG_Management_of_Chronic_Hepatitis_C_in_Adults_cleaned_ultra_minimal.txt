STATEMENT OF INTENT
These clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are meant to be guides for
clinical practice, based on the best available evidence at the time of
development. Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily
guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is
responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the
clinical picture presented by the patient and the management options
available locally.
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
UPDATING THE CPG
These guidelines were issued in 2019 and will be reviewed in a
minimum period of four years (2023) or sooner if new evidence becomes
available. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or
National Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A
discussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of
the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest
systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.
Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every
detail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or
omissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this
document, which is the definitive version at all times. This version can

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations were highlighted by the CPG
Development Group as the key clinical recommendations that should
be prioritised for implementation.
A. Screening, Diagnosis and Investigation
• Hepatitis C screening should be targeted for populations with
increased risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or exposure.
• Screening for HCV infection should be based on the detection of
antibodies to HCV by rapid diagnostic test or laboratory-based
immunoassay.
• Confirmation of active viraemia or ongoing chronic HCV infection
should be based on the detection of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or
HCV core antigen (HCVcAg).
• Non-invasive measures may be used to assess the degree of liver
fibrosis in hepatitis C.
B. Treatment, Monitoring and Follow-up
• Prior to initiation of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C,
 identify presence of co-morbidity and perform baseline
investigations
 assess for cirrhosis status
 evaluate for drug-drug interactions
 counsel to avoid pregnancy for female patient and female
partner of male patient during and six months after completion of
treatment
• All hepatitis C patients (confirmed viraemia) should be initiated with
DAAs within a year.
• In patients with hepatitis C and non-cirrhotic liver disease, the
combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir may be prescribed for
treatment.
• Routine laboratory monitoring shall be limited at week 4 of treatment
and 12 weeks post-DAA treatment for hepatitis C.
 Additional monitoring for full blood count should be done for
hepatitis C patients treated with ribavirin.
• HCV RNA should be used to assess sustained virological response
(SVR) 12 weeks post-DAAs.
 HCVcAg at 24 weeks (SVR24) may be used as an alternative.
• Screening for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma should be
continued 6-monthly for all cirrhotic hepatitis C patients.

MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) in its work process. The
quality of each retrieved evidence and its effect size are carefully
assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group. In formulating
the recommendations, overall balances of the following aspects are
considered in determining the strength of the recommendations:-
• overall quality of evidence
• balance of benefits versus harms
• values and preferences
• resource implications
• equity, feasibility and acceptability

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The members of the Development Group (DG) for these Clinical
Practice Guidelines (CPG) were from the Ministry of Health (MoH),
Ministry of Education and private sector. There was active involvement
of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the
CPG development.
A literature search was carried out using the following electronic
databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of
Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International
Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The
search was limited to literature published in the last ten years, on
humans, adults and in English. In addition, the reference lists of all
retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify
relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify
further studies. All searches were conducted from 3 January 2018
to 9 January 2019. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical
questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any
relevant papers published before 31 July 2019 to be included. Future
CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date.
The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from
the CPG Secretariat.
References were made to other guidelines on hepatitis C e.g.
• Guidelines for The Care and Treatment of Persons Diagnosed with
Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection (World Health Organization,
2018)
• EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C (European
Association for the Study of the Liver, 2016 and 2018)
• Hepatitis
C
Guidance
2018
Update:
AASLD-IDSA
Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis
C Virus Infection (American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases and Infectious Diseases Society of America, 2018)
A total of 11 main clinical questions were developed under five different
sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions
within five sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions).
The DG members met 18 times throughout the development of
these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least
two DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist,
presented in evidence tables and further discussed in DG meetings.
All statements and recommendations subsequently formulated were
agreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient,
the recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC.

iv
This CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, metaanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.
The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/
Canadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),
while the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of
GRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG strictly
follows the requirement of AGREE II.
On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external
reviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official websitefor
feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented
to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and
CPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval. Details on the
CPG development methodology by MaHTAS can be obtained from
Manual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based
Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at

Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
1. INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver
disease infection with worldwide approximation of 71 million people
being infected.1 In Malaysia, it is estimated that there are 453,700
people with anti-HCV positivity in 2009. The prevalence rate of people
living with HCV infection among those aged 15 - 64 years is 2.5%.2; 3
Many of the estimated 380,000 people living with hepatitis C remain
undiagnosed.4 Screening and access to care of HCV is crucial to
reduce the transmission and address the increasing disease burden
in the country.2 With the initiatives by the Ministry of Health (MoH)
Malaysia, in-line with World Health Organization (WHO)’s strategy
towards elimination of hepatitis C by 2030, screening and treatment of
hepatitis C has expanded tremendously. At present, MoH is focussing
on screening the high risk populations in particular people who inject
drugs (PWID). The landscape of treatment for hepatitis C has evolved
with the accessibility of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) which are
generally effective, well tolerated and given for 12 - 24 weeks.
Locally, the common genotypes found are genotype 3 (61.9%) and 1
(35.9%) which may give variation in treatment regime.5 People who
are HCV-infected are at risk of developing advanced liver disease,
contributing to the continuous rise in HCV-related morbidity and
mortality. Approximately 60 - 70% of chronically infected person will
eventually develop chronic liver disease of which 5 - 20% will have
cirrhosis of the liver and 1 - 5% will die of cirrhosis or hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).2
The primary goal of HCV treatment is to cure the infection i.e. to achieve
a sustained virological response (SVR). In view of high disease burden
and variation in practice, an evidence-based CPG is required to guide
healthcare providers locally in the management of hepatitis C.
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
2. SCREENING
Most chronic HCV infected individuals are asymptomatic and thus
unaware of their infection. Failure to identify them prevents linkage to
care and successful control of HCV. Therefore, screening of hepatitis
C is an important step towards improving detection and ultimately
treatment and cure of infected individuals.
• Hepatitis C screening is recommended for the following target
populations that have increased risk of HCV infection or exposure:6, 7
 current or past intravenous drug users
 healthcare providers, emergency medical and public safety
workers after needle sticks, sharps or mucosal exposures to HCVinfected blood
 recipients of blood/blood products/clotting factor concentrates/
organ transplant before 1994
 unexplained chronic liver disease and/or chronic hepatitis
including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels
 people who have exchanged sex for money, goods or favours
 men who have sex with men who have additional risk factors
including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
report of traumatic sexual practice (e.g. fisting), diagnosis of
lymphogranuloma venereum or syphilis, previous resolved or
treated hepatitis C infection, engaging in ‘chemsex’
 people with HIV infection
 current and past prisoners (incarceration)
 people on long-term haemodialysis (HD)
 children born to HCV-infected women
 intranasal illicit drug users - non-injecting drug users
In intermediate to high HCV-prevalence (>2%) countries, programmes
with pre-screening selection based on HCV risk profile or migrant
status and programmes in psychiatric clinics are associated with high
HCV prevalence.8, level III In contrast, programmes targeting healthcare
workers (Asian population involved in liver transplantation) and pregnant
women (obstetric/antenatal clinics in United Kingdom, US and Brazil)
have low HCV prevalence.9, level I
Increase in screening uptake for hepatitis C in primary care can be
achieved through targeted case finding, support and training of primary
care practitioners, alternative HCV testing methods and provision
of outreach testing. However, careful attention needs to be given
to resource implications and potentials for intervention to improve
outcomes once a positive diagnosis has been made in primary care.10, level I
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
Recommendation 1
• Hepatitis C screening should be targeted for populations with
increased risk of hepatitis C virus infection or exposure.*
*Refer to the preceding yellow box.
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
3. INVESTIGATION
3.1 Laboratory Test
Diagnosis of HCV infection is based on two categories of laboratory
tests:
• serological assays which detect antibody (anti-HCV) and antigen
(HCV core antigen/ HCVcAg)
• molecular assays that can detect and quantify HCV ribonucleic
acid (RNA)
These tests play a role in the diagnosis of infection, therapeutic
decision-making and assessment of virological response to therapy.
3.1.1 Screening Test
Screening for hepatitis C infection (to determine serological evidence
of past or present infection) in adults, adolescents and children (>18
months of age) is initiated by detection of a single test for anti-HCV
antibodies using either a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or laboratorybased immunoassay formats. Quality-assured RDT can be used in
setting where there is limited access to laboratory infrastructure and
testing, and/or in population where access to rapid testing would
facilitate linkage to care and treatment.11
• RDT
 Point-of-care testing
 Effective and affordable diagnostic tool
• Laboratory-based Immunoassays
 include
enzyme
immunoassay
(EIA),
chemiluminescence
immunoassay (CIA) and electrochemoluminescence assay
• Screening tests should meet minimum acceptance criteria of either
WHO’s prequalification of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) or a stringent
regulatory review for IVDs. All IVDs should be used in accordance
with manufacturers’ instructions and where possible at testing sites
enrolled in a national or international external quality assessment
scheme.
A diagnostic study evaluating the performance characteristics of
five anti-HCV RDTs showed that only Alere Truline, SD Bioline and
OraQuick RDTs had high sensitivity of >99% and specificity >98% and,
excellent inter-observer agreement and operational characteristics.12, level III
SD Bioline and OraQuick HCV RDT, immunochromatographic assays
for the detection of antibodies to HCV in human serum, plasma and
venous whole blood, have been accepted for the WHO list of prequalified
in vitro diagnostics. SD Bioline has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 97.76
to 100) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 98.85 to 100) while OraQuick
has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 97.8 to 100) and specificity of 99.7%
(95% CI 98.3 to 100).13, level III
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
Flowchart for serological testing is illustrated in Appendix 3.
Recommendation 2
•
Screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection should be based
on the detection of antibodies to HCV by rapid diagnostic test or
laboratory-based immunoassay.
3.1.2 Confirmatory Test
The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both
anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA or HCVcAg.14
•
HCV core antigen
In acute hepatitis C, HCVcAg (a viral protein) is found in the blood two
weeks after infection. It becomes detectable in blood a few days after
HCV RNA.
HCVcAg, which uses enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is a lowercost option than molecular test. However, it is less sensitive than HCV
RNA assay (lower limit of detection equivalent to approximately 500 to
3,000 HCV RNA IU/mL).14
Using a threshold of quantifiable HCV RNA (≥15 IU/mL), HCVcAg
demonstrates consistently high specificity (98 - 100%) at all time-points
but a wide range of sensitivity (31 - 100%). Among baseline samples,
there is a strong correlation between HCVcAg levels and HCV RNA
levels (rs 0.767 - 0.89, p ≤0.0001).15 - 16, level III
WHO has suggested that HCVcAg is too limited to recommend for its
use as a substitute for HCV RNA as assessment of test of cure, known
as SVR.17 However, EASL allows this as an alternative if the latter is not
available and/or not affordable to be done at SVR 24.14
•
HCV molecular
HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect the
presence of the virus, determine if the infection is active and if the
individual would benefit from antiviral treatment. This assay detects the
presence of viral RNA through targeting a specific segment of the virus.
The use of quantitative or qualitative molecular test for detection of HCV
RNA is recommended as the preferred strategy to diagnose viraemic
infection following a reactive HCV antibody serological test. The new
generation of quantitative and qualitative assays have the same lower
detection limit (around 15 IU/mL). However, quantitative assays are
a reproducible method to detect and quantify HCV RNA in plasma or
serum. Although quantitative RNA assays are considered the “gold
standard” assays for the diagnosis and monitoring of HCV, the high
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
cost of these assays and laboratory requirements means that they are
not readily available in resource-limited settings.17
• Both HCV RNA and HCVcAg are confirmatory tests indicating current
infection.
• The sensitivity and specificity of HCVcAg are 96.3 - 99.3% and 100%
respectively against HCV RNA (gold standard). HCVcAg can be used
instead of HCV RNA to diagnose acute or chronic HCV infection when
HCV RNA assays are not available and/or not affordable.17; 18 - 19, level III
• Hepatitis C is mandatory to be notified under the Prevention and
Control on Infectious Disease Act 1988 to the nearest District Health
Office within seven days of diagnosis.20, level III
•
HCV genotype
HCV strains are classified into six major genotypes and 67 subtypes.
The genotype of HCV for diagnosis is mostly determined by sequencing
of genomic nucleotide sequence or by kit-based assays which employ
complementary probes to report genotype present in a specimen.
Sequencing of highly conserved regions such as NS5, core, E1 and
5’UTR is the most recommended method used for genotyping of HCV.
Most of the laboratory are using in vitro reverse transcription-PCR in
plasma and serum from HCV-infected individuals. The limit of detection
of HCV genotype is 500 - 1000 IU/mL (depends on the type of reagents
used) to get an accurate HCV genotype result.
Testing for HCV resistance prior to treatment is not recommended.14
• In local setting where the choice of DAAs is limited, genotyping
is still recommended to determine the optimal regime in cirrhotic
population.
• Where new pangenotypic regimes are available, treatment can be
initiated without knowledge of the genotype and subtype.14
Recommendation 3
•
The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C should be based on the
detection of both anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and HCV
ribonucleic acid (RNA) or hepatitis C core antigen (HCVcAg).
•
Confirmation of active viraemia or ongoing chronic HCV infection
should be based on the detection of HCV RNA or HCVcAg.
•
All hepatitis C patients (confirmed viraemia) should be initiated with
direct-acting antivirals within a year.
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
3.2 Non-invasive Method of Liver Fibrosis Assessment
Accurate assessment on the severity of liver fibrosis is important for
prognosticate and treatment planning in HCV patients.
Non-invasive methods of assessing fibrosis have been developed to
reduce the need for liver biopsy.
A systematic review evaluates the ability of non-invasive measures
in assessing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis among chronic HCV
patients.21, level II-2
• A model using platelet count ≤140,000/mm3, three spider nevi,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >40 IU/L and male gender
predicted cirrhosis with an AUC of 0.938.
• AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) is simple to be used in estimating
fibrosis with AUC with a range of 0.87 - 0.89.
• For Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, the AUC was 0.765 for differentiating
Ishak 0 - 3 from 4 - 6. This was validated in a large cohort study
which demonstrated AUC of 0.85 for severe fibrosis and 0.91 for
cirrhosis.
• Transient elastography (TE) distinguished mild/moderate fibrosis
from severe fibrosis/cirrhosis with AUC of 0.94.

Although liver biopsy is the gold standard for detecting liver fibrosis
and cirrhosis, it is an invasive test with increased risk of morbidity and
mortality.
In two small diagnostic studies, the comparison of conventional
ultrasonography (USG) to liver biopsy showed a PPV of 78 - 80%.22 - 23, level III
The sensitivity was moderate at 68.18% but specificity was low at
14%.23, level III
TE has better sensitivity and specificity compared with conventional
USG or doppler USG. The AUC increases from stage F1 to F4 liver
fibrosis for both TE and US. However, the results are higher in TE.24, level III
The diagnostic accuracy is much better in TE compared with doppler
USG in F2 to F4 liver fibrosis. The AUC for TE in F2, F3 and F4 is 0.89,
0.96 and 1.0 respectively.25, level III
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
In a diagnostic study, TE and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)
had comparable accuracy in detecting all stages of liver fibrosis.
However, the TE examiners were not blinded on the clinical data of the
patients.26, level III
TE is available in limited centres whereas MRE is not available in
Malaysia. However, once MRE is available, it can be incorporated into
the MRI examination.
Recommendation 4
• Non-invasive measures* may be used to assess the degree of liver
fibrosis in hepatitis C.
• Transient elastrography (TE) is the preferred non-invasive imaging
modality for diagnosis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in hepatitis C.
 Ultrasound abdomen is an alternative modality if TE is not
available.

4. TREATMENT
4.1 Non-Pharmacological Treatment
HCV-infected patients should be counselled on the importance of
strict adherence to attain high SVR. It is a multidisciplinary approach
involving dedicated clinicians, pharmacists and nurses; it includes:
• HCV education
• monitoring services
• peer-based support
The following groups of patients will need additional support during
DAAs treatment:
4.2 Pharmacological Treatment
• Untreated chronic hepatitis C infection may lead to liver cirrhosis and
the risk of progression to cirrhosis varies according to the person’s
characteristics and behaviours.
• Alcohol use, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HIV coinfection and
immunosuppression due to any cause increase the risk of developing
cirrhosis.11
4.2.1 Pre-treatment assessment
Prior to initiation of treatment, hepatitis C patients must be assessed to
identify presence of co-morbidity and to determine cirrhosis status. The
following baseline investigations need to be performed:
• full blood count (FBC)
• liver function test (LFT) including AST
• serum creatinine
• international normalised ratio/INR (for all cirrhotic patients)
• HIV and HBsAg screening

For those with cirrhosis, assessment for compensated and
decompensated cirrhosis using Child-Turcotte-Pugh Score (CPS) as
shown below.
Table 2. Child-Turcotte-Pugh Score for Grading Severity of
Liver Disease
Source: Kumar P, Clark M. Clinical Medicine Seventh Edition. Saunders Elsevier; 2009
• A total CPS of:
 5 - 6 is class A
 7 - 9 is class B
 10 - 15 is class C
• CPS classes B and C are considered decompensated stage.
Counselling to avoid pregnancy during and six months after completion
of treatment should be given to both female patient and female partner
of male patient who are taking DAAs regime containing ribavirin. There
is lack of safety and efficacy data of DAAs in pregnancy.28
HCV-infected patients should be educated on the importance of
adherence to treatment and report on the use of all other medications
including recreational drugs.14
Pre-treatment assessment of concomitant medication should be done
to avoid drug-drug interactions (DDIs).EASL, 2018 About 30 - 44% of HCV
patients on DAAs and concomitant medications are at risk of clinically
significant DDIs. Potential DDIs are assigned to distinct risk categories
according to the predicted level of significance as below:29, level II-3
• Category 0 : interaction has not been assessed
• Category 1 : no clinically significant interaction expected
• Category 2 : potential interaction that may require close monitoring,
alteration of drug dosage or timing of administration
• Category 3 : co-administration either not recommended or contraindicated

Recommendation 5
• Prior to initiation of direct acting antivirals for hepatitis C,
 assess for cirrhosis status
 identify presence of co-morbidity and perform baseline
investigations as below:
- full blood count
- liver function test including aspartate aminotransferase
- serum creatinine
- international normalised ratio (for all cirrhotic patients)
- HBsAg screening
- HIV screening
 evaluate for drug-drug interactions
 counsel to avoid pregnancy for female patient and female partner
of male patient during and six months after completion of treatment
4.2.2 Direct-acting antivirals
Treatment for chronic hepatitis C has evolved from using pegylatedinterferon (PEG-IFN) with low cure rates and many side effects to
various regimes of oral DAAs. The aim is to provide high cure rate or
SVR by using drugs that are effective with short duration treatment
and minimal side effects. Hepatitis C patients (confirmed viraemia)
should be considered for DAA treatment except in those with limited life
expectancy or significant non-liver-related co-morbidities. Treatment
should be initiated without delay in those with significant fibrosis or
cirrhosis, including those with decompensated cirrhosis and clinically
significant extra-hepatic manifestations due to HCV infection.14
• In local setting, all hepatitis C patients (confirmed viraemia) should
be initiated with DAAs within a year.
• SVR12 is defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks posttreatment. It is considered equivalent to cure for hepatitis C infection.11
• SVR24 is defined as undetectable HCVcAg at 24 weeks posttreatment. It can be used as an alternative endpoint of treatment if
HCV RNA assays are not available and/or not affordable.14
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
The available DAAs are:
Ribavirin (RBV) is used in some combinations.
*Discontinued since 2019
• The choice of DAAs and treatment duration depends on stage of liver
disease.
• HCV genotype (GT) should be considered in cirrhosis.
Recommendation 6
• All hepatitis C patients (confirmed viraemia) should be initiated with
direct-acting antivirals within a year.

a. Treatment of non-cirrhotic liver disease
In a systematic review of 42 low-moderate quality primary papers,
various DAAs regimes showed high SVR12 rates in non-cirrhotic chronic
hepatitis C as summarised in Table 3. In the review, combination of
DCV and SOF showed high SVR rates with 12- and 24-week treatment
(96% to 100%).31, level I
In the relatively new combination of GLE/PIB, randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) had shown that non-inferiority or comparable results
between eight weeks and 12 weeks regime on non-cirrhotic HCV
patients.32 - 33, level I Both evidence are pharmaceutically-funded. The
fixed combination is yet to be made available in Malaysia. The findings
are also summarised in Table 3.

Recommendation 7
• In patients with hepatitis C and non-cirrhotic liver disease, the
combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir may be prescribed for
treatment. Other combination of direct acting antiviral may also be
considered*.
*Refer to Appendix 4.
b. Treatment of cirrhotic liver disease
•
Compensated liver disease
Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk for development of HCC
and the need for liver transplantation. The risk of cirrhosis at 20 years
after the infection with HCV ranges from 15% to 30%.34 - 35, level II-2 The
1-year mortality is 5.4% in compensated patients; those in stage 1 (no
varices) have longer survival than stage 2 patients (varices present).
36, level II-2 Cirrhosis can remain compensated for many years and it has
been reported that the median survival of patients with this condition is
more than 12 years.37, level II-2
In a systematic review, various DAAs regimes showed high SVR12
rates in cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C.31, level I All-oral, once-daily (GLE/
PIB) is effective for most patients with HCV (GT1, 2, 4, 5 or 6) and
compensated cirrhosis.38, level II-3 SOF/VEL/VOX (eight weeks) is not
non-inferior to SOF/VEL (12 weeks), but the two regimes have similar
SVR rates in patients with HCV GT 3 and cirrhosis.39, level I The above
findings are summarised in Table 4.

•
Decompensated liver disease
The number of decompensated cirrhosis caused by chronic HCV
infection is projected to rise. Infected patients with advanced fibrosis or
cirrhosis are at increased risk of both liver-related and all-cause mortality,
e.g. liver failure and HCC, and the need for liver transplantation.
Optimising HCV treatment outcomes for patients with advanced
liver disease remains an important objective because of the reduced
therapeutic responses often observed in this group and the potentially
life-threatening consequences of treatment failure.
The pan-genotypic combination of SOF, DCV and RBV achieves
SVR12 rates of 78 - 92% in the advanced cirrhosis cohort.40, level II-1
Rates of SVR are 83% (95% CI 74 to 90) in patients receiving SOF/
VEL for 12 weeks, 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98) among those on SOF/VEL
+ RBV for 12 weeks and 86% (95% CI 77 to 92) in those having SOF/
VEL for 24 weeks.41, level I
Treatment with SOF + DCV and SOF/VEL for genotype 2 or 3 who are
ribavirin ineligible is recommended for 24 weeks.28
SOF/LDV + RBV provide high rates of SVR12 for patients with
advanced liver disease in genotype (GT) 1 and 4, including those with
decompensated cirrhosis before or after liver transplantation.42, level I

Recommendation 8
• In patients with hepatitis C and decompensated cirrhosis, the
following combination of direct-acting antivirals may be used for 12
weeks:
 sofosbuvir (SOF) + daclatasvir (DCV) + ribavirin (RBV)
 sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) + RBV
 sofosbuvir/ledipasvir + RBV (for genotype 1 and 4)
• In patients with hepatitis C and decompensated cirrhosis with
genotype 2 or 3 and are ribavirin ineligible, SOF + DCV and SOF/
VEL may be given for 24 weeks.
c. Liver transplantation
HCV infection with advance cirrhosis or recurrence after liver
transplantation (LT) is associated with poor outcomes. Decompensated
liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C infection is an indication for LT because
of its risk of HCC. Reinfection of the grafted liver has increased risk of
progressive disease and graft loss.
An open label study assessed the safety and effectiveness of SOF, DCV
and RBV on patients with chronic HCV infection of any genotype and
either compensated/decompensated cirrhosis or post-LT recurrence. In
patients with cirrhosis, SVR12 rates were higher in patients with CPS
A or B (93%) vs CPS C (56%). In transplant recipients, SVR12 was
achieved by 95%. There were no treatment-related serious adverse
events. In post-LT patients, dose adjustment of immunosuppression
was needed but there was no graft rejection.43, level II-3
Another study on HCV recurrence after LT using combination of LDV
and SOF had shown an overall SVR12 of 96%. A total of 32% of patients
underwent adjustment in immunosuppression and one episode of mild
rejection was observed. However, there was no graft loss attributed to
HCV treatment.44, level II-3
A multicentre open label trial evaluated the effectiveness and safety
of GLE/PIB in chronic HCV treatment naive GT1 - 6 or treatment
experience GT1, 2, 4 - 6 infection, without cirrhosis and who had
received liver or kidney transplants for 12 weeks duration. The overall
SVR12 was 98% and the adverse events were mostly mild and rarely
of laboratory abnormalities.45, level II-3

5. SPECIAL GROUPS
5.1 Hepatitis B Co-infection
HBV/HCV co-infection is more common among PWID or in areas where
these two viruses are endemic. Co-infection of HBV/HCV increases risk
for HCC by 13.3%.46 HBV/HCV co-infected patients should be treated
similar to HCV mono-infected once HBV status has been assessed.
In a meta-analysis of 17 cohort studies on HBV/HCV co-infection
receiving DAAs treatment, HBV reactivation occurred more frequently
in patients with chronic [hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)] than
resolved [HBsAg-negative/hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive]
infection. The pooled proportion of patients who had HBV reactivation
was 24% (95% CI 19 to 30) in the former and 1.4% (95% CI 0.8 to
2.4) in the latter. In those with chronic HBV infection, the risk of HBVreactivation-related hepatitis was significantly lower in patients with
HBV DNA below the lower limit of quantification at baseline than in
those with quantifiable HBV DNA (RR=0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.50). Thus,
the use of antiviral prophylaxis might be warranted in HBsAg positive
patients, particularly those with quantifiable HBV deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA).47, level II-2

5.2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus Co-infection
HIV/HCV co-infected patients are at higher risk to develop liver-related
morbidity and mortality than HCV mono-infected patients. Fewer HIV/
HCV co-infected patients have been treated in DAAs trials; however, the
effectiveness rates among these groups have been remarkably similar
to the HCV mono-infected groups in the evidence discussed below.
Treatment of HIV/HCV co-infected patients requires special attention
due to the complexity of DDIs that can occur between DAAs and
antiretroviral medications.
• CPG DG suggests that antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be
initiated first and DAAs should be delayed in patients with HIV/
HCV co-infection. This is to allow viral suppression and to avoid the
difficulty in recognising ADR.
• If patients are not ready for ART, DAAs shall be considered if there
are no contraindications.
The DDIs are summarised in Appendix 6.
i. Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir
Two studies looked at the effectiveness of SOF+DCV in HIV/HCV coinfections. In ALLY-2 study, the combination of SOF+DCV once daily
for 12 weeks achieved SVR12 in 97% of treatment-naïve and 98%
of treatment-experienced HIV/HCV co-infected GT1 - 4 patients. The
combination was safe and well tolerated.48. level II-3 In another study,
various combinations of DAAs which includes SOF+DCV (25% of
patients) for 12 weeks were associated with 91% of SVR12 in GT1, 3
or 4 HIV/HCV co-infections.49, level II-2
The dose of DCV should be increased from 60 mg to 90 mg when
used with potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 e.g. efavirenz
(EFV), etravirine (ETV) or nevirapine (NVP). Meanwhile it should be
decreased from 60 mg to 30 mg when used with CYP 3A4 inhibitor
e.g. ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, cobicistat-boosted atazanavir or
elvitegravir/cobicistat. The usual dose of 60 mg should be used with
ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir.28
ii. Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir
Studies had shown that SOF/LDV for 12 weeks were associated
with high SVR12 rates of 96 - 100% in HIV/HCV co-infections.49 - 50, level II-2;
51 - 52, level II-3 The patients included those who had previous treatment
failure while receiving regimes that included DAAs and those with
cirrhosis.51, level II-3 None of the studies reported clinically significant
changes in HIV RNA levels, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
or change in estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). These
findings suggested that SOF/LDV was safe and effective regime for
HIV/HCV co-infected patients of all GTs (even though majority of the
participants were in GT1 infection).
LDV’s AUC decreases by 34% when co-administered with EFVcontaining regimes and increases by 96% when co-administered with
ritonavir-boosted atazanavir. Although no dose adjustments of LDV
are recommended to account for these interactions, the combinations
should be used with cautions and frequent renal monitoring.28
SOF/LDV increases tenofovir levels when given as tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate (TDF), which may increase the risk of tenofovir-associated
renal toxicity. This combination should be avoided in patients with an
eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2.28
iii. Grazoprevir/Elbasvir (GZR/EBR)
In HIV/HCV co-infections, GZR/EBR for 12 weeks:
• ± RBV achieve SVR12 of 93 - 98% in GT153, level I
• achieve SVR12 of 96% in GT 1, 4 and 6 including those with
cirrhosis54, level II-3
GZR/EBR is not compatible with any ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted
HIV protease inhibitor (PI), elvitegravir/cobicistat, EFV or etravirine.28
iv. Ombitasvir/ritonavir/Paritaprevir + Dasabuvir (OrPD)
OrPD with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks are associated with SVR12
between 91 - 94% in HIV/HCV GT1, 3 or 4 co-infections. No
treatment-related serious AEs occur.49 - 50, level II-2; 53, level I
OrPD should not be given to patients:28
• not on ART due to the potential risk for HIV PI resistance
• on rilpivirine and EFV due to potential risk of toxicity
OrPD is not recommended to be given together with ritonavir-boosted
lopinavir due to high cumulative dosage of ritonavir which may induce
severe gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.
v. Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (SOF/VEL)
SOF/VEL for 12 weeks is safe and achieves overall SVR12 of 95%
including in compensated cirrhosis and treatment-experienced HIV/
HCV co-infections.55, level II-3
SOF/VEL is not recommended to be used in patients on EFV or
etravirine. SOF/VEL increases tenofovir levels when given as TDF,
which may increase the risk of tenofovir-associated renal toxicity. This
combination should be used with caution with close monitoring of renal
profile in patients with an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2.28
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
vi. Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir/Voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX)
The SOF/VEL/VOX regime has not been studied in HIV/HCV co-infected
patients. Despite lack of data, it is highly likely that response rates in the
patients will be similar to those of HCV mono-infected patients.28
Recommendation 9
• HIV/HCV co-infections should be treated as HCV mono-infection.
 Potential drug-drug interaction should be assessed prior to
initiation and during treatment period.
5.3 Haemoglobinopathy
The prevalence of chronic HCV infection among thalassemia patients
varies widely and can reach up to 85%.56, level II-2 HCV was transmitted
mainly through blood transfusion before screening of blood donors was
introduced.57, level II-2
The EASL guidelines recommend DAAs for HCV infection in patients
with hemoglobinopathies. However, data regarding their use are limited.14
In a cohort study among various hemoglobinopathies (mainly
thalassemia major, HCV GT1b with previous PEG-IFN + RBV treatment
failure and cirrhosis) using DAAs including SOF-based regimes mainly
SOF + DCV and SOF + LDV ± RBV, high SVR12 of 93.5% had been
reported, similar to patients without hemoglobinopathies.57, level II-2
The blood unit transfused in the three months before, during and three
months after treatment did not increase in DAAs without RBV (mean unit
transfused 3.8 vs 3.7 vs 3.8 respectively); however, it was significantly
increased in the RBV group (3.6 vs 5.5 vs 4.0 respectively).57, level II-2
5.4 Immune-Complex Mediated Manifestations
HCV patients are at risk of developing extrahepatic manifestations that
include cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CV). Mixed cryoglobulinaemia
(MC) is a clonal disorder of B cells with a strong association to HCV
infection. HCV can lead to systemic vasculitis with immune complex
formation and deposition. Current therapeutic approaches are aimed at
elimination of HCV infection, removal of cryoglobulins and expansion
of B-cell clonal.
Patients with HCV-associated cryoglobulinemia treated with DAAs
show significant improvement in:
• virological response58, level II-3
• biochemical response58, level II-3; 59 - 61, level II-2
• clinical response59 - 60, level II-2
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
• immune response58, level II-3; 59 - 61, level II-2
• complete response58, level II-3
• Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score59, level II-2
DAAs are safe in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinaemia60, level II-2 with
mild adverse events (AEs).58, level II-3; 59, level II-2
Recommendation 10
• Patients with hepatitis C virus-associated cryoglobulinemia should
be treated with direct-acting antivirals.
5.5 Chronic Kidney Disease/End-Stage Renal Disease
HCV infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with
increased liver-related morbidity and mortality rates, accelerated
progression to end-stage renal disease and risk of cardiovascular
events.
A meta-analysis of 21 cohort studies of moderate quality showed
that regime including SOF could be proposed for HCV-infected CKD
patients with or without HD and should be associated with close clinical,
biological, cardiovascular and therapeutic drug monitoring.62, level II-2
Studies showed that a once-daily oral regime of GZV/EBR for 12 weeks
achieved high rates of SVR 97.4 - 99 % and had an acceptable safety
profile in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and advanced CKD
with or without dialysis.63 - 64, level I
Treatment with GLE/PIB for 12 weeks resulted in an SVR of 98% (95%
95 to 100) in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD and HCV infection.65, level II-3
• Patients with renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or
those with ESRD on dialysis, SOF-free regime should be preferred.
If there is no other choice, SOF-based regime may be used with
close monitoring and treatment should be rapidly interrupted if renal
function deteriorates.14
5.6 Pregnancy
Treatment of hepatitis C should not be initiated until pregnancy has
been excluded due to the lack of safety and efficacy data.28
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
5.7 Acute Hepatitis C
Most patients with acute hepatitis C are asymptomatic. Spontaneous
viral clearance varies from 14% to 50%. A minimum of six months of
monitoring for spontaneous clearance is recommended before deciding
to initiate treatment. If decision is to initiate treatment during the acute
infection period, HCV RNA monitoring for at least 12 to 16 weeks before
starting treatment is recommended. Patients who spontaneously clear
after acute hepatitis C, antiviral treatment is not recommended.28
Treatment recommendation is as described for chronic hepatitis C
treatment.
Recommendation 11
• Patients with acute hepatitis C should be monitored for six months
for spontaneous viral clearance before initiating treatment.
 Those who achieve spontaneous clearance should not be treated
with antiviral.
5.8 Hepatitis C in Children and Adolescents
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines
a child as an individual below the age of 18 years; WHO defines an
adolescent as a person between the ages of 10 and 19. Mother-toinfant transmission is the major route of infection in children while the
adolescents are at risk of infection via injecting drug use.
There are numerous trials of PEG-IFN and RBV in children. However,
current treatment options with DAAs are limited. The use of SOF/LDV
for 12 weeks in children ages 12 - 17, weighing greater than 35 kg
(genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6) have resulted in SVR rate of 98%. Combination
of SOF and RBV has also been proposed for genotypes 2 and 3 for
adolescents.11; 14
Adolescents aged ≥12 years, infected with genotype 2 or 3, who are
treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced, without cirrhosis or with
compensated cirrhosis (CPS A) can be treated with other regimens
approved for adults, with caution pending on more safety data in this
population.11; 14
In children younger than 12 years, treatment should be deferred until
DAAs, including pangenotypic regimens, are approved for this age
group.11; 14
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
6. MONITORING
The frequency of routine laboratory investigations and toxicity
monitoring can be limited at the start and end of treatment since the
DAAs are well tolerated.11
6.1 During and End of Treatment
The frequency of routine laboratory monitoring (LFT, serum creatinine)
shall be limited at week 4 and 12 weeks post-DAAs treatment.11
Besides these clinic visits, regular review by treating team is highly
recommended to ensure compliance.
More frequent monitoring e.g. FBC for drug-related AEs is necessary
for those treated with RBV.11; 28
In patients who need RBV, the dose should be adjusted downward
by 200 mg in decrement if the Hb level drops below 10 g/dL. RBV
administration should be stopped if the level drops below 8.5 g/dL.14
A 10-fold increase in ALT activity at any time during DAAs treatment
should prompt its discontinuation. An increase in ALT <10-fold that
is accompanied by any clinical symptoms (e.g. weakness, nausea,
vomiting, jaundice) or biochemical derangements (increased bilirubin,
alkaline phosphatase or INR) should also prompt discontinuation
of treatment. Asymptomatic increases in ALT <10-fold should be
closely monitored with repeat ALT testing at 2-week intervals. If the
levels remain persistently elevated, consideration should be given to
discontinuation of treatment.28
HIV/HCV
co-infection,
HBV/HCV
co-infection,
cirrhosis,
renal
impairment, presence of potential DDIs and ill-health patients may also
necessitate more frequent monitoring.11 Increment of indirect bilirubin
should be monitored in patients receiving OrPD. Renal function should
be checked monthly in patients with reduced eGFR receiving SOF.14
HCV RNA should be tested at 12 weeks post-treatment to assess the
effectiveness of the DAAs.
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
• Caution on risk of decompensation (first or worsening) in the following
group of patients during DAAs treatment:66, level II-3
 GT3 cirrhosis
 CPS of B or C
 albumin level <35 g/L
• Nucleic acid testing for qualitative or quantitative detection of HCV
RNA should be used as test of cure at 12 or 24 weeks (i.e. SVR12 or
SVR24) after completion of antiviral treatment.17
• Undetectable HCVcAg at 24 weeks (SVR24) after the end of
treatment can be used as an alternative endpoint of therapy, if HCV
RNA assays are not available and/or not affordable.14
Recommendation 10
• Routine laboratory monitoring* shall be limited at week 4 of treatment
and 12 weeks post-direct-acting antiviral treatment for hepatitis C.
 Additional monitoring for full blood count should be done for
hepatitis C patients treated with ribavirin.
*LFT and serum creatinine
6.2 Post-Treatment
Following DAAs completion, treatment effectiveness should be
determined by SVR12. However, periodic viraemia testing is
recommended for patients with ongoing risk of re-infection.39, level III
Patients who have achieved SVR should be discharged if they have all
of the following:
• no cirrhosis
• no ongoing risk behaviour
• no other co-morbidities
Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis significantly increase the risk of HCC
by 5- and 27-fold respectively, regardless of treatment status.67, level II-2
Patients with cirrhosis with SVR should undergo surveillance for HCC
6-monthly by ultrasound.14 In local setting, alpha-fetoprotein is also
done routinely for the same surveillance.
Patients who have achieved SVR should also be counselled
regarding sources of liver injury (e.g. alcohol, fatty liver, other potential
hepatotoxins), which can independently contribute to liver fibrosis
progression. They should be evaluated if serum levels of liver enzymes
are raised.39, level III
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
In patients with cirrhosis, surveillance for oesophageal varices should
be performed if varices are present at pre-treatment endoscopy.14
In PWID, the incidence of persistent re-infection is 1.7/100 person-years
(95% CI 0.8 to 3.1) among individuals with injecting drug use (IDU)
prior to treatment and 4.9/100 person-years (95% CI 2.3 to 8.9) among
those who has relapsed to IDU after treatment. Low education level
(OR=3.64, 95% CI 1.44 to 9.18) and lower age (<30 years) at treatment
(OR=7.03, 95% CI 1.78 to 27.8) are associated with relapse to IDU.68, level II-2
Thus, special consideration, e.g. harm reduction programme, should
be made available following successful HCV treatment in PWID as reinfection is possible with ongoing risk exposure.
Recommendation 11
• Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA should be used to assess the sustained
virological response (SVR) 12 weeks post-direct-acting antivirals.
 HCV core antigen (HCVcAg) at 24 weeks (SVR24) may be used
as an alternative.
• Screening for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma should be
continued 6-monthly for all cirrhotic hepatitis C patients.
6.3 Treatment Failure
For patients who have failed to achieve SVR12 (treatment failure) and
those who have not received treatment, regular follow-up should be
offered. Non-invasive methods for staging fibrosis are best suited in
the assessment at intervals of one to two years. HCC surveillance
6-monthly must be continued indefinitely in patients with advanced
fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis.14
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
7. REFERRAL CRITERIA
There is no retrievable evidence on referral criteria for patients with
HCV. Based on the consensus of CPG DG, patients with the following
features should be referred to centres with Gastroenterologists and
Hepatologists for further management:
• cirrhosis
• treatment failure
• hepatitis B co-infection
• CKD stage 4 and 5
• extrahepatic manifestation
• haemoglobinopathies
• solid organ transplantation
8. IMPLEMENTING THE GUDELINES
Hepatitis C treatment with DAAs is new in Malaysia and experience
on it is limited. It is important to implement this CPG as a guidance in
providing quality healthcare services based on best available evidence
applied to local scenario and expertise.
8.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors
The facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:
i. availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and
softcopies)
ii. conferences and updates on management of hepatitis C which
may involve professional societies e.g. Malaysian Society of
Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Malaysian Association of HIV
Medicine, Malaysian Family Medicine Specialist Association,
Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society, etc.
iii. public awareness hepatitis campaign which may involve other
government agencies and non-governmental organisations e.g.
World Hepatitis Day
Limiting factors in the CPG implementation include:
i. limited awareness and knowledge in the management of hepatitis
C among healthcare providers
ii. different levels of hepatitis C care due to expertise, drugs,
laboratory and radiology facilities
iii. challenges in managing hepatitis C with/in:
• renal failure
• thalassemia
• on-going risk factors
• incarcerated population
• DAAs resistance
Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults
8.2 Potential Resource Implications
To implement the CPG, there must be strong commitments to:
i. ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers via
printed copies and online accessibility
ii. reinforce training of healthcare providers via regular seminars and
workshops
iii. involve multidisciplinary team at all levels of health care
iv. improve the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities
v. train more experts in the field of hepatitis C
vi. strengthen the hepatitis C registry
To assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed
as clinical audit indicators for quality management:
*Target ≥70%
Implementation strategies will be developed following the approval of
the CPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module.
