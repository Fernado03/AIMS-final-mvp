Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
Guidelines Development
The work group for the development of these guidelines comprised paediatricians and a
pharmacist from various Ministry of Health facilities. These guidelines are based on the
findings of health technology assessment on the same topic, as well as a systematic
review of current medical literature, taking into consideration local medical practice and
local microbiology patterns and trends of antimicrobial resistance. The ranking of
evidence is based on a modified version of that suggested by the Catalonia Agency for
Health Technology Assessment and Research (CAHTAR) Spain, while the grading of
recommendations in these guidelines emulates those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network (SIGN). The draft guidelines were posted on both the Ministry of
Health Malaysia and Academy of Medicine, Malaysia websites for comment and
feedback. These guidelines have also been presented to the Technical Advisory
Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and Health Technology Assessment and
Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and
approval.
Objectives
The aim of this guideline is to aid doctors in general practice and pediatricians in clinical
decision making by providing well-balanced evidence based information on the rational
utilisation of antibiotics in selected paediatric conditions.
Clinical Questions
The clinical questions for these guidelines are:
(i)
Which are the situations in selected paediatric conditions where antibiotic
use should be considered?
(ii)
Which are the antibiotics recommended to be used in selected paediatric
conditions?
Target Population
These guidelines are applicable to paediatric patients with specific conditions.
Target Group
These guidelines are meant for all health care providers who provide clinical
management of children.
General Principles of Antibiotics Administration
1.
The choice of antibiotics should be based on the local prevalence of infecting
bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns, toxicity of antibiotics, results of
clinical trials, and host factors such as degree of severity and ease of administration
[Grade C].
2.
Initial antibiotic therapy should be continued for at least 3-5 days for Febrile
Neutropenia and for 2 -3 days in Meningitis, Community Acquired Pneumonia, Sepsis in
children and neonates to determine its effectiveness [Grade C].
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
3.
The choice of subsequent antibiotics should be guided by clinical response and
result of cultures and susceptibility [Grade C].

INTRODUCTION
Febrile neutropenia is a common consequence of anticancer chemotherapy, fever being
defined as a single oral temperature of more than or equal to 38.3°C with a neutrophil
count of less than 500 cells/mm3 (Hughes et al, 1997, level 2). Cancer patients receiving
myelosuppressive chemotherapy develop severe neutropenia and are at a high risk of
developing life-threatening infections (Charnas, Luthi & Ruch, 1997, level 1; Cometta et
al, 1996). Bacterial infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in
neutropenic cancer patients (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997, level 9), with a microbiologic cause
for the febrile episode being demonstrated in approximately 40% cases (Charnas, Luthi &
Ruch, 1997, level 1). These patients are at risk of endogenous flora, especially aerobic
Gram-negative bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract and also those pathogens
colonizing on normal or damaged mucosa or skin surfaces, like Gram-negative bacilli
(Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) or Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and viridans streptococci) (Charnas, Luthi & Ruch,
1997, level 1; Patrick, 1997).
Since febrile neutropenic patients fail to mount a full inflammatory response, and the
current diagnostic tests are not sufficiently rapid, sensitive or specific for identifying or
excluding the microbial cause of a febrile episode, these patients may have to be treated
empirically. The risk of infection increases ten-fold with declining neutrophil counts. It
has been shown that with absolute neutrophil counts between 100 and 500/mm3,
infection rates rise from 0.5 to 5 infections per 100 days, while 16 - 20% of patients with
neutrophil counts less than 100/mm3 have bacteremia (Hughes et al, 1997, level 1). The
prompt institution of empiric antibiotic therapy for febrile neutropenic patients, without
waiting 24 to 48 hours for the results of blood cultures, has been shown to dramatically
reduce infection-related morbidity and mortality in the cancer population undergoing
chemotherapy (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997, level 9). Empiric antibiotic therapy has become a
standard of care for the febrile neutropenic patient. Numerous clinical trials have
demonstrated that any one of a number of empiric antibiotic regimens may preserve the
patient through the critical time of fever and neutropenia, including a variety of antibiotic
combinations and more recently potent antibiotic monotherapies (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997,
level 9). Consequently, there is universal agreement in the literature that broad spectrum
antibiotics should be instituted for all cases of febrile neutropenia because of the
significant morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial sepsis in patients with fever
and cancer (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997, level 9 ).
2.
RECOMMENDATIONS
i.
Empirical broad spectrum antibiotics, covering both gram-positive and gram-
negative pathogens, should be commenced for all febrile neutropenic patients
[ Grade A].The choice of initial empirical antibiotics, however, remains
controversial (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Mustafa et al, 2001,
level 3; Duzova et al, 2001, level 3; Fleischack et al, 2001, level 2; Kebudi et al,
2001, level 3; Furno et al, 2000, level 2; Petrilli et al, 2000, level 3).
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
ii. Monotherapy with third-generation cephalosporins such as Ceftazidime (Ministry
of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Kebudi et al, 2001, level 3) and Ceftriaxone
(Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Karthaus et al, 1998, level 3) or
fourth-generation cephalosporins such as Cefepime (Ministry of Health Malaysia,
2003, level 1;Mustafa et al, 2001, level 3), or Imipenem (Raad et al, 1998, level 9)
and Meropenem (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Duzova et al, 2001,
level 3) are equally efficacious and safe compared to combination chemotherapy
with antipseudomonal beta-lactams and aminoglycosides [Grade A ]
iii. Instead of monotherapy, combination therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic and an
aminoglycoside can also be initiated, like combinations of Ceftazidime and
Amikacin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Hughes et al, 1997, level
2), Ceftriaxone and Amikacin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level
1;Charnas, Luthi & Ruch, 1997, level 1) and Piperacillin and Amikacin (Ministry
of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Hughes et al, 1997, level 2 ) [Grade A ] .
iv. In centers where Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcal areus(MRSA) is prevalent,
Vancomycin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Hughes et al, 1997,
level 2) may be considered in addition to broad gram-negative coverage with third
generation
cephalosporins
such
as
Ceftazidime,
or
fourth-generation
cephalosporins such as Cefepime [Grade C].
.
v. Antifungal therapy may be considered after 5-7 days of persistent fever in cancer
patients with febrile neutropenia who have received adequate and appropriate
antibacterial therapy [Grade B ].
vi. Routine antiviral therapy at the onset of febrile neutropenia is not recommended
[Grade C ].

COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA
1.
INTRODUCTION
Community acquired pneumonia may be defined as the presence of clinical signs and
symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child due to an infection acquired
outside the hospital (British Thoracic Society, 2002). However, definitive information
about causative organisms is seldom available at clinical presentation (McCracken, 2000),
and current diagnostic techniques are not sufficiently sensitive to detect all relevant
pathogens.
.
2.
AETIOLOGY
A causative pathogen is identified in 43% - 85% of community acquired pneumonias in
childhood (Wubbel et al, 1999, level 3; Juven et al, 2000; level 8), with a significant
proportion (8% - 40%) being mixed infections. Studies have shown prevalence of
particular pathogens at specific age groups as indicated below:
2.1
Bacterial Aetiological Agents
Streptococcus pneumoniae while being the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia
in children under 2 years (Drummond et al, 2000, level 8), remains an important
organism in the aetiology of community acquired pneumonias in children of all ages.
Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae become more prevalent with
increasing age from above 5 years (Heiskanen-Kosma et al, 1998, level 5;Wubbel et al,
1999, level 3).
2.2
Viral Aetiological Agents
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the commonest cause of lower respiratory infections
in infants and younger children (Sonoda et al, 1999, level 5; Videla et al, 1998, level 8;
Hijazi et al, 1997, level 8), while other viruses are Parainfluenza, Influenza, Adenovirus
(Juven et al, 2000, level 8;; Chan et al, 1999).
3.
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION
3.1
Clinical Diagnosis
Viral and bacterial pneumonia cannot be distinguished on clinical features alone.
However, clinical signs such as tachypnoea (defined by WHO’s ARI case management
guideline as respiratory rate > 60/min.in infants under 2 months, > 50/min in infants 2 –
12 months and > 40/min for children more than 12 months) is a useful sign, where the
severity of the tachypnoea relates to the severity of the illness. In children older than 3
years, pneumonia can occur even in the absence of tachypnoea.
Fever is an important clinical sign. A young child with mild symptoms and low grade
temperature is most likely to have a viral infection, whereas, high fever of more than
39°C with a history of rapid onset, with signs and symptoms of respiratory distress is
suggestive of pneumonia of bacterial origin.
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
Wheezing is likely to be associated with viral lower respiratory infection in younger
children. However, when wheezing is present in older school-going children associated
with fever, headache, arthralgia and cough, mycoplasma infection has to be considered.
While auscultatory findings are not useful in differentiating viral from bacterial causes,
the presence of staphylococcal skin infections or history of contact may point to the
probable cause causative agent.
3.2
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory investigations to establish the aetiological agent are not indicated in children
with community acquired pneumonias well enough to receive ambulatory treatment.
However, in children with pneumonias requiring inpatient treatment, investigations to
identify the probable aetiological agents should be carried out:
i. Culture of lung aspirate/pleural fluids, nasopharyngeal secretions and blood
sample. Invasive procedures like biopsy or needle aspirate of lung tissues are
rarely carried out in children with acute pneumonias. Where significant pleural
effusion is present, the pleural fluid is aspirated for culture, direct microscopic
examination and antigen detection. Nasopharyngeal bacterial secretions correlate
poorly while viral culture is time consuming. Blood culture should be done for
any ill child with pneumonia, for which most studies report not more than 10%
positive results.
ii. Rapid antigen identification for viral pathogens especially RSV should be
carried out for young infants with lower respiratory tract infections.
iii. Serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumonie, if available, may be
considered to assist in the management of suspected cases.
4.
MANAGEMENT
Pneumonia in young children with mild symptoms of lower respiratory infections are
likely to be viral in aetiology and hence antibiotics need not be used [Grade B ]
4.1
Empirical Treatment
Children of all age groups who are toxic, febrile (temperature >39°C) and with
respiratory distress (tachypnoea or difficulty in breathing) are most likely to have
bacterial pneumonias that warrant empirical antibiotic therapy.
For ambulatory treatment, oral Amoxicillin is recommended for children aged 5 years or
below, and Macrolides for older children and adolescents (Ministry of Health Malaysia,
2003, level 1;Grant & Ingram, 2000, level 9) [Grade B ]
For hospitalized patients, Penicillin, Macrolides or Cefuroxime plus Macrolides are
recommended (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Ruskanen & Mertsole, 1999,
level 9). In ill young patients where Staphylococcus pneumonia is suspected, intravenous
Cloxacillin or Flucloxacillin should be added ( Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;
Straus et al, 1998, level 1) [Grade A]
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
4.2
Specific Treatment
Specific therapy can be instituted if the causative organism is identified by culture or
antigen detection.
a) Pneumonia due to Pneumococcus, Group A Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae b
- Amoxycillin-Clavulanate , Amoxycillin, Penicillin G or Cefuroxime ( Ministry
of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Olivier, 2000, level 9; Wubbel et al, 1999, level 1;
Grimwood et al, 1997, level 9) [Grade B]
b) Pneumonia due to penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae
- No significant difference in response to conventional antibiotic regimes
( Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Tan et al, 1998, level 8)
c) Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae
- Macrolides is recommended as empirical antimicrobial treatment in children 5
years and above. Of the Macrolides, Azithromycin has better eradication of C.
pneumoniae and M .pneumoniae (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;
Harris et al, 1998, level 1). Macrolides is considered since C pneumoniae is an
important cause of community acquired pneumonia in school children (Ministry
of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Heiskanan–Kosma et al, 1999, level 8) [Grade

BACTERIAL MENINGITIS
1.
INTRODUCTION
Bacterial meningitis is defined as an inflammation of the pia – arachnoid meninges and
the fluid residing in the space that it encloses. The infective agent upon entry will extend
to all the sub-arachnoid space, which is continuous around the brain, spinal cord and
optic nerves. The ventricular fluid becomes infected as well.
Aseptic meningitis refers to meningitis with CSF pleocytosis but an aetiological agent is
not apparent on CSF gram stain and bacterial culture. Clinicians who assess children with
aseptic meningitis recognize that the majority of cases are caused by viruses but are often
faced with having to exclude partially treated bacterial meningitis in children who had
been on oral antibiotics.
1.1
Bacterial meningitis
Bacterial meningitis in children between 2 months to 12 years of age in Malaysia is
usually due to Haemophilus influenza type B Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria
meningitides (Limcangco et al, 2000, level 8; Uduman et al, 2000, level 8; Lee, 1998,
level 8; Hussein et al, 1998, level 8; Almuneef et al, 1998, level 8) If there are alterations
of host defense mechanisms there is an increased risk of meningitis from less common
pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes.
2.
EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIBIOTIC USE
2.1
Haemophilus Influenza type b Meningitis
Local data from the 1970’s through mid 1990’s have revealed Haemophilus influenza
type b as the leading pathogen in childhood bacterial meningitis (Ministry of Health
Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Hussein et al, 1998; level 8; Choo et al, 1990; level 8).
Antibiotics like Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol all cross the
blood brain barrier during acute inflammation in concentrations adequate to render them
effective.
Recent reviews from Taiwan (Ma et al, 2000; level 7), USA (Dawson et al 1999, level 7),
Canada (Gold, 1999, level 7), Greece (Syriopoulou et al, 2000, level 7) and Italy (Principi,
2000, level 7) have reported a marked decline in the incidence of Haemophilus influenza
meningitis following the success of the conjugate HIB vaccines.
2.2
Streptococcus pneumoniae Meningitis
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in USA, Canada
and several European countries. Historically, penicillin, a cheap and safe antibiotic , has
been the treatment of choice. Chloramphenicol monotherapy has been used in the past but
treatment failures have been reported (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Jadavji,
1986, level 6)
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
2.3
Penicillin Resistant Streptococcus Pneumoniae Meningitis
The incidence of reported Penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (not
exclusive to meningitis alone) from various countries are 1% in Taiwan, 10.2% in Italy,
11% in Sweden, 12.7% in USA, and 13% in Canada in 1998. In Malaysia there has been
an increase from 2.4% to 7% in 1978-1988 to 8% in 1995 - 1996 (Ministry of Health
Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Ma et al, 2000, level 7, Principi, 2000, level 7; Eriksson et al,
2000, level 7; Moshe Arditi et al, 1998, level 5; Scheifele et al, 2000, level 7).
In response to the increasing trend of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, both
the American Academy of Paediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society have
recommended empirical antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis, comprising a
combination of IV Vancomycin plus either IV Cefotaxime or Ceftriaxone for all children
1 month or more in age with probable or definite meningitis (Ministry of Health Malaysia,
2003, level 1; Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Canadian Paediatric
Society 2001, level 4).
The third generation cephalosporins such as Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime are the next
antibiotic of choice, with approximately 50% penicillin resistant Streptococcus
pneumoniae being also resistant to both Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime (Ministry of Health
Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Canadian
Paediatric Society, 2001, level 4).
New vaccination strategies against pneumococcus are being developed, but are facing
difficulties due to the significant variation in the population of isolates. A 23 valent
vaccine has been available since the 1980s but provokes less antibody response in
children less than 2 years (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Scheifele, 2000,
level 7).
2.4
Neisseria Meningitides Meningitis
Neisseria meningitides serogroup A, B and C are the causative organisms for meningitis.
While N. meningitides meningitis is not common in Malaysia, occasionally children may
be at risk of exposure from their relatives who have returned after performing the Haj.
Intravenous Penicillin remains the drug of choice. Chloramphenicol still provides
effective treatment for patients who are allergic to Penicillin. In 2000, it was reported that
there were 38 cases of serogroup W135 Neisseria meningitides in England and Wales, of
whom 80% that had died had received serogroup C vaccine previously (Ministry of
Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Bolt et al 2001 level 8). This has highlighted the need for
continuing epidemiological vigilance. The quadrivalent A, C, Y, W 135 is replacing the
previously bivalent vaccine.
3.
ADJUVANT DEXAMETHASONE ADMINISTRATION IN BACTERIAL
MENINGITIS.
Dexamethasone reduces the inflammatory response in CSF in bacterial meningitis, but
also reduces the penetration of antibiotics, especially Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, into
the CSF. A meta-analysis supports the use of Dexamethasone only for Haemophilus
influenza meningitis whether administered before or after antibiotic treatment (Ministry
of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; McIntyre et al, 1997, level 1). While those receiving
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
Dexamethasone had less hearing deficit episodes, this was of no benefit in reducing the
incidences of neurological deficits. A similar finding has been reported for Streptococcus
pneumoniae meningitis (Moshe et al, 1998, level 7). There is no evidence to support
Dexamethasone use for Neisseria meningitis (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;
McIntyre et al, 1997, level 1).
4.
RECOMMENDATIONS
i
Empirical treatment of bacterial meningitis should be a combination of crystalline
Penicillin and a third generation cephalosporin [Grade B]
ii
Definitive therapy and duration of therapy should be guided by susceptibility
results of the organism identified [Grade C]
iii. Penicillin is recommended for meningitis caused by penicillin-susceptible
Pneumococcus and Neisseria meningitides.[Grade B]
iv.. For penicillin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis, a combination of vancomycin
and third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is
recommended. [Grade B]
v. For Hib meningitis , cefotaxime or ceftriaxone or ampicillin(non-beta lactamase
producer) or chloramphenicol is recommended. [Grade B]
vi.
It is difficult to recommend the routine use of dexamethasone as the causative
organism is not known in most cases, and the initial dose of dexamethasone is
effective mainly for Haemophilus influenza meningitis. [Grade A]
Recommended doses of antibiotics are indicated in Appendix 1

SEPSIS IN CHILDREN
1.
INTRODUCTION
Sepsis and septic shock constitute an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
critically ill children, with approximately 2% of all hospitalized patients having sepsis.
The outcome is affected by the causative agents, with infections due to gram negative
rods having a significantly higher mortality (25%) than gram-positive bacteria (10%)
(Oda & Matsuo, 2000, level 7). In Kuwait it was found that 52% of the 70 deaths in
patients were due to nosocomial bacteremia (Jamal & El-Din, 1999, level 7).
2.
INVESTIGATIONS
Rapid identification of the causative agents in septicaemia is crucial for selecting
appropriate antimicrobial agents. It has been suggested that Fluorescent in-situ
hybridization (FISH) with ribosomal RNA targeted fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide
probes be used for the rapid detection and identification of pathogens, without cultivation
and biotyping (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Kempf & Volkhard, 2000,
level 9).
3.
MANAGEMENT
With respect to management, apart from antibiotic administration, supportive strategies
are essential to optimize outcome.
3.1
Community Acquired Bacterial Sepsis in Previously Healthy Children
(i)
Sepsis with no obvious source or with respiratory or urinary tract infection, or
central nervous system involvement
Though the commonly used antibiotics are cloxacillin/penicillin and a third
generation cephalosporin/gentamycin, no evidence could be obtained related to their
use (Grade C).
(ii)
Sepsis with genito-urinary or gastrointestinal tract involvement
The commonly used antibiotics are a third generation cephalosporin or gentamycin
with metronidazole for intra-abdominal infections, but again no evidence could be
obtained related to their use (Grade C).
3.2
Nosocomial Sepsis
There are multiple causative agents that cause nosocomial sepsis in children. It is
therefore recommended that the use of antibiotics be dependent on the causative agents.
3.3
Adjuvant therapy
It has been found that Polyclonal Intravenous Immunoglobulin significantly reduces
mortality and can be used as adjuvant treatment for sepsis and septic shock, but the
number of patients involved in this study was small ( Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003,
level 1, Alejandria et al, 2001, level 1).

NEONATAL SEPSIS
1.
INTRODUCTION
Neonates, especially premature babies, are predisposed to infection as they are deficient
in host defences and are at risk of acquiring infections from mothers during the perinatal
period (Anwer et al, 2000, level 8). In order to rationalise the use of antibiotics,
continuous surveillance is recommended with emphasis on primary prevention and
prevention of cross infection (Musoke, 1997, level 9).
2.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Early clinical presentation of sepsis in newborn includes hypothermia, hyperthermia,
poor feeding, poor weight gain, lethargy, hypotonia, pallor, mottled skin, irritability,
jaundice, vomiting, ileus, pseudoparalysis, apnea, tachypnoea, cardiovascular signs,
hemorrhagic diasthesis and sclerema. Late signs are usually specific to a single organ
system. Septicemic shock and death often occur within 12 hours of the first sign of illness
(Anwer et al, 2000, level 8).
3.
DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Early diagnosis and therapy initiated on the basis of clinical suspicion is important.
Criteria for treatment could be defined by limited predictors or parameters as follows:
1. Maternal fever, chorioamniotis, initial neonatal examination and absolute count.
(Escobar, Li & Armstrong , 2000, level 5)
2. Abnormal immature to total neutrophil ratio (I: T), followed by an abnormal
immature to mature neutrophil (I: M) ratio, thrombocytopenia (Ghosh, Mittal &
Jaganathan, 2001, level 9).
While blood culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of sepsis (Aggarwal et al, 2001,
level 9), rapid identification systems help in the early identification of neonatal
bacteraemia (within 24- 30 hours) (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Pauli et al,
1999, level 9).
Other investigations found to be useful are:
♦ C-reactive protein (CRP) (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Dollner,
Vatten & Austgulen , 2001, level 9; Icagasloglu et al, 2002).
♦ Neutrophil CD64 expression - the addition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) or CRP further
enhances the sensitivity and negative predictivity (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003,
level 1; Ng, 2002, level 9)
♦ Interleukins (IL) (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Santana et al, 2001,
level 7; Martin, Olander & Norman 2001, level 9; Krueger et al, 2001, level 7;
Gonzalez et al, 2003 level 8; Icagasloglu et al, 2002, level 9) - diagnostic accuracy is
improved by combining CRP and IL-6 (Dollner, Vatten & Austgulen, 2001, level 9).
4.
MANAGEMENT
The appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of infections in neonates would vary from
centre to centre as would the organisms causing the various infections (Chang Chien et al,
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
2000, level 9). Hence, local data on aetiology of sepsis and the sensitivity of the
organisms need to be reviewed.
Group B streptococcus was the major pathogen of early onset septicemia (Ministry of
Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Berger et al, 1998, level 9; Luck et al, 2003, level 9;
Mehr et al, 2002, level 9; Yurdakok, 1998, Ronnestad et al, 1998, level 9). Penicillin is
the drug of choice for group B Streptococcus infections (Ministry of Health Malaysia,
2003, level 1; Lin et al, 2000, level 9;Aitmhand & Moustaoui, 2000, level 9). Other
organisms implicated in early onset sepsis are Enterobactericaea and Listeria, (Yurdakok,,
1998), E. coli (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level ; Kuruvilla et al 1998, level 9;
Ronnestad et al 1998, level 9), Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), anaerobic
bacteria(Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Ronnestad et al, 1998, level 9),
Klebsiella species, Enterococcus (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Anwer et al,
2000, level 8).
Empiric therapy for neonates who develop sepsis beyond the first day of life must cover
Gram positive organisms like Staph. aureus (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;
Karunasekara & Pathirana, 1999, level 8; Ronnestad et al 1998, level 9; Yurdakok, 1998;
Anwer et al, 2000, level 8), Coagulase negative staphylococcus (Ministry of Health
Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Ho, 2001, level 9; Berger et al, 1998, level 9; Mehr et al, 2002,
level 9); S. epidermidis (Anwer et al, 2000, level 8) For Staphylococcus, penicillinase
resistant penicillin e.g. Oxacillin, Nafcillin and Methicillin and for resistant strains of
Staphylococcus, Vancomycin is recommended (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level
1;Yurdakok, 1998, Ronnestad et al, 1998, level 9). Enterococci must also be covered
(Yurdakok, 1998, Kuruvillla et al, 1998), with Ampicillin and Gentamicin for sensitive
strains and Vancomycin for Gentamicin resistant strains (Ministry of Health Malaysia,
2003, level 1; Bhat, Paul & Bhat, 1997, level 9; Yurdakok, 1998).
Therapy must also cover Gram negative organisms like Klebsiella (Karunasekara &
Buescher, 1999, Kuruvillla et al, 1998, Ho, 2001), using Imipenem which is a good drug
for neonatal Klebsiella pneumonia (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Oral,
Akisu & Kultursay 1998, level 9; Roilides & Kyriakides, 2000, level 9), and Ciprofloxcin
as an alternative in multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (Ministry of Health
Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Khaneja & Naprawa, 1999, level 9; Roilides & Kyriakides, 2000,
level 9). Other combinations include Cefotaxime or Ceftazidime and Ampicillin
(Akindele & Rotilu 1997, level 9), Ciprofloxacillin and Gentamicin (Ministry of Health
Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Khaneja & Naprawa, 1999, level 9), aminoglycoside and a third
generation cephalosporin such as Cefotaxime (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level
1,), and Imipenem or Ciprofloxacin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Roilides
& Kyriakides, 2000, level 9).
For Pseudomonas. sp. (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Karlowicz, Buescher
& Surlear, 2000, level 5; Yurdakok, 1998) especially in fulminant sepsis, treatment with
Piperacillin and Azlocillin, Cefoperazone and Ceftazidime were the most active against
Pseudomonas (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Yurdakok, 1998). Treatment
for E. coli is also important (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Ronnestad et al,
1998, level 9).
Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions
There has generally been an increase in the resistance of gram-negative bacteria to
Cephalosporins and Gentamicin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Joshi et al
2000, level 9). Ciprofloxacillin was found to be useful for these resistant bacteria
(Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Joshi et al 2000, level 8; Van den Vever &
Vers teegh, 1998, level 8; Yurdakok, 1998)
Imipenam cilastin is effective in premature babies and newborns with serious nosocomial
infections even after failure of other broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ministry of Health
Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Boswald, Dobig & Kandler , 1999, level 9)
In a local study, the incidence of nososcomial sepsis was 32.6% of whom 43.3% died,
and 80% of the babies had gram negative organisms (Halder et al, 1999, level 9)
Fungal:
For treatment of Candida species (Ronnestad et al, 1998, level 9), amphotericin has been
found to be effective in babies at risk for fungal infections and blood culture confirmed
sepsis (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Benjamin, Ross & McKinney, 2000,
level 5, Rowen & Tate, 1998). Liposomal Amphotericin B has also been found to be
effective and safe for the treatment of fungal infections (Ministry of Health Malaysia,
2003, level 1; Scarcella & Pasquariello, 1998, level 9; Weitkamp & Poets, 1998, level 9).
5.
RECOMMENDATIONS
i.
For early onset sepsis, penicillin or ampicillin and gentamicin are
recommended [Grade C]
