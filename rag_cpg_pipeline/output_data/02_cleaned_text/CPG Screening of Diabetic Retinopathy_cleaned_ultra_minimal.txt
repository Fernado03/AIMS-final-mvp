SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES
GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT
The Development Group for these Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) was from
the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Higher Education. They consisted
of ophthalmologists, a paediatrician, an obstetrician & gynaecologist, a public
health physician, a family medicine specialist, an optometrist, an assistant
medical officer and a nursing sister. There was active involvement of the Review
Committee during the process of development of these guidelines.
Literature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: Guidelines
International Network (G-I-N); Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD);
PubMed; Ovid Medline, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews,
EBM Reviews - Health Technology Assessment, Journals full text via OVID search
engine (refer to Appendix 1 for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists
of all retrieved articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Experts in the
field were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches were conducted
between September 2009 and January 2011. Future CPG updates will consider
evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can
be obtained upon request from the CPG Seretariat.
Reference was also made to other guidelines on Diabetic Retinopathy such as
The American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern Diabetic
Retinopathy (2008) and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
Australia Guidelines for the Management of Diabetic Retinopathy (2008). These
CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and
Evaluation (AGREE) prior to them being used as references.
The clinical questions were developed under three major subtopics and members
of the Development Group were assigned individual questions within these
subtopics (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The group members met
a total of 16 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature
retrieved was appraised by at least two members and presented in the form
of evidence tables and discussed during Development Group meetings. All
statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the
Development Group and Review Committee. Where evidence was insufficient,
the recommendations were made by consensus of both groups. These CPG are
based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical
trials, with local practices taken into consideration.
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
The articles were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive Services Task Force
Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of recommendation in these guidelines
was modified from grades of recommendation of the Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network (SIGN).
The draft guidelines were posted on the MOH Malaysia official website for
comment and feedback. It had also been presented to the Technical Advisory
Committee for CPG and the HTA-CPG Council, MOH Malaysia for review and
approval.
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
OBJECTIVE
The objective of these CPG is to provide evidence-based recommendations in the
screening of Diabetic Retinopathy. This would prevent or reduce the risk of visual
loss, thereby maintaining or improving vision-related quality of life.

ALGORITHM FOR SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY TO PREVENT BLINDNESS
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
1.0 INTRODUCTION
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is an important public health concern. Globally there
is a rising trend in the prevalence of DM due to many factors such as aging,
urbanisation and increasing prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity. The
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) predicts that the prevalence of DM in
South East Asia will increase by two folds by the year 2025.1, level III The World Health
Organization (WHO) has estimated that in the year 2030, Malaysia would have a
total of 2.48 million people with DM.2, level III In Malaysia, the first National Health
and Morbidity Survey I (NHMS I) conducted in 1986 reported a DM prevalence
of 6.3%. This had risen to 8.3% in the NHMS II 1996 report. In the latest NHMS
III 2006 report, the overall prevalence of DM was 11.6% and 14.9% in those
aged above 18 and 30 years respectively. NHMS I and II involved subjects aged
above 30 years while NHMS III was conducted among subjects above 18 years of
age.3, level III
DM is a complex disease with end organ complications. However, good control
of DM will prevent the onset or retard progression of the various complications
including diabetic retinopathy (DR). In Malaysia, diabetic eye disease is the
commonest cause of visual loss among adults of working age. Prevalence of
DR is closely linked to the duration of DM. At diagnosis, less than 5% will have
retinopathy while the prevalence rises to 40 - 50% after 10 years. Almost all
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and more than 60% patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have some degree of retinopathy after 20 years
of the disease.2, level III Screening and early treatment can prevent substantial visual
loss in many cases. Late presentation continues to be a major challenge of
prevention and alleviation of blindness.
DM prevalence in Malaysia has dramatically risen to almost twice in the
magnitude over the last decade. In view of this, efforts to control this chronic
disease and early detection of complications such as DR should be intensified.
This is important as DR is asymptomatic in its early stage when it is most easily
amenable to treatment.
Therefore, a DR screening programme must be comprehensive, covering all
individuals with DM in Malaysia.
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
2. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND DIABETIC
RETINOPATHY
WHO estimates that the global prevalence of DM will increase from 2.8% to 4.4%
from the year 2000 to 2030.4, level III Due to its chronicity, severity of complication
and complexity of management, DM is a costly disease both for the affected
individuals and the health sector as a whole.
DR is the leading cause of blindness and visual disability in adults of economically
developed societies in the Western Pacific Region.1, level III Its prevalence is closely
linked to the duration of DM and varies among nations and ethnicity.5, level III
2.1 Prevalence and Incidence of Diabetes Mellitus
2.1.1 Adults
The prevalence of DM among those aged more than 30 years in Malaysia has
increased alarmingly from 6.3% (1986) to 8.3% (1996) and 14.9% in 2006.
There was also an increasing trend in the prevalence with age (2.0% among
those aged 18 - 19 years to 20.8 - 26.2% among aged 50 - 64 years). Based
on ethnicity, Indians have the highest prevalence followed by Malays and
Chinese.3, level III Among those with DM for more than 15 years, approximately 2%
became blind and 10% developed severe visual handicap.1, level III
It has been recommended that all DM patients should have at least a yearly
eye examination.6, level III However, the NHMS III 2006 reported that only 45% of
patients with known DM ever had an eye examination.3, level III
2.1.2 Children and Adolescents
T1DM accounts for over 90% of childhood and adolescent diabetes in most
western countries.7, level III The incidence of T1DM is on the increasing trend
worldwide. The average annual increase is 4% in Asia, 3.2% in Europe and 5.3 %
in North America.8, level III In the Asian population, T2DM occurs at a much greater
prevalence ranging between 50% and 90%.9, level III
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
According to the Diabetes in Children and Adolescents Registry from April 2006
to June 2007, T1DM (69.2%) was more common than T2DM (17.5%).10, level III
However there is no available data on the prevalence of DM in children and
adolescents in Malaysia.
2.2 Prevalence and Incidence of Diabetic Retinopathy
DR is a leading complication of DM. The prevalence of DR worldwide ranges from
6.8 to 44.4% in patients with diabetes mellitus.11 - 15, level III
In Malaysia, the prevalence of DR from the 2007 Diabetic Eye Registry was
36.8%16, level III which was comparable to the prevalence of 35% found in the
Singapore Malay Eye Study 2006.5, level III Other unpublished local data obtained
from primary care screening centres showed a prevalence ranging between
12.3% and 16.9%.17 - 18, level III
In a study conducted in New South Wales, Australia, the prevalence of early DR
in children less than 11 years was 8% as compared to 25% of adolescents older
than 11 years.19, level II-2 However, there is no retrievable data on the prevalence of
DR in children and adolescents in Malaysia.
2.3 Prevalence of Blindness and Sight Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy
The prevalence of sight threatening DR ranges from 4.0 to 22.2%.5, level III;
20 - 21, level III; 22, level II-2; 23 - 24, level III In Malaysia, the National Eye Database (NED) 2007
and 2008 reported that the proportion of patients with sight threatening DR was
15.6% and 11.5% respectively. The proportion of patients with blindness was
9.0%.16, level III
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
3. RISK FACTORS
There are many risk factors for DR. The duration of DM is significantly associated
with the development and severity of DR with odds ratio (OR) ranging from 1.07
to 8.62.5, level III; 20 - 21, level III; 23, level III, 25
Significant systemic risk factors include hypertension and high HbA1c, systolic
blood pressure (SBP), pulse pressure, serum lipoprotein level and body mass
index (BMI).5, level III; 20 - 21, level III; 22, level II-2; 23 - 24, level III; 25; 26, level III Other documented risk
factors include renal disease/nephropathy, genetic factors, high waist-hipratio (abdominal obesity), upper socioeconomic status, urban residence,
higher plasma total homocysteine level, male gender, insulin treatment
and pregnancy.20, level III; 23 - 24, level III ; 25; 27, level III
The risk factors for sight threatening DR are chronic kidney disease (OR=4.45,
95% CI 2.18 to 9.07), previous stroke (OR=3.74, 95% CI 1.24 to 11.26),
cardiovascular disease (OR=2.23, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.62),5, level III duration of DM
(OR=1.38, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.87)21, level III and hypercholesterolemia.25
Recommendation
•
Screening for diabetic retinopathy should be done in all patients with
diabetes mellitus. (Grade C)
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
4. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY GRADING
To improve communication worldwide between ophthalmologists and primary
healthcare providers in managing patients with DM, an international clinical
disease severity scale was developed for DR and Diabetic Macula Oedema
(DME) (refer to Table 1). This scale is based on the Early Treatment for Diabetic
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Classification of DR and on the data collected in
clinical trials and epidemiologic studies of DR.

Examples of fundus appearance according to DR Stages are shown in Appendix 3.
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
5. ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
A variety of screening modalities are available in detecting and classifying DR.
Ophthalmoscopy is the most commonly used technique to screen for DR.
However, non-mydriatic digital fundus photography is now being widely used.
There is a wide variation in the sensitivities and specificities of different screening
modalities performed by different screeners.
5.1 Screening Tools
The instruments that can be used for screening are:
•
Direct ophthalmoscope
•
PAN-ophthalmoscope
•
Binocular indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO)
•
Slit lamp biomicroscope
•
Mydriatic fundus camera
•
Non-mydriatic fundus camera
5.1.1 Sensitivity and Specificity of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Tools
The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that DR
screening modalities should have a sensitivity of at least 80%, a specificity of at
least 95% and a technical failure rate of no greater than 5%.28
Table 2 describes the diagnostic accuracy of different screening tools. Nonmydriatic fundus camera has high sensitivity and specificity. It eliminates the
need for pupillary dilatation, promoting compliance, efficiency and safety. The
findings by Aptel F et al showed that at least one field photo assessment was
sufficient to detect DR. However, the Training Module for DR Screening in Malaysia
recommends two fields photo assessment.29, level III

5.1.2 Agreement between Non-mydriatic Fundus Camera versus
Ophthalmoscope and Mydriatic Fundus Camera
As a screening tool, non-mydriatic fundus camera has good inter-rater reliability with
ophthalmoscope (κ=0.90)31, level II-2 and mydriatic fundus camera (κ=0.80).32, level I
Recommendation
•
Non-mydriatic fundus camera should be used as a screening tool for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) when possible. (Grade A)
o Two fields fundus photo assessment should be done. (Grade C)
•
When there is no access to fundus camera, ophthalmoscope should be
used for screening of DR. (Grade C)
5.2 Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Grading
Automated grading of DR is a growing research field aimed at decreasing
the burden of grading. Various individual softwares have been
developed.33 - 34, level II-2; 35 - 36, level III However, further evaluation and validation is
required for local use.
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
5.3 Pupillary Dilatation
Non-mydriatic fundus photography generally does not require pupil dilatation if
performed in an adequately darkened room. However, in cases of small pupil and
ungradable photos, pupillary dilatation can increase the sensitivity of screening
by over 50%. Those performing DR screening should be aware of the possibility
of inducing acute angle closure glaucoma in high risk individuals (history of
glaucoma and shallow anterior chamber). The use of tropicamide 1% alone has
not been reported to cause this complication.37, level III
Those intending to use tropicamide 1% should be aware of the possible side effects.
Recommendation
•
Tropicamide 1% should be used for pupillary dilatation in selected cases
by trained personnel. (Grade C)
5.4. Examination and Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy by Healthcare
Professionals
The screening and grading of DR can be performed with high accuracy by:38 - 42, level III
•
Doctors (family medicine specialists, general practitioners and medical
officers)
•
Optometrists
•
Assistant medical officers and nurses
All healthcare personnel need proper training before they can be privileged for
DR screening so as to increase the interpretation and grading accuracy. Studies
have shown that the sensitivity and specificity of interpretation increased after
training.38 - 39, level III; 41, level III Jackson CL et al reported that brief training intervention
had increased the accuracy of interpretation from 24% to 94%.41, level III In
another study, trained primary care clinicians showed appropriate referral to the
ophthalmologist with a sensitivity of 89.8% and a specificity of 93%.38, level III
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
Retinal screeners and graders require specific training, accreditation and regular
performance assessment. Training module should include:
• Clinical knowledge and skills
• Imaging and computer skills
• Operational issues
• Fundus grading
A Training Steering Group has been established by the Ministry of Health (MOH)
Malaysia. This group has produced a training manual and developed a training
curriculum.29 The MOH has accredited the training curriculum and training
materials. Training should be adapted to the local setting to enable the trainees to
handle available and relevant equipments.
Recommendation
• All diabetic retinopathy (DR) screeners must undergo appropriate and
standardised training as per DR screening training module. (Grade C)
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
6. EXAMINATION SCHEDULE
Early detection of sight threatening retinopathy by regular examination is the
key to reduce visual loss and blindness from DR. Due to the sight threatening
potential of DR and the availability of methods to slow down the rate of disease
progression, a proper screening at an appropriate time is recommended.25
6.1 Timing of First Screening
The initial fundus examination for DR varies according to the types of DM:
•
Adults T1DM
Adults with T1DM should have their first screening within three to five
years after the initial diagnosis.43; 44, level III
•
Adults T2DM
The time of onset of T2DM is often difficult to determine and may
precede the diagnosis by a number of years. Therefore, patients should
have their first fundus examination at the time of diagnosis.43; 44, level III
•
Pregnant Women with Pre-existing DM
DR can worsen during pregnancy because of changes in metabolic
status. Individuals with DM planning for pregnancy should have their
eyes examined prior to conception and counselled on the risk of
development and progression of DR.25; 43
• Gestational DM (GDM)
GDM is an abnormal glucose intolerance first detected during pregnancy.
In general, DR screening is not required for GDM.25; 43 However, if GDM
is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy, screening should be as
per pre-existing DM.
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
• Children and Adolescents
Incidence of DR in young children is negligibly small and therefore children
younger than 9 years old do not require screening for DR.45, level III International
Society for Paediatric & Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) Clinical Practice
Consensus Guidelines 2009 recommends timing of first screening as
follows:46, level III
a) T1DM:
•
At age 9 years with 5 years of diabetes duration
•
At age 11 years with 2 years of diabetes duration
b) T2DM:
• At the time of diagnosis
Recommendation
•
First screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) should be done at:
o Adults type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) - up to 3 years after diagnosis
o Adults type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) - at time of diagnosis
o Pregnant women with
i.
Pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) - prior to planned pregnancy
ii.
Gestational DM (GDM) diagnosed in the first trimester
- at the time of diagnosis. Otherwise not required.
o Children T1DM
i. At age 9 years with 5 years of DM duration
ii. At age 11 years with 2 years of DM duration
o Children T2DM - at time of diagnosis (Grade C)
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
6.2 Follow-up Examination Schedule
Individuals with DM should be screened at least every two years. High risk
individuals (longer duration of diabetes or poor control of blood sugar, blood
pressure or serum lipid) should be examined at least annually.25
The examination should include:
•
Visual acuity assessment (Snellen chart and equivalent)
•
Fundus photography or dilated fundus examination
Individuals with any signs of NPDR should be examined at 6 - 12 monthly
intervals. Earlier follow-up may be required in: 43; 44, level III
•
High risk groups
•
Presence of renal complications
•
progression of DR
The recommended intervals for eye examination for patients with DM are provided
in Table 3.

6.3 Referral Criteria to Ophthalmologist
The ultimate aim for screening of DR is to detect sight threatening DR and to
ensure timely treatment in order to prevent vision loss. Appropriate referral to the
ophthalmologist should be done.
Criteria for referral are:28
•
Any level of Diabetic Maculopathy
•
Severe NPDR
•
Any PDR
•
Unexplained visual loss
•
If screening examination cannot be performed including ungradable
fundus photo
The urgency of referral is as shown in Table 4.
Table 4: Criteria for Urgent Referral
Urgency of referral
Ocular features
Emergency (same day referral)
•
Sudden severe visual loss
•
Symptoms or signs of acute retinal
detachment
Within 1 week
•
Presence of retinal new vessels
•
Preretinal haemorrhage
•
Vitreous haemorrhage
•
Rubeosis iridis
Within 4 weeks
•
Unexplained drop in visual acuity
•
Any form of maculopathy
•
Severe NPDR
•
Worsening retinopathy

and early management London: NICE; 2002
Recommendation
•
Examination schedule and urgency of referral to an ophthalmologist
should be based on the grade and severity of diabetic retinopathy as well
as the presence of risk factors. (Grade C)
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
7.0 TREATMENT FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
7.1 Current Treatment Modalities
Early detection of DR is important as it is reversible. There are many treatment
modalities available (refer to Table 5). Laser photocoagulation remains the
standard practice for treating DR. Stages of DR which require treatment includes
severe NPDR, PDR, ADED and DME.
Table 5: Summary of Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy
Stage of DR
Mode of Treatment
DME
• Laser - focal/ grid
• Intraocular steroids*
• Intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)*
Severe NPDR
• Laser - scattered pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP)
PDR
• Laser - PRP
ADED
• Intraocular steroids
• Intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
• Vitrectomy
*For refractory DME
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
7.2 Modifiable Risk Factors in Reducing Progression of Diabetiic Retinopathy
The mainstay of current treatment involves risk factor modification by controlling
blood glucose, blood pressure and serum lipids as shown in Table 6. Potential
alternative therapeutic approaches that directly target diabetic microvascular
complications include:25; 47
•
antiplatelet agents
•
advanced glycation end (AGE) product inhibitors
•
aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs)
•
protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors
•
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
•
fenofibrate

SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
8.0 IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES
This chapter provides advice on the resource implications associated with implementing
the key recommendations and advice on proposed clinical audit indicators for quality
management to aid implementation.
Implementation of these CPG is an essential part of clinical governance. It should
cater to the local individual hospitals, health clinics and community based on both
economic and non-economic considerations. Mechanisms should be in place to
review the existing healthcare system as compared to the CPG recommendations.
Any differences should be assessed and addressed appropriately.
Important issues that should be considered when implementing these CPG in
Malaysia are:-
•
establishment of a screening programme
•
proper DR database
•
adequate training and privileging of screeners and graders
•
availability of screening tools
•
co-ordinated referral system & availability of resources for necessary treatment
8.1 Existing Facilitators and Barriers in Applying Recommendations
The implementation of the CPG will be facilitated by the existing DR Screening
Training Module of the MOH Malaysia. The module has been established since
2008 and involves the training of family medicine specialists, medical officers,
optometrists, assistant medical officers and nurses. However, the Development
Group will ensure that the contents of this training module will be in tandem with
the recommendations in the CPG.
There are three barriers in applying recommendations of the CPG in the local context:
i. Patient factors
•
Lack of awareness of the possible complications of DM to the eye as DR
may remain asymptomatic
•
Poor access to eye care services
•
Different cultural beliefs
ii. Healthcare professional factors
•
Limited knowledge and/or poor attitude
•
Limited resources
•
High turnover of trained screeners and graders
•
Lack of utilisation of screening tools
SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
iii. Health services factors
•
Lack of linkages between services and providers
•
Lack of recalls or reminders for defaulters
•
Long waiting list for first screening and referral to see ophthalmologist
•
Lack of optimisation of fundus cameras
With the availability of these national evidence-based CPG, the current
nation-wide screening programme will be strengthened to prevent blindness
among those with DM.
8.2 Potential Resource Implications in Applying Recommendations
In implementing the CPG, the Development Group recommends strengthening of
the existing training module on DR screening. Financial allocation is proposed to
individual hospitals, health clinics and communities to achieve adequate access
to eye screening.
In view of the low percentage of DM patients screened for DR annually,3, level III the
development group proposes the following clinical audit indicators for quality
management as part of ensuring the implementation of recommendations in the
CPG:-
• Percentage of T2DM
patients screened for
DR for the first time
=
Number of T2DM patients screened
for DR for the first time within a year
x 100%
Total number of newly registered
T2DM patients within the same year
• Percentage of
ungradable
fundus photo
=
Number of patients with ungradable
fundus photo within a year
x 100%
Total number of patients’ fundus
photos taken within the same year
• Percentage of diabetics
screened with
sight threatening DR
=
Number of diabetics screened with
sight threatening DR within a year
x 100%
Total number of diabetics screened for
DR within the same year
