The guideline should not override the responsibility of\nthe practitioners to make decision appropriate to the circumstances of\nthe individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and\ntheir families or guardians, taking into account the management options\navailable locally. UPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2024 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2028) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When\nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

FORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION\n\u2022 In line with the new development in CPG methodology, the\nCPG Unit of MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations,\nAssessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) in its\nwork process. The quality of body of evidence and related effect\nsize are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG DG. \u2022 Recommendations are formulated based on certainty of\nevidence and the wording used denotes the strength of\nrecommendations. This takes into account:\n\uf0a1 quality and level of the evidence\n\uf0a1 balance of benefits and harms of the options\n\uf0a1 patient\u2019s preference and values\n\uf0a1 resource implications\n\uf0a1 relevancy and applicability to the local target population\n\u2022 The more criteria being fulfilled, the more certain is the evidence\nleading to strong recommendations using the word \u201cshould\u201d\nbeing considered. Otherwise, weak recommendations use the\nword \u201cmay\u201d in proposing an action to be made. \u2022 In the CPG, a yellow box highlights important message(s) in\nthe management while a blue box contains evidence-based\nrecommendation(s) for the particular condition.

Management of Erectile Dysfunction\nii\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe following recommendations are highlighted by the CPG DG as the\nkey recommendations that answer the main questions addressed in the\nCPG and should be prioritised for implementation. DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT\n\u2022 A comprehensive medical, psychosocial and sexual history should\nbe taken in every patient presenting with erectile dysfunction (ED). \u2022 A validated questionnaire related to ED should be used to assess\nall sexual function domains (e.g. International Index of Erectile\nFunction). \u2022 A focused physical examination in the initial assessment of men\nwith ED should be done to identify underlying medical conditions\nand co-morbid genital disorders that may be associated with ED. \u2022 Routine laboratory tests should be performed to identify modi\ufb01able\nrisk factors of ED. \u2022 Patients with ED should have cardiac risk assessment and vice\nversa. TREATMENT\n\u2022 All patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) should be advised on\nlifestyle and risk factor modi\ufb01cations. \u2022 Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor should be offered to all patients with\nED unless contraindicated. \u2022 Mechanical devices (e.g. using vacuum erection device or\nshockwave therapy) may be offered in ED. Low-intensity\nextracorporeal shockwave therapy should be performed by\nurologists for mild to moderate ED. \u2022 Penile prothesis may be offered to patients with ED who have\nfailed other interventions. \u2022 An integrated and collaborative approach with psychological\ninterventions should be considered in the treatment of ED. Management of Erectile Dysfunction\niii\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the DG for this CPG were from the Ministry of Health\n(MoH), the Ministry of Higher Education and the private sector. There\nwas active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC)\nduring the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and others\ne.g. PubMed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria are all adults at risk and with erectile dysfunction\n(ED) regardless of study design. The \ufb01rst search was limited to\nliterature published in the last 15 years (2007 until 2022) for all clinical\nquestions, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of\nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify\nrelevant studies. Experts in the \ufb01eld were also contacted for studies\nrelated to the issues addressed. All searches were conducted from 2\nto 17 August 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 9 January 2024 to be included. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from\nthe CPG Secretariat.", "chunk_order": 2}

References were also made to other guidelines on ED as listed below:\n\u2022 American Urological Association (AUA) - Erectile Dysfunction: AUA\nGuideline (2018)\n\u2022 European Association of Urology (EAU) - EAU Guidelines on\nSexual and Reproductive Health (2023)\nA total of 12 main clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG\nmembers met 21 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using\nthe Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insuf\ufb01cient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion\nare resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely on the \ufb01ndings\nof systematic reviews/meta-analyses and clinical trials, with local\npractices taken into consideration. Management of Erectile Dysfunction\niv\nThe literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2015) while the\ngrading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE\nas much as possible (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the\nCPG followed strictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II. Upon completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It\nwas also posted on the MoH Malaysia of\ufb01cial website for feedback from\nany interested parties. The draft was \ufb01nally presented to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology Assessment\n(HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent and multifaceted medical\ncondition characterised by the persistent inability to achieve or\nmaintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. As a\nwidespread health concern, ED substantially impacts the quality of life\nof affected individuals and their partners, leading to emotional distress,\nstrained relationships and diminished overall well-being.1, level III\nED can manifest in various forms which can be due to organic,\npsychogenic and mixed aetiologies.2 Organic ED may result\nfrom vascular, neurogenic, hormonal or anatomical factors, while\npsychogenic ED is often associated with psychosocial issues. Mixed\nED involves a combination of both organic and psychogenic factors,\nmaking a comprehensive understanding of the condition crucial for\neffective management. The pathophysiology of ED is complex, involving intricate interplay\nbetween vascular, neurologic, hormonal and psychological factors. Vascular insufficiency, endothelial dysfunction and altered smooth\nmuscle tone are common contributors. Understanding these\nmechanisms is essential for tailoring therapeutic interventions to the\nspecific needs of the patient. In 1995, approximately 150 million men worldwide were estimated to be\naffected by ED and this is likely to double by 2025.3, level III Throughout\nAsia, there is variation in the prevalence rate of ED ranging between\n2.0% and 81.8%.4, level III A local study at five government primary care\nclinics in Petaling District showed that the prevalence of ED for males\naged 40 to 79 years old was 69.5%.", "chunk_order": 6}

It increased with age from 49.7%\nof men in their 40s to 66.5%, 92.8% and 93.9% of men in their 50s, 60s\nand 70s respectively.5, level III A recent study based on National Health\nand Morbidity Survey 2019 data revealed a prevalence of moderate\nto severe ED in men aged \u226518 years at 31.6% (95% CI 28.8 to\n34.6).6, level III\nThe burden of ED extends beyond its physical manifestations, impacting\nthe mental and emotional well-being of individuals. It is associated with\nco- morbidities e.g. diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular diseases\n(CVDs) and depression. Moreover, ED is known to be an early marker\nof systemic vascular dysfunction, emphasising the importance of timely\ndiagnosis and intervention.2\nClinical practices for the diagnosis and treatment of ED can vary\nsignificantly, reflecting differences in healthcare systems, cultural\nperceptions and access to resources. Recognising and addressing\nthese variations is crucial to ensure equitable and effective care for the\naffected individuals. Management of Erectile Dysfunction\nIn conclusion, this CPG on Management of ED endeavours to provide\na systematic and culturally sensitive approach to the diagnosis and\ntreatment of ED. It is hoped that this CPG can help in optimising\nresource utilisation by providing evidence-based recommendations\nfor efficient and safe management of ED. Eventually, this will lead to\nstandardised care, improved patient outcomes and reduced the burden\nof ED on affected individuals, their partners and the healthcare system. Management of Erectile Dysfunction\n2. RISK FACTORS\nThere are various risk factors associated with ED e.g. age, lifestyle\nbehaviours, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, psychological and\nhormonal risks. A person may have more than one risk factor at a time. 2.1\nAge\nIn a local study on moderate to severe ED, all age groups of patients\nabove 18 years old and sexually active were substantially affected by\nthe condition.

There are two methods\nof administration. The first method is the Medicated Urethral System\nfor Erection (MUSE) where a pellet of alprostadil is inserted into the\nurethra. A recent method uses topical cream that can be applied into\nthe urethra meatus or onto the glans penis. In a systematic review, five RCTs showed significant improvement in\nerection which was sufficient for intercourse in MUSE compared with\nplacebo. However, MUSE was shown to be inferior to ICIs.

Generally, the affected patients tend to develop ED\nat a younger age and may have a history of preceding trauma. Penile\nrevascularisation is usually done in a very specialised centre outside\nof Malaysia. Management of Erectile Dysfunction\n\u2022\nArterial insufficiency\nAI occurs when there is inadequate arterial blood to the penis at the time\nof erection and may result if the artery cannot dilate appropriately after\nneurochemical signalling or if the upstream vascular flow is restricted. Consensus guidelines by the International Consultation on Sexual\nMedicine (ICSM) recommend that men with ED who satisfy the criteria\nof the index patient (<55 years with recently acquired ED from focal\narterial occlusive disease in the absence of other risk factors e.g. smoking, DM) can be considered for penile revascularisation procedures\n(microsurgery or endovascular intervention). However, current data do\nnot support one procedure over another in terms of effectiveness.78\nShort- and long-term complications of microsurgery include wound\ninfection (2.8%), urinary tract infection (2.6%), inguinal hernias (2.8%),\nsepsis (3.5%), wound haematoma (7.8 - 25%), loss of penile length\n(28%), decreased penile sensitivity (24.7%) and glans hyperaemia\n(4 - 21%).78\nPotential complications of endovascular treatment (balloon angioplasty\nwith or without stent insertion) include vascular injury, puncture site\naneurysm, infection, contrast-induced nephropathy. ICSM consensus\nguidelines reports NS AEs.78\n\u2022\nVeno-occlusive disease\nVOD occurs when an erection cannot be achieved or maintained despite\nan adequate arterial supply. It is most likely results from endothelial and\nsmooth muscle dysfunction leading to inadequate sinusoidal expansion\nand insufficient closure of emissary veins. Both consensus guidelines of ICSM and EAU Guidelines 2023 do not\nrecommend venous surgery or embolisation for VOD.2; 78\n\u2022 Vascular ED should be suspected in patients with ED at a younger\nage with the absence of other risk factors. b) Penile prosthesis\nIn Malaysia, PP is usually used when other treatment modalities have\nfailed.

Recommendation 5\n\u2022 Penile prothesis may be offered to patients with erectile dysfunction\nwho have failed other interventions. 4.5\nPsychological Intervention\nPsychosocial intervention plays a vital role in ED treatment because\nboth psychological and social factors predispose and perpetuate\nerectile problems. It is recommended to involve the partner in this\nmanagement of ED as it may help to identify sexual difficulties among the\npartners.18, level III; 55, level III The main components of psychosocial\ntreatment of ED include psychoeducation, cognitive and behavioural\ntechniques, aimed at reducing anxiety, challenging dysfunctional\nbeliefs, increasing sexual stimulation, disrupting sexual avoidance and,\nincreasing intimacy and communication skills in a relational context.

It is important to note that these are specific follow-up plans and will\nvary based on the patient\u2019s individual circumstances and response\nto treatment. Regular communication and collaboration between the\nprimary care physician and the urologist, if involved, are key components\nof effective care for individuals with ED. Management of Erectile Dysfunction\n7. REFERRAL\nReferring a patient with ED to a urologist or other relevant specialist is\ntypically considered when/at:\n\u2022 Primary care evaluation: The primary care physician has assessed\nthe patient, taken a detailed medical history and performed a\nphysical examination. If the underlying cause of ED is not evident\nor if there are concerns about specific urological issues, a referral\nmay be appropriate. \u2022 Treatment failure or complexity: If initial treatments, e.g. lifestyle\nchanges, oral medications (like PDE5i) or other conservative\nmeasures, do not yield satisfactory results or if a case is complex\nand may require specialised interventions (e.g. penile injections,\nVEDs or surgical options), a urologist may be consulted. \u2022 Underlying medical conditions: Presence of co-morbidities that\nmight contribute to or exacerbate ED e.g. diabetes mellitus,\nCVD, or hormonal disorders, consultation with a urologist and/or\nendocrinologist/cardiologist may be warranted. \u2022 Psychological factors: If psychological factors are suspected to\nbe a significant contributor to the ED, collaboration with a mental\nhealth professional may be necessary.

Vacuum erection devices: a review. World J Urol. 1990;8:114-117. \u2022\nThe equipment consists of a\nvacuum chamber, a vacuum\npump, and a constricting ring or\nband. \u2022\nThe pump can be operated\nmanually as shown, but usually\nbattery-operated for easy use. \u2022\nAn elastic band is used to\nconstrict the base of the penis\nto maintain erection after it is\nachieved. \u2022\nBefore the device is used, the\nconstricting band is lubricated\nwith a water-soluble jelly and\nplaced around the chamber\nnear its open end. \u2022\nThe\njelly\nis\nnext\napplied\ngenerously to the base of the\npenis to assure an air-tight seal. \u2022\nThe penis is placed in the\nchamber and the vacuum is\napplied for 3 - 6 minutes or until\nit becomes rigid. \u2022\nThe constricting band is slid\noff the end of the chamber to\nconstrict the base of the penis. \u2022\nThe vacuum is then released\nand the chamber removed. Sexual\nintercourse\ncan\nbe\nperformed immediately after. \u2022\nThe band should not be left on\nlonger than 30 minutes. Management of Erectile Dysfunction\nAppendix 8\nLOW-INTENSITY EXTRACORPOREAL SHOCKWAVE THERAPY\nHow it works? \u2022\nWhile the patient is lying down, ultrasound gel is applied to the applicator head and/or the treatment area. \u2022\nThe applicator head is applied to areas of the penile shaft and crus. \u2022\nThe shockwave technology skilfully creates waves that treat a broad area from the superficial surface of the penile shaft to the deeper erectile\ntissues of the crura. \u2022\nIt is currently recommended that this treatment to be conducted once or twice a week, for at least 6 sessions. \u2022\nThe waves stimulate tissue and do not cause any pain or external scarring. Patients can resume daily regular activity after the procedure. Side\neffects (if any) are usually mild and temporary. \u2022\nMost patients report progress after 3 - 4 sessions. 1. Glans penis; 2.
