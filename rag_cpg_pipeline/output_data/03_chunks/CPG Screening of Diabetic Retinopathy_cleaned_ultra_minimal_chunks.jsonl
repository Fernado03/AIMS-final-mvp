They consisted\nof ophthalmologists, a paediatrician, an obstetrician & gynaecologist, a public\nhealth physician, a family medicine specialist, an optometrist, an assistant\nmedical officer and a nursing sister. There was active involvement of the Review\nCommittee during the process of development of these guidelines. Literature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: Guidelines\nInternational Network (G-I-N); Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD);\nPubMed; Ovid Medline, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews,\nEBM Reviews - Health Technology Assessment, Journals full text via OVID search\nengine (refer to Appendix 1 for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists\nof all retrieved articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Experts in the\nfield were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches were conducted\nbetween September 2009 and January 2011. Future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can\nbe obtained upon request from the CPG Seretariat. Reference was also made to other guidelines on Diabetic Retinopathy such as\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern Diabetic\nRetinopathy (2008) and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)\nAustralia Guidelines for the Management of Diabetic Retinopathy (2008). These\nCPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE) prior to them being used as references. The clinical questions were developed under three major subtopics and members\nof the Development Group were assigned individual questions within these\nsubtopics (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The group members met\na total of 16 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature\nretrieved was appraised by at least two members and presented in the form\nof evidence tables and discussed during Development Group meetings.", "chunk_order": 1}

Globally there\nis a rising trend in the prevalence of DM due to many factors such as aging,\nurbanisation and increasing prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity. The\nInternational Diabetes Federation (IDF) predicts that the prevalence of DM in\nSouth East Asia will increase by two folds by the year 2025.1, level III The World Health\nOrganization (WHO) has estimated that in the year 2030, Malaysia would have a\ntotal of 2.48 million people with DM.2, level III In Malaysia, the first National Health\nand Morbidity Survey I (NHMS I) conducted in 1986 reported a DM prevalence\nof 6.3%. This had risen to 8.3% in the NHMS II 1996 report. In the latest NHMS\nIII 2006 report, the overall prevalence of DM was 11.6% and 14.9% in those\naged above 18 and 30 years respectively. NHMS I and II involved subjects aged\nabove 30 years while NHMS III was conducted among subjects above 18 years of\nage.3, level III\nDM is a complex disease with end organ complications. However, good control\nof DM will prevent the onset or retard progression of the various complications\nincluding diabetic retinopathy (DR). In Malaysia, diabetic eye disease is the\ncommonest cause of visual loss among adults of working age. Prevalence of\nDR is closely linked to the duration of DM. At diagnosis, less than 5% will have\nretinopathy while the prevalence rises to 40 - 50% after 10 years.", "chunk_order": 4}

At diagnosis, less than 5% will have\nretinopathy while the prevalence rises to 40 - 50% after 10 years. Almost all\npatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and more than 60% patients with\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have some degree of retinopathy after 20 years\nof the disease.2, level III Screening and early treatment can prevent substantial visual\nloss in many cases. Late presentation continues to be a major challenge of\nprevention and alleviation of blindness. DM prevalence in Malaysia has dramatically risen to almost twice in the\nmagnitude over the last decade. In view of this, efforts to control this chronic\ndisease and early detection of complications such as DR should be intensified. This is important as DR is asymptomatic in its early stage when it is most easily\namenable to treatment. Therefore, a DR screening programme must be comprehensive, covering all\nindividuals with DM in Malaysia. SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY\n2. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND DIABETIC\nRETINOPATHY\nWHO estimates that the global prevalence of DM will increase from 2.8% to 4.4%\nfrom the year 2000 to 2030.4, level III Due to its chronicity, severity of complication\nand complexity of management, DM is a costly disease both for the affected\nindividuals and the health sector as a whole. DR is the leading cause of blindness and visual disability in adults of economically\ndeveloped societies in the Western Pacific Region.1, level III Its prevalence is closely\nlinked to the duration of DM and varies among nations and ethnicity.5, level III\n2.1 Prevalence and Incidence of Diabetes Mellitus\n2.1.1 Adults\nThe prevalence of DM among those aged more than 30 years in Malaysia has\nincreased alarmingly from 6.3% (1986) to 8.3% (1996) and 14.9% in 2006. There was also an increasing trend in the prevalence with age (2.0% among\nthose aged 18 - 19 years to 20.8 - 26.2% among aged 50 - 64 years).", "chunk_order": 5}

ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY\nA variety of screening modalities are available in detecting and classifying DR. Ophthalmoscopy is the most commonly used technique to screen for DR. However, non-mydriatic digital fundus photography is now being widely used. There is a wide variation in the sensitivities and specificities of different screening\nmodalities performed by different screeners. 5.1 Screening Tools\nThe instruments that can be used for screening are:\n\u2022\nDirect ophthalmoscope\n\u2022\nPAN-ophthalmoscope\n\u2022\nBinocular indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO)\n\u2022\nSlit lamp biomicroscope\n\u2022\nMydriatic fundus camera\n\u2022\nNon-mydriatic fundus camera\n5.1.1 Sensitivity and Specificity of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Tools\nThe UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that DR\nscreening modalities should have a sensitivity of at least 80%, a specificity of at\nleast 95% and a technical failure rate of no greater than 5%.28\nTable 2 describes the diagnostic accuracy of different screening tools. Nonmydriatic fundus camera has high sensitivity and specificity. It eliminates the\nneed for pupillary dilatation, promoting compliance, efficiency and safety. The\nfindings by Aptel F et al showed that at least one field photo assessment was\nsufficient to detect DR. However, the Training Module for DR Screening in Malaysia\nrecommends two fields photo assessment.29, level III\nSCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY\nTable 2: Sensitivity and Specificity of DR Screening Tools\nScreening tool\nSensitivity\nSpecificity\nDirect ophthalmoscope25\n45.0 - 98.0%\n62.0 - 100%\nSlit lamp biomicroscope30, level II-2\n87.4%\n94.9%\nMydriatic fundus camera25\n73.0 - 96.0%\n68.0 - 99.0%\nNon-mydriatic fundus camera31, level II-2\n92.0%\n97.0%\n5.1.2 Agreement between Non-mydriatic Fundus Camera versus\nOphthalmoscope and Mydriatic Fundus Camera\nAs a screening tool, non-mydriatic fundus camera has good inter-rater reliability with\nophthalmoscope (\u03ba=0.90)31, level II-2 and mydriatic fundus camera (\u03ba=0.80).32, level I\nRecommendation\n\u2022\nNon-mydriatic fundus camera should be used as a screening tool for\ndiabetic retinopathy (DR) when possible.", "chunk_order": 8}

SCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY\n5.3 Pupillary Dilatation\nNon-mydriatic fundus photography generally does not require pupil dilatation if\nperformed in an adequately darkened room. However, in cases of small pupil and\nungradable photos, pupillary dilatation can increase the sensitivity of screening\nby over 50%. Those performing DR screening should be aware of the possibility\nof inducing acute angle closure glaucoma in high risk individuals (history of\nglaucoma and shallow anterior chamber). The use of tropicamide 1% alone has\nnot been reported to cause this complication.37, level III\nThose intending to use tropicamide 1% should be aware of the possible side effects.

Therefore, patients should\nhave their first fundus examination at the time of diagnosis.43; 44, level III\n\u2022\nPregnant Women with Pre-existing DM\nDR can worsen during pregnancy because of changes in metabolic\nstatus. Individuals with DM planning for pregnancy should have their\neyes examined prior to conception and counselled on the risk of\ndevelopment and progression of DR.25; 43\n\u2022 Gestational DM (GDM)\nGDM is an abnormal glucose intolerance first detected during pregnancy. In general, DR screening is not required for GDM.25; 43 However, if GDM\nis diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy, screening should be as\nper pre-existing DM.

However, the Development\nGroup will ensure that the contents of this training module will be in tandem with\nthe recommendations in the CPG. There are three barriers in applying recommendations of the CPG in the local context:\ni. Patient factors\n\u2022\nLack of awareness of the possible complications of DM to the eye as DR\nmay remain asymptomatic\n\u2022\nPoor access to eye care services\n\u2022\nDifferent cultural beliefs\nii.

Financial allocation is proposed to\nindividual hospitals, health clinics and communities to achieve adequate access\nto eye screening. In view of the low percentage of DM patients screened for DR annually,3, level III the\ndevelopment group proposes the following clinical audit indicators for quality\nmanagement as part of ensuring the implementation of recommendations in the\nCPG:-\n\u2022 Percentage of T2DM\npatients screened for\nDR for the first time\n=\nNumber of T2DM patients screened\nfor DR for the first time within a year\nx 100%\nTotal number of newly registered\nT2DM patients within the same year\n\u2022 Percentage of\nungradable\nfundus photo\n=\nNumber of patients with ungradable\nfundus photo within a year\nx 100%\nTotal number of patients\u2019 fundus\nphotos taken within the same year\n\u2022 Percentage of diabetics\nscreened with\nsight threatening DR\n=\nNumber of diabetics screened with\nsight threatening DR within a year\nx 100%\nTotal number of diabetics screened for\nDR within the same year\nREFERENCES\nSCREENING OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY\nREFERENCES\n1.
