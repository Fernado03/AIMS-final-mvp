STATEMENT OF INTENT\nThis Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) is meant to provide guidance for the\nevidence-based clinical practice for managing obesity. It is based on the best\navailable evidence at the time of the CPG development. Adherence to the\nguidelines may not necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every\nhealthcare provider is responsible for the management of his/her unique patient\nbased on the clinical picture presented by the patients and the management\noptions available. Every care has been taken to ensure that the information in this publication is\ncorrect at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions,\ncorrections will be published in the web version of this document, which will serve\nas the definitive version at all times. NEXT UPDATE\nThe year of issue of this current CPG is 2023. It will be reviewed in 4 years (2027)\nor sooner if new evidence becomes available. The Chairman of the CPG or the\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be consulted to determine if there is a\nneed for a revision, and if so, the extent of the revision needed. A multidisciplinary\nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used by\nMalaysian Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed for\nthe next update. 01\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\nStatement of intent\n1\nNext update\n1\nTable of contents\n2\nTerms of reference\n5\nClinical questions\n7\nTarget population\n7\nTarget user\n7\nHealthcare settings\n8\nSource of funding and declaration of conflict of interest\n8\nDevelopment committee\n9\nReview committee\n11\nGrades of recommendation and levels of evidence\n12\nRecommendations\n13\nAlgorithms\n17\nAlgorithm for the assessment and management of adult obesity\n17\nAlgorithm for the assessment and management of childhood obesity\n18\nForeword by the Director General of Health, Malaysia\n19\nPreface by the Chairperson of the Development Committee\n20\n1.", "chunk_order": 0}

Although the\ncauses of obesity are complex and multifactorial, unhealthy lifestyle choices\nremain a significant risk factor.

Datuk Dr Muhammad Radzi bin Abu Hassan\nDirector General of Health, Malaysia\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\nPreface\nby the Chairperson of the Development Committee\nThe management of overweight and obesity is evolving. These guidelines are\nmotivated by the recognition that the prevalence of overweight and obesity\nin Malaysia is increasing, and healthcare practitioners need to be alert to the\nassociated health risks. Based on the National Health and Morbidity Survey\n2019, one in two Malaysians is overweight or obese. The excess weight is\noften accompanied by hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease,\nmetabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and other health issues. The 1st edition of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Obesity\nwas developed almost two decades ago, and it is timely to have the guidelines\nrevised. There have been many breakthroughs and advances in the management\nof obesity; through nutrition, different types of exercise, pharmacotherapy, and\nbariatric surgery. These guidelines used the principles of evidence-based medicine, and scientific\nevidence was examined thoroughly by the committee, by meticulously expoloring\nvarious treatment strategies and their effects on weight loss. Cognitive behaviour,\nwhich helps people with obesity sustain lifestyle changes and improve their\nquality of life, is emphasised in these guidelines. In addition, recognising that\noverweight and obesity among children and adolescents in Malaysia is on the rise,\na dedicated chapter has been developed to comprehensively address evaluating\nand managing this population. We hope these clinical guidelines will help healthcare practitioners understand\nthe importance of weight management and be able to assess and manage their\npatients effectively. It is equally important for people with obesity to obtain the\noptimum standard of care that they deserved. I would like to thank all members of the commitee for their tireless efforts in\nproducing the 2nd edition of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management\nof Obesity.

Obesity: the disease\n1.1 Introduction\nObesity is a complex and chronic disease that has a heterogenous presentation. The excess and unwanted body fat accumulation or adiposity lead to many\ncomplications and increased risk of premature morbidity and mortality. Studies\nhave shown that overweight and obesity increased the risk of chronic health\nconditions and reduced quality of life.1,2 [Level 1++] Hence, like any other chronic\ndisease, early recognition, appropriate and effective individualised intervention\nand long-term support are essential. Not only are overweight and obesity associated with chronic diseases like type\n2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome,\nosteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), it also increases the risk of\nseveral types of cancers.3 [Level 1+]\nApart from the impact that overweight and obesity have in reducing the quality\nof life and well-being, the physical, psychosocial functioning and perceptions of\nhealth of persons with obesity are greatly affected by the disease.4 [Level 1++]\nPersons with obesity experience stigma and discrimination at the workplace and\nat healthcare facilities. In addition to the morbidity and mortality associated with\nobesity, there are significant healthcare expenditures resulting from obesity\nassociated medical conditions. The total cost of obesity related healthcare spending in Malaysia is the highest\n(19.36%), compared to other ASEAN countries (<10%). The estimated productive\nyears lost for males and females associated with obesity in Malaysia is 6-11 years\nand 7-12 years respectively, and this has a negative impact to the overall economic\nstatus of the country.5\n1.2 Epidemiology\nThe increasing global prevalence of obesity is alarming. Malaysia is no exception. The National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2019 with a significant number of\nrespondents (n=16,688) determined the prevalence of overweight and obesity\nwere 32.3% and 33.7%, respectively (body mass index; BMI based on Asian cut-off\nscales). Generally, the prevalence of obesity increases with age.6 [Level 3] Although the\nprevalence of physically inactive adults was only 25.1% (NHMS 2015), the choice\nof unhealthy foods seems to be the contributing factor for obesity. Apart from\nthe NHMS data, smaller studies in targeted populations have also demonstrated\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\na significant prevalence of obesity.", "chunk_order": 10}

The prevalence of overweight and obesity\nin 2,221 adolescents between the age of 12 to 18 years were 17.0% and 14.9%,\nrespectively.7 A prospective nationwide study, The Malaysian Cohort (TMC),\ninvolving more than 100,000 multi ethnic respondents from both urban and rural\nsettings reported a baseline prevalence of obesity at approximately 17.7%.8\n1.3 Obesity as a disease\nObesity is a disease because it meets the definition \u2014 it decreases the life\nexpectancy and impairs the normal functioning of the body, has characteristic\nsigns and symptoms, increases morbidity and can be caused by genetic factors. Obesity is a health threat that is associated with an increased risk of other chronic\ndiseases including T2DM, fatty liver, cardiovascular disease, OSA, stroke, dementia\nand cancer.9\nThe overproduction of leptin secondary to excess adipose tissue and increased\nfood intake lead to abnormal energy expenditure. Additionally, obesity\ncontributes to mechanical problems within the body, namely pain of the hip\nand knee joints. Obesity is also linked to reproductive problems in both men\nand women and is associated with infertility and the risk of miscarriage. Obesity\nhas led to an increased risk of preventable early death, i.e., 29.5% for men and\n14.6% for women compared to those with a normal BMI (19% for men and 11% for\nwomen).10 [Level 1++]\n1.4 Impact of weight loss on associated medical conditions\nFor persons who have weight related medical conditions, reducing weight benefits\ntheir health and reduces the risk of additional problems related to obesity-related\ncomplications. A modest weight loss of 5% to 10% is associated with improvement in blood\npressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.11 [Level 1++] This is\neven more significant in those with a higher BMI where moderate weight loss is\nassociated with improvement in glucose, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein\n(LDL) cholesterol levels.12 [Level 1++] Weight loss of between 10% to 15% is needed\nto improve other clinical conditions such as OSA, osteoarthritis and steatotic\nhepatitis. Real-world data on the benefits of weight loss revealed the greatest\nbenefit for the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors that can be translated into\nreduction of morbidity and mortality.13 [Level 3]\nThese clinical practice guidelines intend to provide healthcare providers\ncomprehensive evidence-based guidance for screening and managing overweight\nand obesity, i.e., how to evaluate, treat, and manage a person with obesity while\nincorporating individual needs and preferences for improved clinical outcomes. 1.", "chunk_order": 11}

Obesity: the disease\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\n2. Assessment and diagnosis\n2.1 Screening\nAll adults should be screened annually using body mass index (BMI) measurement;\na cut-off point of \u226523 kg/m2 should be used to initiate further evaluation of\noverweight or obesity.14 [Level 2+]\nHowever, measurement of body fat can be used as an alternative to BMI for\nscreening for obesity. Truncal obesity can be an indicator of obesity-associated\nconditions, especially in those with lower BMI. 2.2 Diagnosis\nThe BMI is an international standard for measurement of obesity as recommended\nby the World Health Organization (WHO), however, it was based on Europids\nand did not accurately reflect other ethnic groups,15 e.g. in the Asian population,\nwhere morbidity and mortality occur at lower BMI and waist circumference.16,17\nThe BMI is still the most widely accepted measurement of obesity as it is easy to\naccess, affordable to measure, and can conveniently be used to monitor weight\nchanges. Asians generally have higher body fat percentages compared to Caucasians at\nsimilar BMI cut-off points.18 [Level 1++]19 [Level 2] Evidence from Asian countries\nreveal that the risk of comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),\nhypertension and other cardiovascular (CV) risks, begin to increase at lower\nBMI.20-23 [Level 1+]24 [Level 2+] Hence, the lower BMI cut-off points for overweight\nand obesity for the Asian population (Table 2-1). Classification of weight by BMI\nThe initial assessment of people with obesity should include height, weight and\nBMI (kg/m2). The classification of weight by BMI for the Asian population and its\nassociated CV risk are shown in Table 2-1.

The elderly tends to have a higher body fat composition as a result of age-related\nloss of lean body mass (sarcopenia), which can be misclassified as a healthy BMI.28\nTherefore, in this subgroup, the use of BMI for health risk assessment may be less\naccurate.28\nBMI also does not distinguish body fat distribution, a known determinant of\nmetabolic risk. Hence, the assessment of visceral adiposity which is a predictor for\nthe development of T2DM, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and CV mortality\nrisk, is a better parameter than total body fat alone.29 [Level 3]\nClassification by waist circumference\nAbdominal or visceral fat is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease\n(CVD).30 Waist circumference (WC) is measured in the horizontal plane, midway\nbetween the lowest ribs and the iliac crest (see Figure 2-A). Its measurement\ncorrelates well with abdominal fat content irrespective of the BMI.31 [Level 2+]\nWC is a very practical measurement for assessing excess fat around the abdomen. There are other ways to measure body fat but most of these methods are not\nreadily available or convenient in clinical settings. These include:\n\u2022 skin-fold calliper measurement\n\u2022 hydrodensitometry\n\u2022 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\n2.

For those with a BMI >35 kg/m2 it\nis unnecessary to measure WC as it loses its predictive value.32 [Level 2+]\nFigure 2-A.

In\naddition to the obvious environmental drivers, multiple common and rare genetic\nvariants contribute to substantial heritability for BMI and waist circumference\n(WC).137 Children with primary obesity usually have accelerated growth. These\nchildren are at risk for early development of secondary sexual characteristics and\nmay have advanced bone age.136\nSecondary obesity\nPathological causes or secondary obesity are uncommon but should be carefully\nconsidered, such as endocrinopathies (Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hypothyroidism and\nhypopituitarism), and syndromic/genetic conditions (e.g., pseudohypoparathyroidism\nand Prader Willi syndrome). Children with endocrinopathies may have decreased\nlinear growth or short stature.138 Clinicians should refer maturing children who are\nobese with short stature and decreased growth velocity despite continued weight\ngain for further evaluation. Patients with genetic obesity usually have an early onset of obesity (<5 years of\nage), clinical features of genetic obesity syndromes and/or a family history of\nextreme obesity.139\n5.

The United States\nPreventive Services Taskforce updated their recommendation in 2018 to include\nintensive behavioural counselling for individuals of normal weight with abnormal\nblood glucose levels or diabetes.183\nPrimary prevention measures are essential to halt the development of obesity as\nearly as possible.

In addition, research indicates the need for parental involvement and a whole\nfamily approach for successful prevention programmes.151 Any preventive\nprogramme will, therefore, need to involved the whole family to advocate good\nparenting practices and lifestyle choices.

There is evidence that supports the use of school-based preventive programmes\nwith family and community reinforcement.195\nSome measures that can be used to promote obesity prevention within schools\nare: [\uf052; Level 4]\n\u2022 School curriculum that includes healthy diet, importance of physical activity\nand positive body image\n\u2022 Increasing physical activity sessions and the development of fundamental\nmovement skills throughout the school week\n\u2022 Improving the nutritional quality of foods in schools\n\u2022 Supporting teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies\nand activities\nDiet and physical activity\nDietary interventions, ranging from brief advice or counselling to structured\nmanagement by health professionals, have been studied the most. The use\nof multicomponent interventions focusing on dietary, physical activity and\nbehavioural aspects may be useful depending on the age-group, settings and\navailable resources. Also, the implementation of multidisciplinary childhood\nobesity intervention programmes in the clinical setting should involve a team of\ncare providers including a psychologist, trained nurse, dietitian, physiotherapist\nand exercise specialist.196 [Level 1-]\nLifestyle intervention would have to be comprehensive involving the whole\nfamily and the environment the child lives in.", "chunk_order": 53}

Main findings from literature\nindicate using school-based preventive programmes with family and community\nreinforcement.195 Research has indicated the need for parental involvement and a\nwhole family approach in the success of prevention programmes.151,197\nIn children \u22646 years old\nData from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 520 children focused\nsolely on dietary intervention suggested little to no difference in BMI Z-score\nreductions in children \u22645 years old.198 [Level 1-]\n6. Prevention of overweight and obesity in adults, children\nand adolescents\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\nA Cochrane review of 153 RCTs by Brown et al. in 2019 reported that a range of\ninterventions focusing on both diet and physical activity components contributed\nto a modest effect on obesity prevention in children aged 0 up to 12 years.199\n[Level 1++] In children \u22645 years old,\n\u2022 There was a pooled reduction of 0.07 units (95% CI -0.14, -0.01) in BMI Z-score\nfrom combined diet and physical activity interventions\n\u2022 There was a BMI reduction of 0.11 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.21, 0.00) from combined diet\nand physical activity interventions\nWhile being modest, diet and physical activity behaviours adopted early in life\nsuggests that these behaviours track to later ages in life when the health benefits\nmight be seen.198 [Level 1-]\nIn another Cochrane review of RCTs involving children aged 0-6 years old\nassigned to combination of interventions focusing on diet, physical activity and\nbehavioural components vs usual care,200 [Level 1++] there were greater BMI\nZ-score reductions on follow-up with mean difference of:\n\u2022 -0.3 units (95% CI -0.4, -0.2) at 6 to 12 months\n\u2022 -0.4 units (95% CI -0.6, -0.2) at 12-18 months\n\u2022 -0.3 units (95% CI -0.4, -0.1) at 2 years\nIn children 6-12 years old\nIn children aged 6-12 years who received a combination of dietary and\nphysical activity interventions compared to those assigned to the control group\ndemonstrated,199 [Level 1++]\n\u2022 Reduction in their BMI Z-score (mean difference -0.05 units, 95% CI -0.10, -0.01)\n\u2022 Reduction in their BMI (mean difference -0.05 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.11, -0.01),\nthough it was not statistically significant.

Other inconsistencies\nwere also observed in the settings where the RCTs were conducted as well as the\nduration of the follow-up. 6.2.3 Environment\nPreventive measures for obesity will need to include changes in the environment. Availability and accessibility to greenspaces, parks, recreational facilities, and\nsidewalks were found to be associated with increased physical activity levels and\nreduced sedentary behaviour in children.203\n6.

I don't have any difficulty eating slowly in the proper manner. Although I seem to be \"gobble down\" foods, I don't end up feeling\nstuffed because of eating too much. At times, I tend to eat quickly and then, I feel uncomfortably full\nafterwards. I have the habit of bolting down my food, without really chewing it. When this happens I usually feel uncomfortably stuffed because I've\neaten too much. 3. I feel capable to control my eating urges when I want to. I feel like I have failed to control my eating more than the average\nperson. I feel utterly helpless when it comes to feeling in control of my eating\nurges. Because I feel so helpless about controlling my eating I have become\nvery desperate about trying to get in control. Appendices\n93\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\n4. I don't have the habit of eating when I'm bored. I sometimes eat when I'm bored, but often I'm able to \"get busy\" and\nget my mind off food. I have regular habit of eating when I'm bored, but occasionally, I can\nuse some other activity to get my mind off eating. I have a strong habit of eating when I'm bored. Nothing seems to help\nme break the habit. 5. I'm usually physically hungry when I eat something. Occasionally, I eat something on impulse even though I really am not\nhungry. I have the regular habit of eating foods, that I might not really enjoy, to\nsatisfy a hungry feeling even though physically, I don't need the food. Although I'm not physically hungry, I get a hungry feeling in my mouth\nthat only seems to be satisfied my mouth hunger, I then spit the food\nout so I won't gain weight. 6. I don't feel any guilt or self-hate after I overeat. After I overeat, occasionally I feel guilt or self-hate. Almost all the time I experience strong guilt or self-hate after I overeat. 7. I don't lose total control of my eating when dieting even after periods\nwhen I overeat. Sometimes when I eat a \"forbidden food\" on a diet , I feel like I \"blew it\"\nand eat even more. Frequently, I have the habit of saying to myself, \"I've blown it now, why\nnot go all the way\" when I overeat on a diet. When that happens I eat\neven more.", "chunk_order": 58}

I have a regular habit of starting strict diets for myself, but I break the\ndiets by going on an eating binge. My life seems to be either a \"feast\"\nor \"famine\". 8. I rarely eat so much food that I feel uncomfortably stuffed afterwards. Usually about once a month, I eat such a quantity of food, I end up\nfeeling very stuffed. I have regular periods during the month when I eat large amounts of\nfood, either at mealtime or at snacks. I eat so much food that I regularly feel quite uncomfortable after eating\nand sometimes a bit nauseous. Appendices\n94\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\n9. My level of calorie intake does not go up very high or go down very low\non a regular basis. Sometimes after I overeat, I will try to reduce my calorie intake to almost\nnothing to compensate for the excess calories I've eaten. I have a regular habit of overeating during the night. It seems that my\nroutine is not to be hungry in the morning but overeat in the evening. In my adult years, I have had week-long periods where I practically\nstarve myself. This follows periods when I overeat. It seems I live a life of\neither \"feast or famine\". 10. I usually am able to stop eating when I want to. I know when \"enough\nis enough\". Every so often, I experience a compulsion to eat which I can't seem to\ncontrol. Frequently, I experience strong urges to eat which I seem unable to\ncontrol, but at other times I can control my eating urges. I feel incapable of controlling urges to eat. I have a fear of not being\nable to stop eating voluntarily. 11. I don't have any problem stopping eating when I feel full. I usually can stop eating when I feel full but occasionally overeat\nleaving me feeling uncomfortably stuffed. I have a problem stoppinge eating once I start and usually I feel\nuncomfotably stuffed after I eat a meal. Because I have a problem not being able to stop eating when I want, I\nsometimes have to induce vomiting to relieve my stuffed feeling. 12. I seem to eat just as much when I'm with others (family, social\ngatherings) as when I'm by myself. Sometimes, when I'm with other persons, I don't eat as much as I want\nto eat because I'm self-conscious about my eating.", "chunk_order": 59}

Sometimes, when I'm with other persons, I don't eat as much as I want\nto eat because I'm self-conscious about my eating. Frequently, I eat only a small amount of food when others are present,\nbecause I'm very embarrassed about my eating. I feel so ashamed about overeating that I pick times to overeat when I\nknow no one will see me. I feel like a \"closet eater\". Appendices\n95\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OBESITY 2ND EDITION (2023)\n13. I eat 3 meals a day with only an occasional between meal snack. I eat 3 meals a day, but I also normally snack between meals. When I am snacking heavily, I get in the habit of skipping regular meals. There are regular periods when I seem to be continually eating, with no\nplanned meals. 14. I don't think much about trying to control unwanted eating urges. At least some of the time, I feel my thoughts are pre-occupied with\ntrying to control my eating urges. I feel that frequently I spend much time thinking about how much I ate\nor about trying not to eat urges. I feel that frequently I spend much time thinking about how much I ate\nor about trying not to eat anymore. It seems to me that most of my waking hours are pre-occupied by\nthoughts about eating or not eating. I feel like I'm constantly struggling\nnot to eat. 15. I don't think about food a great deal. I have strong cravings for food but they last only for brief periods of\ntime. I have days when I can't seem to think about anything else but food. Most of my days seem to be pre-occupied with thoughts about food. I\nfeel like I live to eat. 16. I usually know whether or not I'm physically hungry. I take the right\nportion of food to satisfy me. Occasionally, I feel uncertain about knowing whether or not I'm\nphysically hungry. At these times it's hard to know how much food I\nshould take to satisfy me.
