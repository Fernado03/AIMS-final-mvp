They are intended as a guide for the best clinical practice in\nthe management of anterior crossbite in the mixed dentition presently. However, it must be noted that adherence to these guidelines do not\nnecessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care,\nas every health care provider is responsible for the management of his/\nher unique patient based on the clinical presentation and management\noptions available locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in November 2023 and will be reviewed\nin 2028 or earlier if important new evidence becomes available. When\nit is due for updating, the head of the related specialty will be informed\nabout it. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will\nbe done on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised\nCPG. The systematic review methodology used by the Malaysia\nHealth Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed in\nreviewing the guidelines. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

The scope has\nbeen expanded to include new and updated information. In addition,\nclinical audit indicators have also been identified for the purpose of\nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic\nReviews (CDSR) and Embase while full text journal articles were\nretrieved from these databases. The literature search was limited to\nhuman study, English language and published articles from 2012 to\nApril 2023. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. An example of the search strategy used can be found in Appendix 1. Details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the\nCPG Secretariat. There were five (5) clinical questions which were assigned to members\nof the development group. The group members met a total of 13\ntimes throughout the development of these guidelines. All retrieved\narticles were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme\n(CASP) checklist by at least two (2) members, presented in the form of\nevidence tables and discussed during group meetings. All statements\nand recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the\ndevelopment group and reviewers. This CPG is based on the findings\nof systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, observational\nstudies and case reports, with local practices taken into consideration. However, when there was lack of evidence, recommendations were\nbased on consensus of group members. Although ideally patients\u2019\nviews and preferences need to be considered in the development of\nCPGs, in this instance, it was not feasible. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US /\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the formulation of recommendation was done using the principles\nManagement of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\nvi\nof GRADE. The writing of the CPG strictly follows the requirements of\nAppraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE II). The draft was reviewed by a panel of internal and external reviewers. Recommendations were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee\nfor CPGs, and finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry of Health,\nMalaysia for approval.

Rarely this problem will need to be\ncorrected at the primary dentition stage; rather the child\u2019s jaw growth\nand anterior bite will have to be monitored during the onset of early\npermanent dentition stage. The prevalence of anterior crossbite differs among regions and\nethnicities. Between 2.2 and 11.0% of people in the European region\nare experiencing anterior crossbite. A study conducted in Shanghai\nfound that 10.5% of children between the ages of 7 and 9 had anterior\ncrossbite.(2) According to a cross-sectional study in Malaysia, 7.7% of\n12-year-old Malay students had an anterior crossbite.(3)\nAnterior crossbite in mixed dentition can lead to several functional and\naesthetic issues that can impact a child\u2019s oral health and overall wellbeing. It can affect the child\u2019s ability to bite and chew food properly. In addition to functional challenges, the abnormal tooth alignment can\ncause tooth wear and enamel damage. Gingival recession and loss\nof periodontal attachment may also occur due to the improper forces\nexerted on the gingiva as a result of the malpositioned teeth. Furthermore,\nanterior crossbite can contribute to mandibular displacement, where\nthe lower jaw shifts to accommodate the malalignment. An anterior\ncrossbite also may reveal an underlying jaw problem that is best\naddressed at a young age, while the face and jaws are still developing.(4)\nTherefore, anterior crossbite should be treated early in order to avoid a\nmore complex and complicated treatment for the patient in the future. Early intervention can address anterior crossbite in mixed dentition. Depending on the severity of the anterior crossbite, the child\u2019s age, and\nother factors, various orthodontic appliances may be used, including\nremovable appliances, fixed appliances, or protraction facemasks and\nothers. These appliances gradually shift the misaligned teeth into their\nproper positions, promoting improved function and aesthetics. With new developments in the management of patients with anterior\ncrossbite in mixed dentition, this CPG is updated to include latest\nevidence on the management of anterior crossbite of dental origin\nin mixed dentition using different treatment modalities such as lower\nManagement of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n2\ninclined bite plane and cemented bite pads. This CPG also includes\ndocumented evidence for the treatment of anterior crossbites of skeletal\norigin, including class III malocclusions using protraction masks with or\nwithout RME and skeletal anchored Class III elastics.

It could\nbe due to:\n\u2022 crowding of teeth that can cause the maxillary incisors to be displaced\nlingually(1, 5)\n\u2022 presence of supernumerary teeth that interferes with the eruption of\nmaxillary tooth(1, 5)\n\u2022 traumatic injuries to the primary dentition can cause lingual\ndisplacement of the maxillary permanent tooth bud.(5)\n\u2022 trauma to permanent teeth can cause them to be displaced, resulting\nin anterior crossbite(5)\n\u2022 over-retained primary incisors can cause the permanent teeth to\nerupt lingually, leading to anterior crossbite(1, 5)\n2.2\nFunctional\nA change in anterior function during closure from centric relation to\ncentric occlusion due to habit of placing the mandible forward can lead\nto an anterior crossbite. It may be the result of premature occlusal\ninterference that forces the lower jaw to move forward or laterally to\nachieve maximum occlusion.(5)\n2.3\nSkeletal\nSkeletal anterior crossbite usually results from retarded maxillary\ngrowth or excessive mandibular growth or the combination of both. Generally, the more anterior teeth in crossbite, the more severe the\nunderlying skeletal problem.(6)\nIt can be associated with the following factors:\n\u2022 strong familial inheritance contributes to the development of a Class\nIII skeletal pattern, which can lead to anterior crossbite(5)\n\u2022 scar tissue from cleft lip and palate repair can restrain the growth of\nthe maxilla, resulting in a narrow maxilla and anterior crossbite(5)\n\u2022 overdevelopment of mandible in craniofacial dysostosis, cleidocranial\ndysplasia and hormonal disturbances such as acromegaly and\ngigantism(5)\n\u2022 trauma or fractures to the jaws can cause skeletal abnormalities and\nanterior crossbite\nManagement of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n4\n3.0\nTYPES OF ANTERIOR CROSSBITE\nAccording to aetiological factors, anterior crossbite can be classified\ninto three types;(5)\n3.1\nDental Anterior Crossbite\nDental anterior crossbite are generally localised in nature, involving\nlingually displaced maxillary central or lateral incisors. It does not have\nunderlying skeletal problems.(1, 5)\n3.2\nFunctional Anterior Crossbite (Pseudo Class III)\nThis is a type of anterior crossbite caused by occlusal interferences\nbetween upper and lower incisor(s) which leads to forward displacement\nof the mandible in order to achieve maximum intercuspation.", "chunk_order": 8}

The greater the number of teeth in crossbite, the greater the skeletal\ncomponent of the aetiology.(6) Early treatment may not be successful\nin all patient with Class III skeletal problem due to the unpredictability\nof the growth patterns, hence consultation with a specialist is required. Management of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n5\n4.0\nEARLY INTERVENTION\nAnterior crossbite may potentially have a detrimental effect on the\ndevelopment of skeletal and dentoalveolar structures. Therefore,\nearly correction around 6-10 years old is important to prevent the\nproblem from worsening and becoming more difficult to manage. Early\nintervention typically starts when the permanent incisor(s) are erupting\nin a crossbite position (7-8 years old). The rationale for early intervention are:\n\u2022 a crossbite has little possibility of self-correction\n\u2022 a crossbite in the primary dentition may lead to development of\ncrossbite in the permanent dentition(7)\n\u2022 postponing treatment may result in prolonged treatment of greater\ncomplexity(7)\n\u2022 a functional crossbite can develop from cuspal interference, resulting\nin a mandibular shift(7)\n\u2022 to improve maxillary lip posture and facial appearance(7)\n4.1\nImplications of delayed or no treatment\nIf left untreated, anterior crossbite may lead to:(7)\n\u2022 damage to the teeth in crossbite through attrition. \u2022 mobility of the lower incisor due to labial displacement of this tooth\naccompanied by loss of gingival attachment labially. \u2022 gingival recession and loss of alveolar bone support to the opposing\nlower incisor. \u2022 the potential adverse growth influences on the mandible and anterior\nportion of the maxilla. \u2022 constant protrusion of the mandibular condyle from the fossa may\nstimulate growth of the mandible. 4.2 Consideration before embarking on early intervention\n(interceptive treatment) :\nThe following factors need to be considered before early intervention of\nanterior crossbite in mixed dentition:(7)\n\u2022 oral hygiene status\n\u2022 the severity of the underlying skeletal discrepancy\n\u2022 the amount of dentoalveolar compensation that has taken place\n(proclined upper incisors and retroclined lower incisors)\n\u2022 the amount of overbite present\n\u2022 patient\u2019s compliance\n\u2022 patient\u2019s overall health condition\nManagement of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n6\nRecommendation 1\nAnterior crossbite among patients in mixed dentition should be corrected\nearly to prevent unwanted complications\nManagement of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n7\n5.0\nEXAMINATION AND DIAGNOSIS\nEarly recognition and correct diagnosis of anterior crossbite are essential\nto determine suitable treatment and subsequently achieve a successful\noutcome.

Management of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n12\n6.0\nTREATMENT\nThe main aim of anterior crossbite treatment is to correct the relationship\nbetween the affected maxillary tooth or teeth to a point of a stable\noverbite relationship to prevent relapse. Simple interceptive treatment,\nsuch as extraction of adjacent primary teeth (under specialist advice)\ncan sometimes help to prevent the development of a crossbite, if\ntreated early.

(Refer Appendix 3 for\nsummary). Apart from achieving a correct diagnosis, it is also important\nManagement of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n13\nto assess the patient\u2019s compliance and motivation before deciding the\ntreatment that best suits the patient. 6.1.1 Upper Removable Appliance (URA)\nRemovable appliance is an appliance that is not attached to the teeth\nand can be removed by the patient for the purpose of cleaning. It is\nusually used to move teeth and correct the problem. The appliance\nis typically fitted in the upper arch and consists of an acrylic (plastic)\nplate, wire components for tooth movement, as well as retention of the\nappliance in the mouth (examples in Figure 5a and Figure 5b).

It consists of four important components:\nTo date, there is no evidence suggesting any particular design is more\neffective than the other in treating anterior crossbite in the mixed\ndentition. Thus, the design of the URA should be customised according\nto the patient\u2019s malocclusion, clinicians\u2019 preferences and technicians\u2019\nskills. ii\nManagement of Removable Appliance\nRemovable appliance management involves monitoring and maintaining\nremovable appliance throughout the patient\u2019s treatment period. This\nincludes all responsibilities and processes necessary to ensure proper\ncare and handling of the appliance. a. Fitting of Removable Appliance\nDuring the appliance fitting appointment, the clinician should ensure\nthe appliance fits properly and is comfortable for the patient to wear. In addition, clear instructions for inserting, removing and care of the\nappliance should be explained and demonstrated to the patient and\nparents. 1. Before placing a removable appliance in the patient\u2019s mouth,\nensure that it is the correct appliance for the patient and the design\nis followed. 2. Explain to the patient how the appliance works. COMPONENTS\nFUNCTION\n\u2022 Provide forces to move teeth. Mainly by applying\ntipping force to the tooth / teeth forward. \u2022 Eg: Z spring, recurved spring, expansion screw etc\nActive\ncomponent\n\u2022 A source of resistance to the reaction from the active\ncomponents\n\u2022 Eg: Baseplate, retentive components\nAnchorage\ncomponent\nBaseplate\n\u2022 Ensure the appliance is retentive and comfortable to\nwear\n\u2022 Facilitate the active component(s) stay in place to\nfunction efficiently\n\u2022 Eg: Adam\u2019s clasp, Southend clasp, Ball-ended clasp etc\nRetentive\ncomponent\n\u2022 Hold together the other components of the appliance. \u2022 Can be incorporated with a posterior bite plane to free\nthe occlusion and allow the tooth in crossbite to move\nforward effectively.

Give clear instructions to the patient and parents/guardian, stressing\non the importance of full-time wear. (refer Appendix 5)\n7. Arrange for review appointment. b. Review appointment\nIdeally, patients with removable appliance should be seen every 4-6\nweeks. During the review appointment, the most important aspect is to\nassess the patient\u2019s compliance. The signs for the lack of compliance\ninclude:\n\u2022 presence of lisping\n\u2022 pooling of saliva\n\u2022 absence of appliance looks very new and absence of wear and tear\nmarks\n\u2022 no appliance imprint in the mouth\n\u2022 frequent breakages\n\u2022 inability to insert and remove the appliance unaided\n\u2022 active component is still active\nIf the patient\u2019s compliance is good, examine for:\n\u2022 oral hygiene status, presence of caries or gingivitis\n\u2022 overjet and overbite\n\u2022 correction/ improvement of the crossbite\nIf the crossbite is not fully corrected, the clinician needs to continue\nactivation of the active components. Successful correction of\nanterior crossbite should be achieved within 6-9 months. If there\nis no improvement after 9 months, referral to a specialist for further\nmanagement is needed. Positive overbite is essential to maintain\nstable results. No retainer is required if sufficient overbite is achieved to\nmaintain the correction.(7)\nFigure 6: Pre-treatment\nFigure 7: Post-treatment frontal\nfrontal photo\nphoto showing corrected anterior\ncrossbite with sufficient overbite\nManagement of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n16\n6.1.2 Lower Inclined Bite Plane\nLower inclined bite plane is an appliance uses natural forces which\ncreates a slight lingual movement in the mandibular teeth, while\ngenerating labial movement in the maxillary teeth.(9, 10) It can be removed\nor cemented to the mandibular incisors with luting glass ionomer\ncement or composite [Refer Figure 8(11)]. This can be used in patients\nwho are unable to tolerate or have poor compliance to URA. One of the\ncommonly used lower inclined bite planes is Catlan\u2019s appliance. Figure 8: Correction of anterior crossbite using lower inclined bite plane\nIn a systematic review, one RCT reported that the Catlan\u2019s appliance\nhad the longest treatment duration (21 days) compared with the URA (15\ndays) and fixed appliances (11 days).(12) Patients with Catlan\u2019s appliances\nalso had communication problems during treatment.(13), level I However,\nthis RCT had unclear methods for generating random sequences, as\nwell as blinding and allocation concealment. 6.1.3 Cemented Bite Pads\nCemented bite pads, also known as bite risers which are resinreinforced glass ionomer cement that are placed on lower first molars to\ndisengage the occlusion.

Management of Anterior Crossbite (3rd Edition)\n18\n6.1.4 Fixed Appliance\nFixed appliance (refer Figure 10) are orthodontic device / braces which\nare attached onto the surfaces of teeth and cannot be removed by the\npatient. In treating anterior crossbite, a simple sectional fixed appliance\nis preferred when three-dimensional tooth movement including bodily\nmovement, root torquing, derotation and movement of multiple teeth is\nneeded.(15)\nFigure 10: Fixed appliances on anterior crossbite\nIn a recent systematic review, an RCT on treatment of anterior crossbite\nwith functional shift in mixed dentition using 8 bonded-brackets fixed\nappliance and removable appliance, found that treatment time for fixed\nappliance (5.5 months) was significantly shorter compared to removable\nappliance (6.9 months). Furthermore, fixed appliance produces\nsignificantly greater effectiveness in terms of increased overjet (p<0.05)\nand arch length measurements (p<0.01) (arch length to incisal edge\nand arch length gingival) compared to removable appliance. Both\nappliances cause a low to moderate pain intensity, but generally were\nwell tolerated.

The choice of treatment depends on the clinician\u2019s\nassessment and expertise. (Refer Appendix 3 for summary)\n6.3.1 Protraction Facemask\nProtraction facemask (PFM), also known as reverse-pull headgear\nis an interceptive orthopaedic device used to treat young children in\nearly mixed dentition with maxillary deficiency preferably around the\nage 8 to 9 years old.(16-18) Facemask can be used either as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other maxillary arch expansion\nappliances.

As for stability, not all effects from chin cup will be sustainable in the\nlong term until patient growth completion. The role of chin cup therapy in the retardation of mandibular growth in\nthe long term is not conclusive. There are insufficient articles reported\nfor the long-term effect of chin cup therapy and it is difficult to obtain\nlong term cooperation from patients to wear chin cup until the growth is\ncomplete. In addition, chin cup therapy is not suitable for patients with\nopen bite or significant reverse OJ. 6.3.3 Skeletal Anchored Class III Elastics\nSkeletal anchored Class III elastics involves class III elastics applied from\ninfra-zygomatic mini-plates / mini-screws in the maxilla to symphyseal\nmini-plates / mini-screws in the mandible.(1) (refer Appendix 6)\nA meta-analysis, with 9 moderate quality studies (8 case-control studies\nand 1 controlled clinical study), reported that skeletal anchorage group,\nwhen compared to no treatment control groups showed significantly\nincreased in Wits values effect size (WDM= 7.8mm, 95% CI 7.19 to\n8.14), overjet effect size (WDM= 6.52mm, 95% CI 6.17 to 6.88), ANB\n(WDM= 6.07\u00b0, 95% CI 5.56 to 6.58) and SNA (WDM= 2.70\u00b0, 95% CI\n2.16 to 3.24).

Therefore, it is important for these guidelines to be disseminated to\nall healthcare professionals in primary and secondary healthcare\nfacilities. This can be facilitated through the development of appropriate\ntraining modules and quick references. Several factors may affect the\nimplementation of the recommendations of the CPG. 7.1\nFacilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare professionals and\nteaching institutions via printed and electronic copies\n\u2022 continuing professional education on the management of anterior\ncrossbite in mixed dentition for healthcare professionals\n\u2022 adequate facilities at primary and secondary care level for diagnosing\nand treating anterior crossbite in mixed dentition. \u2022 Existing barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 lack of understanding or limited knowledge on the management of\nanterior crossbite in mixed dentition. \u2022 variation in skills and treatment practices. \u2022 constraints in equipment and facilities\n7.2\nPotential Resource Implications\nThis CPG recommends early detection and referral, comprehensive\nassessment and treatment of anterior crossbite in mixed dentition. This\nrequires increased awareness among healthcare providers and the\npublic to establish early diagnosis and uninterrupted various forms of\ntreatment as well as support to the patients and their caregivers.
