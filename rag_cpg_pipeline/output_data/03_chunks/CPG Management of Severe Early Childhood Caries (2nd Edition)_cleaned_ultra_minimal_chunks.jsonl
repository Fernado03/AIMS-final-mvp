DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe Development Group for this Clinical Practice Guideline\n(CPG) consisted of paediatric dental specialists, academics and\ndental public health specialists. The Review Committee was\nactively involved in the development process of this guideline. The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Severe\nEarly Childhood Caries was first published in 2005 and since\nthen, there has been new evidence on diagnosis and\nmanagement of this condition. This revision aims to include\nmore target groups and give a greater emphasis on caries risk\nassessment and prevention of early childhood caries. The key\nelements of this revised CPG are improvements to the general\ntext, photographic updates, and simple messages based on upto-date evidence and treatment approaches. Literature search was carried out at the following electronic\ndatabases: PUBMED/MEDLINE, SUMSearch, Trip Database,\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR), Journal full\ntext via OVID search engine and Database of Abstracts of\nReviews of Effectiveness (DARE). The following free text terms\nor MeSH terms were used either singly or in combination to\nretrieve the articles: tooth, dental, decay, caries, rampant,\nbottle, nursing, baby and child. All searches were conducted\nbetween March 2010 and August 2011 and only literatures in\nEnglish were retrieved. In addition, reference was also made to\nother guidelines on Early Childhood Caries e.g. American\nAcademy of Paediatric Dentistry 2009, European Academy of\nPaediatric Dentistry 2008 and Scottish Dental Clinical\nEffectiveness Programme. These CPGs were evaluated using\nthe Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE) prior to them being used as references. This CPG is largely based on the findings of systematic\nreviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials. The levels of\nevidence of the literature were graded using the adapted\nversion of United States/Canadian Preventive Services Task\nForce\nLevel\nof\nEvidence,\nwhile\nthe\ngrading\nof\nrecommendations was based on the modified version of the\nScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).", "chunk_order": 1}

Clinical questions were developed under six major subtopics\nand members of the review group were assigned individual\nquestions within these subtopics. Relevant literature retrieved\nwere appraised by at least two members and presented in the\nform of evidence tables and discussed during review group\nmeetings. All statements and recommendations formulated\nwere agreed by the review group and where evidence was\ninsufficient;\nrecommendations\nwere\nmade\nbased\non\nconsensus of the group members. Although, ideally patient views and preferences should be\nconsidered in the development of CPGs, in this instance, it was\nnot considered feasible. Nevertheless, patient information\nleaflets would be developed to facilitate the dissemination of\nimportant information to the public. The draft guidelines were reviewed by a team of external\nreviewers and posted on the Ministry of Health, Malaysia\nwebsite for comments and feedbacks. These guidelines were\npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and\nfinally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry of Health,\nMalaysia for approval\nOBJECTIVE\nTo provide evidence-based guidelines in the management of\nsevere early childhood caries for the best possible outcomes. CLINICAL QUESTIONS\nThe clinical questions for these guidelines are:\n1. What are the causes of severe early childhood caries (SECC)? 2. What are the clinical presentations of S-ECC? 3. What are the methods used for diagnosis of S-ECC? 4. What factors are useful to identify children at risk of SECC? 5. What are the methods for preventing S-ECC? 6. What are the principles of management of S-ECC? TARGET POPULATION\nThese guidelines are applicable to children who are potentially\nat risk of developing early childhood caries (ECC) and those\ndiagnosed with S-ECC.

CARIES RISK\nDental caries is a transmissible infectious disease and\nunderstanding the acquisition of cariogenic microbes improves\npreventive strategies. Certain risk factors, behaviours or habits\nthat give cause for prolonged presence of fermentable cariogenic\nsubstrates, or a high oral cariogenic bacterial count may cause\nthe child to be at risk for dental decay. 2.1\nRisk Factors\nThe causes of caries are multi-factorial, and the individual risk\nfactors associated with ECC are therefore not necessarily\ncausative. The Fisher-Owen diagram26 Level III (Fig 4) summarizes\nthe complicated interaction between oral health influenced by\nenvironment at child, family and community levels. Fig 4. Child, family, and community influences on oral health\noutcomes of children (Fisher-Owens). The following is a list of some of the major factors\ni. Dietary Habits\nHigh frequency consumption of sugary foods and drinks are\nrisk indicators for caries.27-28 level l\nii. Bottle feeding\nFrequent bottle feeding with sucrose-containing infant feed,\nespecially night time, is a risk indicator for caries in young\nchildren.29 level lll\niii.

Conducting caries risk assessment can potentially identify those\nat risk even before manifestation of carious lesions.41 level ll-3\nThe risk factors are assessed by an interview with the parent\nand clinical examination of the child.

The\ninitial appearance of ECC is the presence of opaque white\nspots which usually starts at the cervical third of upper anterior\nteeth. It could then affect the occlusal of upper deciduous\nmolars, upper canines followed by lower deciduous molars,\nlower canines and lower incisors progressing into yellowish\nbrown carious lesions.41 level ll-3 In advanced S-ECC, the lesion\nmay progress to expose pulp tissue and breakdown as retained\nroots. A full mouth clinical examination is carried out by a thorough\nvisual examination with a good light source and a dry field. If\nthere is any gross plaque deposit, they should be removed by\nwiping the surface with gauze. Dental examinations by visual\ninspection with the aid of plane mouth mirrors are the most\nuseful for diagnosing carious lesions. Probing is not an\nacceptable method for diagnosing caries in pits and fissure, but\nmay be useful when assessing caries activity in exposed\ndentine. Diagnosing gross caries in children with conventional\nmethods such as visual and tactile examination is usually\nsufficient.42-43 level l\n3.2\nRadiographic Examination\nThe broad contact points of the primary dentition make\ndiagnosis of approximal caries difficult. Therefore, bitewing\nradiographs (Fig.5) are an important adjunct in detecting\nproximal caries for children age four and above.44-45 level lll If a\nchild is uncooperative for bitewings, a bi-maxillary oblique\nlateral view may be obtained. Orthopantomograms are not\nroutinely used for caries diagnosis. Fig 5. Bitewing radiographs\n3.3\nOther Investigations\nAlthough salivary flow rate and salivary buffering capacity are\nsaid to influence the development of dental decay, it is not\nrecommended to routinely investigate this in the diagnosis of\nECC. Typical clinical presentation of S-ECC can alert the parents,\ncaregivers and other health personnel during their regular\ncontact within the non-dental setting. Lift the lip technique\nshould be done once a month at home to look for early signs of\ntooth decay on the surfaces of upper front teeth.46 level lll\n4. PREVENTION\nThe aims of prevention are targeted at a) early identification of\npatients who are at risk of ECC so that preventive measures\ncan be instituted, b) preventing the progression of dental caries\nin children who are diagnosed with S-ECC and c) preventing\nthe recurrence of dental caries in children who have been\ndiagnosed with severe ECC. The prevention of S-ECC requires a multi-factorial approach\ndue to its various etiological factors as summarized below:\ni.

MANAGEMENT\nThe management of S-ECC is affected by the extent of the\ncarious lesions and the compliance of the child and parent. 5.1\nControl of the Carious Process\nAn individualized caries risk assessment is the first important\nstep in the management of S-ECC. It aims to modify the risk\nfactors as discussed in the previous section. Parents should be asked to wean off the child from using a\nbottle while in bed. In case of considerable emotional\ndependence on the bottle, suggest the use of plain water. In\naddition, parents are instructed to brush child\u2019s teeth last thing\nat night with fluoride toothpaste.49 level I For children aged 3-6\nRECOMMENDATION\n\uf0b7\nMaintenance of good dietary practices, good oral hygiene\ncontrol as well as the use of fluoridated toothpaste are\nrecommended for prevention of ECC\nGrade A\nyears, chair-side topical fluoride varnish (2.2% F) application to\nteeth (Fig 6) should be carried out twice yearly.55 level I\nFig 6.
