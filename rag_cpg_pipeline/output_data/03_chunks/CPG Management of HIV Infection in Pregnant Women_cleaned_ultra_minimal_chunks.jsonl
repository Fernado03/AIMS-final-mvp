The articles were graded using the modified version of those used by the\nCatalonian Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Research\n(CAHTAR) Spain, while the grading of recommendation in these guidelines\nwas modified from the Scottish Intercollegiate guidelines Network (SIGN). The clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of\nthe development group were assigned individual topics within these\nsubgroups. The group members met a total of twenty one times throughout\nthe development of the guideline. All literature retrieved were appraised by\nindividual members and presented and discussed during group meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed by both the\ndevelopment group and review committee. Where the evidence was\ninsufficient the recommendations were derived by consensus of the\ndevelopment group and review committee. The draft guideline was posted on both the Ministry of Health Malaysia and\nAcademy of Medicine, Malaysia websites for comment and feedback. This\nguideline has also been presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for\nClinical Practice Guidelines, and the Health Technology Assessment and\nClinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review\nand approval.

In the absence of any intervention,\nbetween 30% and 45% of children born to HIV positive mothers will become\ninfected with HIV; the lower end of the range applies to higher income country\nsettings, while the upper end of the range applies to lower income, higher\nprevalence settings1\nTransmission is believed to be uncommon during early pregnancy, but the\nrisk increases sharply in late pregnancy and during labour and delivery. Overall, about 15-20% of children who acquire HIV infection from their\nmothers are infected during the antenatal period, 50% during delivery and\n33% through breast feeding.2\nIn June 2001, through its Declaration of Commitment, the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS undertook to\nreduce the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20% by 2005 and by\n50% by 2010, through a four-pronged strategy:\nI. primary prevention of HIV infection in women of reproductive age;\nII. prevention of unintended pregnancy in HIV-positive women;\nIII. prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV by:\na. providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy,\nb. implementing safer delivery practices,\nc. providing counselling and support on infant feeding methods\nIV. provision of care, treatment and support to HIV-infected parents,\ninfants and families. From 1986 till December 2006, there have been 76, 389 cases of HIV\nreported by Ministry of Health (MOH) with 9,155 deaths.3 Although males\naccount for more than 93% of all the HIV infections reported in Malaysia to\ndate, the proportion of new cases among females has increased sharply,\nfrom 1.4% in 2000 and 15% in 2006. Determination of HIV status enables appropriate counselling, timely ARV\ntherapy and management of HIV positive pregnant women to be provided to\nreduce the risk of vertical transmission.4\nThe Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) initiated a National Prevention of\nMother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) Program in 1998. The Program\nis based partly on UNGASS \u201cprong\u201d 2 (i.e. detection of HIV infection during\nthe antenatal period) and more strongly on UNGASS \u201cprong\u201d 3 (i.e. the\nprovision of ARV therapy to mother and baby, safer modes of delivery and\nsafer infant feeding practices for HIV positive mothers (through artificial\nfeeding).", "chunk_order": 6}

Since the introduction of the PMTCT program, a total of 2,925,472 mothers\nwere screened for HIV during antenatal period from 1998 until the end of\n2006 in government facilities. The coverage has been good and for the last\nfive years, increased from 92.8% (2002) to 99.5% (2006). However the\npercentage of HIV positive pregnant women detected was maintained at\nbelow 0.04% (graph below). The vertical transmission rate of HIV from 1998\n\u2013 2006 was 3.8%. (* These data do not include the availability or result of\ntesting in non-government facilities nor the outcomes in HIV infected pregnant\nwomen who do not seek antenatal testing or care). In Malaysia, any woman in whom HIV infection is detected during pregnancy5\nis entitled to free ARV prophylaxis or, if indicated, highly active anti-retroviral\ntherapy (HAART).The dual goals of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in pregnant\nwomen are to provide treatment for the mother and to reduce the likelihood\nof transmission of the virus to the foetus or neonate. In view of increasing numbers of HIV positive women and advancements in\nmanagement, this guideline will facilitate the care of these women by\ndisseminating relevant and contemporary information to all levels of health\ncare workers in a systematic fashion. *In 2006, the outcome of only 62 babies out of the 170 positive pregnant women is\npresently known.

There is no evidence at which viral load\ntransmission occurs.9,Level 1\nBased on 13 cohort studies the risk of vertical transmission without ARV\ntreatment was estimated to be about 15 to 30% worldwide.4 Level 1 As\nmaternal health plays an important role in reducing perinatal transmission,\nthe strategy to improve HIV-related care for HIV-infected women is crucial\nto reduce HIV infection in children. The most important obstetric factors that influence the transmission rate are\nduration of membrane rupture and mode of delivery. Invasive monitoring,\ninstrumental delivery and prematurity have also been shown to increase the\nrate of perinatal transmission.10, Level 9 Studies in twins suggest that the first\nborn twin is at higher risk of transmission than the second born. This supports\nthe evidence that the presence of virus in the genital tract influences vertical\ntransmission.11, Level 8\nAny invasive procedure (e.g. amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling) for\nprenatal diagnosis is not recommended unless the potential benefits outweigh\nthe risks.10,Level 9;12 ,Level 9\nRecommendation for reducing risk of transmission\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 Invasive procedures (e.g. amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling)\nin HIV pregnant women are not recommended (Grade C)\n3.0\nSCREENING\n3.1\nCounselling\nGroup pre-test counselling has been advocated during booking to shorten\ncounselling time.1,Level 8 This is followed by individual pre-test counselling to\nscreen-positive pregnant women to enable them to give informed consent\nfor confirmatory testing. Post-test counselling is provided to ensure these women receive appropriate\ntreatment.14, Level 8 The testing-result interval should be as short as possible.15, Level 9\nThere remains general consensus that HIV testing should be voluntary and\nperformed after obtaining informed consent.9,Level 1;16,Level 2. Women are much\nmore likely to get tested if they perceive their provider strongly recommends\nHIV testing.17 ,Level 3\nA meta-analysis of 27 studies concluded that HIV counselling and testing\nwas an effective intervention for HIV positive participants.

This is because some women seroconvert during pregnancy after\nfirst antenatal check-up. This test should be performed between 3 to 18\nweeks after the initial test. 22, Level 9\nHigh risk factors include:\n\u2022 Women whose past or present sexual partners were HIV infected,\nbisexual or IVDU 9, Level 1\n\u2022 Women seeking treatment for sexually transmitted disease (STD)\n9,Level 1\n\u2022 Commercial sex worker9,Level 1\n\u2022 Women with past or present history of intravenous drug use\n(IVDU)9 ,Level 1\n\u2022 Women with history of blood transfusion before 1986\n\u2022 Unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with more than one sex\npartner23,Level 9\n3.4\nMethods of HIV testing\nThe standard diagnostic testing for HIV infection in adults also applies to\nHIV testing of pregnant women. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA), in combination with a confirmatory Western\nBlot is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for determining HIV infection. Together,\nthese two tests have a sensitivity and specificity greater than 99%. 9 , Level 1\nHowever in the WHO HIV testing strategy, a reactive Enzyme Linked\nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA) / Enzyme Immuno Assay (EIA) result is\nfollowed by Particle Agglutination (PA).

This benefit appears additive with prophylactic ZDV monotherapy and\nthe likelihood of transmission was reduced by approximately 87% with both\nelective caesarean section and full-course ZDV compared to other modes\nof delivery.38,Level 9; 50, Level 1; 75, Level 1\nIn a meta-analysis of 7 prospective studies of women with viral loads < 1000\ncopies /mL at delivery or at the measurement closest to delivery, there was\na 1% risk of transmission rate for those on ARV, compared with 9.8% for\nuntreated mothers. Elective LSCS has been shown to further reduce\ntransmission rates. 86 ,Level 1\nWomen who have a detectable viral load and / or who are not taking HAART\nshould be offered an elective caesarean section as it reduces MTCT. It is\nrecommended that delivery by elective caesarean section should take place\nafter 38 weeks of gestation. 10, Level 9\nIncreasing geometric levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA were associated with\nincreasing rates of transmission. The highest transmission rate was among\nwomen whose plasma HIV-1 RNA levels exceeded 100,000 copies who had\n7.2\nManagement of ruptured membranes\nA cohort of 525 women infected with HIV-1 demonstrated that ruptured\nmembranes for > 4 hours and mean CD4+ count < 29% (CD4 count < 500\ncells/uL) were significantly associated with higher risk of MTCT.92, Level 6\nIn a metanalysis of 15 prospective cohort studies, the risk of vertical\ntransmission increases approximately 2% with an increase of every hour in\nduration of ruptured membranes. The estimated probability of transmission\nincreased from 8% to 31% with duration of ruptured membranes of 2 and 24\nhours respectively.93, Level 1\nTo reduce the risk of MTCT, caesarean section should be performed within\n4 hours of membrane rupture (with the exception of women stable on HAART\nwith viral load <1000 at 34-36 weeks\u2019). 94 Level 9; 10,Level 9\nRecommendation for management of ruptured membranes\n\u2022 The duration of ruptured membranes increases the risk of\nperinatal transmission (Grade A) therefore Caesarean section is\nof doubtful benefit after 4 hours of membrane rupture.
