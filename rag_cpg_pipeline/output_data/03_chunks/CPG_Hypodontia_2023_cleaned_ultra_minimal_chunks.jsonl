They are intended as a guide for the best clinical practice in\nthe management of hypodontia presently. However, it must be noted\nthat adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to the best\nclinical outcome in individual patient care, as every health care provider\nis responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on\nthe clinical presentation and management options available locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in November 2023 and will be reviewed\nin 2027 or earlier if important new evidence becomes available. When\nit is due for updating, the head of the related specialty will be informed\nabout it. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will be\ndone on the need for a revision including the scope of the revised clinical\npractice guidelines (CPG). The systematic review methodology used by\nthe Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be\nemployed in reviewing the guidelines. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

Management of Hypodontia (Second Edition)\nv\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThese clinical practice guidelines (CPG) were developed by a\nmultidisciplinary expert committee consisting of Orthodontic Specialists,\na Paediatric Dental Specialist, a Restorative Dental Specialist, a Dental\nPublic Health Specialist, Dental Officers and a Dental Therapist mainly\nfrom the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Higher Education and private\nsector. The previous edition of the CPG on Orthodontic Management of\nDevelopmentally Missing Incisors (2012) was used as the basis for\nthe development of these guidelines. The recommendations were\nformulated by taking into consideration the best available evidence and\nlocal practices. Several improvements have been introduced in this\nedition. The scope has been expanded to include new and updated\ninformation. In addition, clinical audit indicators have also been identified\nfor the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic\nReviews (CDSR) and Embase while full text journal articles were\nretrieved from these databases. The literature search was limited to\nhuman study, English language and published articles from 2012 to\nMarch 2023. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. An example of the search strategy used can be found in Appendix 1. Details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the\nCPG Secretariat. There were eleven (11) clinical questions which were assigned to\nmembers of the development group. The group members met a total of\n12 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All retrieved\narticles were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme\n(CASP) checklist by at least two members, presented in the form of\nevidence tables and discussed during group meetings.

INTRODUCTION\nHypodontia is a condition characterised by the congenital absence of\none or more teeth.(1) It is also known as \u201ccongenital tooth agenesis\u201d,\nspecifically defined by the terms hypodontia, oligodontia and anodontia. According to The International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision\n(ICD-11), hypodontia is defined as congenital agenesis of less than 6\nteeth, oligodontia is when 6 or more teeth are missing and anodontia is\nwhen agenesis of all teeth, excluding third molars.(2)\nIt is a relatively common developmental anomaly that affects globally\nwith prevalence of 6.4% (95% CI 5.7 to 7.2%) and 6.3% in Asia (95%\nCI 4.4 to 9.1%).(3) level II-2 However, prevalence among the Malaysian\npopulation was 1%.(4) level III This condition can occur in both deciduous\nand permanent dentitions and the most commonly affected teeth are\nthe permanent incisors and premolars. The aetiology of congenital\ntooth agenesis is multifactorial. Hypodontia has unfavorable implications on dental and facial\ndevelopment particularly on functional and aesthetic outcomes. It can\nlead to problems with speech, mastication and self-esteem which may\nrequire complex and costly dental treatments. Patients may present\nwith varying degrees of severity, prompting them to seek possible\ntreatment. Hypodontia has been shown to have an impact on the oral\nhealth and well-being of individuals. Early intervention and/or interceptive management can reduce the\nseverity of malocclusion and preserve dental structures necessary for\nrestorative/prosthesis procedures later.(5) Treatment approach whether\nto open or close space for the replacement of the missing tooth\ndepends on various parameters involving dento-skeletal profile, type\nof malocclusion, space availability, age and cooperation of the patient,\nperiodontal health as well as financial issues. Hypodontia patients may require a multidisciplinary treatment approach\ninvolving orthodontist, paediatric dental specialist, restorative dental\nspecialist and other dental specialties.", "chunk_order": 7}

It is anticipated that this new CPG\nwill serve as a valuable resource for healthcare providers at all levels\nof care, enabling them to effectively manage patients with hypodontia. Management of Hypodontia (Second Edition)\nThis CPG is also essential to create awareness and knowledge among\npatients and guardians. In this edition of CPG, more clinical questions were added to address the\nadvances in the management of hypodontia, and its scope broadened,\nto include all permanent teeth rather than confining to missing incisors.

AETIOLOGY\nTooth agenesis is one of the most common dental anomalies which\ncan occur in syndromic (e.g. ectodermal dysplasia, Down\u2019s syndrome\nand hemifacial microsomia) or non-syndromic conditions (e.g. cleft\nlip and palate). Multiple theories and evidences demonstrate that the\ndevelopment of tooth agenesis is linked to genetic and environmental\nfactors.(6)\n3.1\nGenetic Factors\nTooth agenesis is closely related to cellular-level issues involving\npathogenic variants of certain genes, which is the protein product\nin craniofacial and tooth development. To date, mutated genes\nhave been identified related to tooth agenesis. These genes can be\ninherited through either paternal or maternal transmission in complete\npenetrance.", "chunk_order": 8}

(23) When an unerupted tooth is not palpable, hypodontia should be\nsuspected and diagnosis can be confirmed with dental radiographs. These radiographs are indicated to be taken at the time of early mixed\ndentition to provide diagnostic information concerning hypodontia.(23)\nRadiographic examination is often necessary to make a conclusive\ndiagnosis of hypodontia, but caution must be taken to avoid taking\nradiographs too early. This is because the development of some\npermanent teeth such as the second premolars may not begin until a\nchild is 9 to 10 years old. Therefore, waiting until a child is over 9 years\nof age before taking a dental panoramic radiograph for the diagnosis of\nhypodontia is essential.(5)\nA recent systematic review of healthy children and adolescents revealed\nthat out of 123 articles reporting various dental anomalies, 44 articles\nreported hypodontia.

With recent technological advancements, 3D scanners may\nbe incorporated for digital treatment planning. However, in growing hypodontia patients, the provision of\ncomprehensive treatment related to prosthetic replacements (e.g. implant and bridges) may be delayed. 6.1\nConservative Treatment\nConservative treatment is an option in hypodontia if the occlusion is\nacceptable and the patient is satisfied with the dentition and not willing\nto commit to lengthy and costly treatment. This includes preservation\nof deciduous teeth with continuous monitoring. Preservation of\ndeciduous teeth in hypodontia patients refers to the process of\nmaintaining them in place and may involve various treatment options\nsuch as fillings, crowns and root canal therapy to ensure their longevity\nuntil exfoliated. A recent systematic review comprising three observational studies\nassessing survival rate of deciduous molars with agenesis of\npremolars showed 82% to 89% of the retained molars were in good\ncondition over a follow-up ranging from 5 to 13 years. However, all the\nthree studies were of low certainty.(29) level II-2\nIn two retrospective studies analysing retained deciduous teeth with\nthe same cohort of severe hypodontia patients showed, the tooth\ntypes with the highest tendency to remain in good condition were\nmandibular deciduous canine (64.3%) and second deciduous molar\n(35.7%) at 12 years follow up.

This monitoring plays an important role\nin preserving the alveolar bone and the remaining teeth, as to ensure\noptimal prognosis of retained deciduous teeth.

Figure 7: A case of retained deciduous tooth\nManagement of Hypodontia (Second Edition)\nRecommendation 5\nPreservation of deciduous teeth may be considered as an option in\nindividuals with hypodontia. 6.2\nInterceptive Treatment\nInterceptive treatment of hypodontia in early mixed dentition prevents\nthe development of malocclusion and complications in the permanent\ndentition, eventually reducing or eliminating the need for complex\ntreatment. In cases of missing maxillary permanent lateral incisor,\nearly extraction of deciduous incisor or canine may prevent impaction\nand allow eruption of permanent canine into the lateral incisor position. (34) Extraction of deciduous teeth when permanent successors are\nmissing, constitutes an active treatment modality. A recent Cochrane Review assessed the effectiveness of extraction of\nthe primary teeth to promote the eruption of palatally displaced canine\n(PDC) among 9 to 14 years old patients.(35) level I\n\u2022 An RCT found extracting the primary canine may increase the\nproportion of PDCs that successfully erupt into the mouth at 12\nmonths compared with no extraction (RR=2.87, 95% CI 0.90 to 9.23). However, statistically there was no significant difference between the\ngroups. \u2022 Three RCTs comparing single versus double primary teeth extraction\nfound no significant difference between the two groups in terms of\neruption of PDC at 18 months. However, at 48 months, 2 out of 3\nRCTs showed significantly higher eruption of the PDC when double,\ncompared to a single primary tooth, was extracted (RR=1.28, 95% CI\n1.06 to 1.54). Despite the low risk of bias of the included RCTs, the certainty of the\nevidence was very low. A retrospective study evaluating the prognosis of retained deciduous\nmandibular molars without successors showed significant correlation\nbetween root resorption and infraocclusion (mesial root r=0.37;\np=0.001; distal root r=0.29; p=0.006).(30) level II-2 As the severity of root\nresorption increases, the likelihood of infraocclusion also tends to\nincrease. Thus, in the presence of infraocclusion, extraction of the\ndeciduous teeth is advisable. Interceptive treatment is an integral part of the overall management of\nhypodontia as it is sufficient to obtain a partial result, while establishing\nthe pre-requirements for normal growth. The prognosis of retained\ndeciduous teeth is determined based on clinical and radiographic\nexamination of the alveolar, crown and root.(36)\nManagement of Hypodontia (Second Edition)\nA multidisciplinary team approach is needed when deciding on\nextracting retained deciduous teeth in congenitally missing permanent\ndentition.", "chunk_order": 17}

Orthodontic retainers can be categorised into removable and fixed\nretainers. Removable retainers can be removed by the patient for\ncleaning and eating and are worn as prescribed by the clinician. Fixed\nretainers (bonded retainers) are typically bonded to the lingual or\npalatal surface of the teeth and cannot be removed by the patient. Both types of retainers have their advantages and disadvantages, and\nthe choice between them often depends on the patient's individual\nneeds and preferences. 7.1\nRemovable Retainer\nRemovable retainers which are most commonly used are Hawley and\nvacuum-formed retainers. Vacuum-formed retainers are also known\nas thermoplastic or Essix retainers.

Even though removable retainers had small statistical differences in\nthe alignment of both arches, it is not clinically significant. Dual retention, which is a fixed retainer combined with removable\nretainer worn at night, is usually indicated for high relapse tendency\namong hypodontia patients. Due to a lack of sufficient evidence-based studies on orthodontic\nretention, expert opinions and clinical evidence are often relied upon\nto determine the best long-term maintenance for treatment results. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to assess each individual\npatient with hypodontia to determine types of retention.
