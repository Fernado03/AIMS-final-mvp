Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were issued in 2015 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2019) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

There was active involvement of a\nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. A literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N); Medline via Ovid,\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and CINAHL via\nEBSCOhost (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria are all literature on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)\nregardless of study design although emphasis was put for systematic\nreview. The search was limited to literature published in the last 20\nyears, humans, \u201call child\u201d (0 to 18 years) and English. In addition, the\nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to\nfurther identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted\nto identify relevant studies. In certain situations, pivotal papers beyond\nthe scope of search were used in the CPG. All searches were conducted\nfrom 23 January 2014 to 20 May 2015. Literature searches were\nrepeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development\nprocess allowing any relevant papers published before 31 August 2015\nto be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published\nafter this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to a CPG entitled Pediatric Diabetes\ndeveloped by International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent\nDiabetes (ISPAD) in 2014. The CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal\nof Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them\nbeing used as references. A total of 15 main clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions).

The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nManagement of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Children & Adolescents\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence, while the\ngrading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE\n(refer to the preceding page). On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and\nCPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is the most common type of diabetes\nmellitus in children and adolescents. The incidence of T1DM is very\nlow in Asia, which is approximately 2 to 5 per 100,000 person-years.1 -\n3, level II-2 In Malaysia, the incidence of T1DM was not reported by the\nMalaysian Diabetes in Children and Adolescents Registry (DiCARE)\n2006 - 2008 report due to several limitations. There were 34 sites that\nreported 408 patients to DiCARE from 2006 - 2008. Among children\nand adolescents under the age of 20 years with diabetes mellitus,\n71.8% were diagnosed with T1DM. The median age of diagnosis was\n7.6 (IQR 4.6, 10.8) years and majority (58.3%) presented with diabetic\nketoacidosis (DKA).4, level III However, the sample size of DiCARE was\nsmall and could not represent the population. T1DM is a chronic disease which is associated with various complications\nincluding retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and cardiovascular\nmorbidity. Studies have shown that good glycaemic control early in the\ndisease results in lower frequency of chronic diabetes complications. In\norder to reduce health care cost due to the complications, appropriate\ntreatment should be started early. Accurate classification of diabetes\nand proper management of these children to achieve glycaemic target\nis of utmost importance. DiCARE reported a mean HbA1c of 10.8%\nreflecting poor metabolic control.4, level III\nTherefore, these clinical practice guidelines aim to provide evidencebased guidance to those who are involved in the management of\nchildren and adolescents with T1DM. 2. DIAGNOSIS\nTIDM is primarily due to pancreatic islet \u03b2-cell destruction leading\nto severe insulin deficiency and manifested by low or undetectable\nplasma concentration of C-peptide. Markers of the immune-mediated\n\u03b2-cell destruction process include glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)\nantibody, insulin autoantibodies (IAA), anti-islet antibody (ICA), protein\nthyrosine phosphatase antibody (ICA512 or IA2A) and zinc transporter\n8 (ZnT8).5, level III More than 90% of patients with newly diagnosed\nT1DM have more than one of these autoantibodies. T1DM patients\nwith absence of islet \u03b2-cell antibody or so called type 1B diabetes\nhave no evidence of \u03b2-cell autoimmunity.", "chunk_order": 5}

However, patients with false\nnegative antibodies can be due to diminished titre over the course of\nthe disease.6, level III\nThe diagnosis of diabetes mellitus should be made based on the\npresence or absence of symptoms and biochemical criteria according\nManagement of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Children & Adolescents\nto World Health Organization Diagnostic Criteria (1999). Diagnosis of\ndiabetes can be made when:7, level III\n1. classic symptoms and signs are present and\n2. fasting venous plasma glucose concentration is \u22657.0 mmol/L, and/or\nthe random venous plasma glucose concentration \u226511.1 mmol/L\nThe diagnosis must be confirmed by repeat blood glucose testing in the\nabsence of unequivocal hyperglycaemia. Patients with T1DM can present acutely with severe symptoms, and\nfrequently with ketoacidosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed quickly\nwith blood glucose (BG) value without waiting for another day as urgent\ntreatment is needed. In the presence of mild symptoms, the diagnosis of diabetes should\nnever be made on a single abnormal BG value. Oral glucose tolerance\ntest (OGTT) is rarely required, except in very early disease, in which\nmost BG values are normal and the diagnosis of diabetes is uncertain. The role of HbA1c alone in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus remains\nunclear and diabetes cannot be excluded when the value is <6.5%.8\nBlood investigations that reflect \u03b2-cell function and immune-mediated\n\u03b2-cell destruction can be used to identify the aetiology and type of\ndiabetes.7, level III Additional support for the diagnosis of T1DM include:\n9, level III\ni. low or undetectable C-peptide levels\nii. presence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies (GAD/IAA/\nICA512/IA2/ZnT8)\nManagement of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Children & Adolescents\n\u2022 Diagnostic criteria of diabetes mellitus:7, level III\ni. classic symptomsa of diabetes or hyperglycaemic crisis, with\nplasma glucose concentration \u226511.1 mmol/L\nOR\nii. fasting plasma glucoseb \u22657.0 mmol/L\nOR\niii. two hour post-load glucose \u226511.1 mmol/L in OGTTc\nOR\niv.", "chunk_order": 6}

If no improvement is seen in pH, anion gap or \u03b2-OHB\nconcentration, reassess the patient, review insulin therapy and consider\nother possible causes of impaired response to insulin such as infection\nor errors in insulin preparation. For patients with marked sensitivity to\ninsulin (e.g. young children with DKA), the dose may be decreased\nprovided that metabolic acidosis continues to resolve.8\nDuration and dose of insulin infusion should be kept in the lower range\nto avoid severe hypokalaemia as insulin has an aldosterone-like effect\nleading to increased urinary potassium excretion.8\n\u2022 Adjustment of glucose administration:8\n\uf0a1 BG level typically decreases at a rate of 2 - 5 mmol/L/hour,\ndepending on the timing and amount of glucose administration. \uf0a1 When BG falls to approximately 14 - 17 mmol/L, 5% glucose\nshould be added to the IV fluid. \uf0a1 If BG falls very rapidly (>5 mmol/L/hour) after initial fluid expansion,\nconsider adding glucose even before BG has decreased to 17 mmol/L. \uf0a1 While correcting metabolic acidosis with insulin infusion, 10% or\neven 12.5% dextrose may be needed to prevent hypoglycaemia.

Detailed record of SMBG, carbohydrate intake and\ninsulin doses are crucial when making insulin dose adjustments.83, level III\n8.1 Insulin to Carbohydrate Ratio\n\u2022 ICR is defined as the amount of carbohydrate in gramme covered\nby one unit (IU) of rapid-acting or short-acting insulin. \u2022 It can be calculated by using the 500 (for rapid-acting insulin)\n8; 83, level III and 450 (for short-acting insulin)84, level III rules. \u2022 ICR for most children are 1:20 or 1:25.83, level III However in practice,\nadolescents may require more insulin and thus giving a higher ICR\n(e.g. 1:15). ICR is often higher for breakfast due to higher insulin\nresistance. \u2022 For very young children requiring <10 IU of insulin per day, the 300\n- 450 rule may be used.83, level III\n\u2022 The 500 rule for rapid-acting insulin:\nICR\n=\n500\nTotal daily insulin*\n*basal and bolus insulin\nFor example, a child requires 6 IU of rapid-acting insulin for breakfast,\nlunch and dinner, and 12 IU of basal insulin. The total daily insulin dose\nis 30 IU (6 IU + 6 IU + 6 IU +12 IU) and the ICR is 16.7 g/IU (500\ndivided by 30 IU). Therefore, every 16.7 g of carbohydrate consumed\nwill require 1 IU of rapid-acting insulin. \u2022 The 450 rule for short-acting insulin:\nICR\n=\n450\nTotal daily insulin*\n*basal and bolus insulin\n\u2022 Alternatively, ICR for individual meal can be calculated by dividing\nthe carbohydrate content in gramme by the insulin dose in IU.

Check BG\nafter 10 - 15 minutes and repeat oral glucose administration if there\nis no improvement. Thereafter, complex carbohydrates in the form\nof fruit, bread, cereal or milk can be consumed to prevent recurrent\nhypoglycaemia. Patients should carry with them a hypokit consisting of glucose sachet\nor glucose tablet and a serving of complex carbohydrates such as\nbiscuits.

Management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Children & Adolescents\n12. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (EXERCISE)\nPhysical activity is an essential component in the management of\nT1DM. Diabetic patients have higher risk of developing cardiovascular\ndisease.105 It is important for the patients to engage in regular physical\nactivity, together with insulin therapy and dietary adjustment. Physical activity (exercise) can be divided into types:8\ni. Aerobic (cardiovascular) exercise is a low intensity physical activity\nthat depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process\nand the use of oxygen adequately to meet energy demands. Examples of aerobic/cardiovascular exercise are medium to long\ndistance running/jogging, swimming, cycling, and walking. Aerobic exercise tends to lower BG level both during (usually within\n20 - 60 minutes from the start of exercise) and after the exercise. ii. Anaerobic exercise is a high intensity physical activity. It is intense\nenough to trigger lactate formation and performed in excess of 90%\nmaximum heart rate. Examples include weight training, sprinting\nand burst training. Although anaerobic exercise last only a short time (sometimes only\nseconds), it may increase the BG level dramatically due to the release\nof the hormones epinephrine and glucagon. This rise in BG is usually\ntransient, lasting typically 30 - 60 minutes, and may be followed by\nhypoglycaemia a few hours after the exercise ends.", "chunk_order": 33}

During this period, one has to abstain from\neating and drinking. Islam has allowed various categories of people\nto be exempted from fasting, for example young children, sick people\nand travellers. Major risks associated with fasting in diabetic patients\ninclude hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, DKA, dehydration and\nthrombosis. Nevertheless, many patients with T1DM insist on fasting\nduring Ramadan. Those who intend to fast should have good glycaemic\ncontrol, perform regular self-monitoring and be under professional\nsupervision.

The group that developed microalbuminuria had a higher\nHbA1c (9.1%); median diabetes duration at the onset of persistent\nmicroalbuminuria was 9.3 years and the earliest case was 1.6 years\nafter diagnosis of diabetes.126, level II-3\nRisk factors for microalbuminuria are:127, level III\n\u2022 hypertension (p=0.001)\n\u2022 higher HbA1c levels (p=0.001)\n\u2022 longer diabetes duration (p=0.036)\n\u2022 dyslipidaemia (p=0.034)\nThe first clinical sign of nephropathy is elevation of albumin excretion. This is generally defined as any of those below:8\ni. AER of 20 - 200 \u03bcg/min\nii. AER of 30 - 300 mg/24 hours\niii. albumin concentration of 30 - 300 mg/L (early morning urine sample)\niv.", "chunk_order": 48}

Abnormal screening tests should be repeated as\nmicroalbuminuria may not be persistent.8\nWhen interpreting urine microalbuminuria, false positive results should\nbe considered which may occur in the following conditions:8\n\u2022 exercise\n\u2022 menstrual bleeding\n\u2022 infections\n\u2022 fever\n\u2022 kidney diseases\n\u2022 marked hyperglycaemia\nACEi or ARB should be used in adolescent patients with persistent\nmicroalbuminuria to prevent progression to proteinuria. An important\nsafety issue related to the use of both medications is the potential risk\nof congenital malformation when used during pregnancy. Therefore,\nadolescent girls need to be informed about this risk and advised on\ncontraception before starting medication.8 Patients with transient\nmicroalbuminuria generally do not need to be treated with ACEi or ARB. Management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Children & Adolescents\n16.2 Retinopathy\nAssessment for retinopathy in patients with T1DM should be performed\nby an ophthalmologist or any trained healthcare provider through\ndilated pupils. Initial eye examination should also be considered to\ndetect major refractive errors or cataracts. The frequency of retinopathy\nscreening in general should be done annually and more frequently if\nthere are high risk features for visual loss. Biennial assessment by\nfundal photography should be performed for those with:8\n\u2022 diabetes duration <10 years\n\u2022 minimal background retinopathy on fundus photography\n\u2022 reasonable glycaemic control\nThe prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is higher in pubertal than in prepubertal patients, for any grade of diabetic retinopathy (p=0.002).129, level III\nAt 10 years follow-up in EDIC study, adults in the former intensive group\ncontinued to show slower progression of diabetic retinopathy than those\nin the conventional group (hazard reduction of 56%, p<0.0001). However,\nthis beneficial effect was not seen in adolescents (hazard reduction of\n32%, p=0.13).68, level II-2\n16.3 Neuropathy\nBased on nerve conduction study, 57% of children with a mean\ndiabetes duration of 8.1+2.6 years and a mean HbA1c of 9.0+1.0% had\ndiabetic neuropathy.

Dyslipidaemia\nYoung patients with T1DM demonstrate significantly higher levels of\ntotal cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein B\ncompared to non-diabetics.134, level III\nScreening for dyslipidaemia should be done soon after diagnosis in\nall children with T1DM aged >10 years old. If the result is normal, it\nshould be repeated every five years. In those with strong family history\nof hypercholesterolaemia, premature cardiovascular disease or if the\nfamily history is unknown, screening should be performed as early as\ntwo years old.8 Refer to Table 9. If the LDL is high (>2.6 mmol/L), intervention to improve metabolic\ncontrol, dietary changes and exercise should be emphasised. Although\nlong-term safety is not established, statin should be considered in\nchildren >10 years old if LDL is >4.1 mmol/L (or >3.4 mmol/L if one\nor more cardiovascular risk factors is present) despite the above\ninterventions.8\nRecommendation 24\n\u2022 Lipid profile should be screened every five years in patients with\ntype 1 diabetes mellitus aged >10 years old or at an earlier age\nif there is family history of premature cardiovascular disease or\nhypercholestrolaemia. ii.

Pre-hypertension is defined as BP that is between\n90thand 95th percentile.8\nManagement of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Children & Adolescents\nThe prevalence of hypertension in young patients with T1DM based\non ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is 28.4%.135, level III In a study\non patients with average HbA1c between 6.5 to 10.7%, the cumulative\nmortality rate was 35% in adulthood from coronary artery disease\ncompared with 4 - 8% in the general population. Female adolescents\nand young adults with T1DM have more centrally distributed fat than\nmale which increases their cardiovascular risk.136, level III ACEi are\nrecommended for use in children with diabetes and hypertension. They\nhave been shown to be effective and safe in children in short-term\nstudies but are not safe during pregnancy.8\nBP should be measured with an appropriate cuff at least annually in\npatients with T1DM. Refer to Table 9. Recommendation 25\n\u2022 Blood pressure should be measured at least annually in patients\nwith type 1 diabetes mellitus. iii. Limited joint mobility\nLimited joint mobility (LJM) is a bilateral painless contracture of the\nfinger joints and large joints, and associated with tight skin. It can be\ndemonstrated by asking the patient to approximate palmar surfaces of\nthe interphalangeal joints. Passive examination is essential to confirm\nthat inability to do so is due to LJM. This deformity usually appears\nafter the age of 10 years. The progression from mild to moderate or\nsevere changes ranges from a few months to four years, following\nwhich stabilisation occurs. For every unit increase in average HbA1c,\nthere is an approximately 46% increase risk of developing LJM. LJM is\nassociated with a two- to four-fold risk for retinopathy, nephropathy and\nneuropathy.8\niv. Lipodystrophy (lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy)\nLipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of insulin therapy. It has\nbeen found up to 48% in those with T1DM and is associated with higher\nHbA1c, greater number of injections and longer duration of diabetes. The lesion can be detected by both visualisation and palpation of the\ninjecting sites. The affected site cannot be pinched tightly together in\ncontrast to normal skin. The independent risk factors for lipohypertrophy\nare:8\n\u2022 lack of rotation in injection sites\n\u2022 use of small injection zones\n\u2022 reuse of needles\nInsulin may be absorbed unpredictably from these areas, affecting\nBG control.

REFERRAL\nThe ongoing care of children and adolescents with T1DM requires\nthe care of a specialised diabetes team consists of paediatric\nendocrinologists, paediatricians, paediatric diabetes nurses, dietitians,\npsychologists/psychiatrists\nand\noften\nconsultations\nwith\nthe\nophthalmologists. In hospitals without these services, paediatric\nendocrine specialists can provide consultation at intervals to guide the\nmanagement of complicated cases. The recommendations for referral\nto paediatric endocrine service below are formulated based on the\nexpert opinion of the DG CPG. Recommendation 26\n\u2022 Referral of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus\nto paediatric endocrinologists should be made in the following\nconditions:\n\uf0a1 uncertainty with classification of diabetes\n\uf0a1 difficult metabolic control\n\uf0a1 concomitant co-morbidities and other management issues\n\uf0a1 inadequate resources and expertise in management\n18. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nIt is important to standardise the management of T1DM at all healthcare\nlevels in Malaysia by using an evidence-based CPG. This aims to prevent\nlong-term morbidity and mortality. a.
