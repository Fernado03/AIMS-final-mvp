There are many causes for elevated cell\ncounts and one of them is chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). It is important not\nto miss the diagnosis of MPD because of the thrombotic and bleeding complications that\nare not uncommonly seen as well as the small risk of leukaemic transformation. As the diagnosis of MPD is one of exclusion, a guideline is urgently needed to assist clinicians\nand haematologists alike in making a definitive diagnosis. With the development of this guideline, we hope to create a better understanding of the\nMPDs among physicians such that appropriate management and referral to the haematologists\nare undertaken. Jameela Sathar\nPresident\nMalaysian MPD Group\nDiagnosis and Management Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders\nGUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nChronic Myeloproliferative Disorders (MPD) are a closely related group of haematologic\ndisorders in which there is inappropriate proliferation of myeloid precursors in the bone\nmarrow. The MPDs are further classified into four groups: Polycythaemia Rubra Vera(PRV),\nEssential Thrombocythaemia(ET), Myelofibrosis with Myeloid Metaplasia(MMM) and the\nunclassified MPDs. There is no specific test to diagnose MPD; the diagnosis is one of exclusion. It is important\nnot to miss the diagnosis as delay in treatment may lead to thrombotic complications with\nincreased morbidity and mortality. The clinical practice guideline on \u201c Diagnosis & Management of Myeloproliferative\nDisorders in Malaysia\u201d was prepared by a group of haematologists based on a systematic\nreview of evidence and clinical practices. The Malaysian MPD group is affiliated to the\nAsia Pacific MPD Study Group comprising countries from Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong,\nSingapore, Australia, Thailand and Indonesia. Objectives\nThe aim of the guideline is to provide diagnostic criteria and proper management for patients\nwith MPD.

Diagnosis and Management Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders\nDESIGN AND METHODS. -\nThe Malaysian MPD Group consisting of Consultant Haematologists from both\nteaching and government institutions & hospitals systematically reviewed the\npublished literature from 1980 to August 2002. -\nFrom September 2002 to Dec 2004, four Consensus Discussion Group were held\nwith the goal of solving residual disagreement on recommendations. -\nThe drafted guidelines were then sent to an expert panel consisting of senior\nHaematologists. -\nSystematic review of clinical evidence: a list of clinical papers were made available\nto the expert panel for review and a consensus was reached by the panel of expert. A\nsearch was done for Myeloproliferative Diseases, Essential Thrombocythaemia,\nThrombocythaemia, Thrombocytosis, Erythrocytosis, Polycythaemia Vera,\nPolycythaemia Rubra Vera, Polycythaemia, Myelofibrosis and Myeloid Metaplasia\nwith Myelofibrosis in the following journals :\no\nNEJM\no\nPUB-Med\no\nBlood\no\nAnnals of Haematology\no\nEuropean Journal of Haematology\no\nAmerican Journal of Haematology\no\nBritish Medical Journal\no\nJournal of Clinical Oncology\no\nLeukemia\no\nCancer\no\nLeukemiaLymphoma\nResults. The Malaysian MPD Group provided recommendations on when to start plateletlowering therapy, the most appropriate platelet-lowering agent, the use of anti-platelet\ntherapy, and the management in women of childbearing age and pregnant women. The\nmanagement includes risk stratification, therapy options, efficacy & side-effects of various\ndrugs. Conclusions. By using evidence and consensus, recommendations for the treatment of key\nproblems in MPDs have been agreed upon. The guideline is then drafted according to the\nstrength of the supporting evidence and uncertainty is explicitly declared.

The current classification of the MPD includes the following:\nPolycythaemia rubra vera (PRV)\nEssential thrombocythaemia (ET)\nMyelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM)\nUnclassified\nThese four disorders are considered separate from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and\nthe myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with variable propensity to evolve into acute\nleukaemia.

PRV and ET are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) had been traditionally considered as part of chronic\nmyeloproliferative disorder. As the emphasis on Philadelphia Chromosome became more\nprominent, CML evolved into its own entity defined by the translocation t(9:22) whereas\nthe remaining disorders not associated with the translocation remain as part of MPD. The combined overall incidence of MPD is 100-150 cases/year/million population in Europe. The respective incidences of PRV, ET, MMM are approximately 2.3, 2.5 and 1.3 per 100,000\npopulation1 . Median age at diagnosis is similar among the MPD, about 60 years. There is a\nslight preponderance of males in PRV and MMM and of females in ET. Diagnosis and Management Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders\nPOLYCYTHAEMIA RUBRA VERA (PRV)2\nDefinition\nPolycythaemia (erythrocytosis) is defined as an increase in haemoglobin concentration above\nnormal i.e.[raised packed cell volume (PCV) in male>0.51 and female>0.48]. True\npolycythaemia exists when the total red cell mass(RCM), measured by dilutional method\nwith radio-isotopic red cells, is increased above normal. Spurious or relative (pseudo or\nstress) polycythaemia exists when an elevated haemoglobin concentration is caused by a\nreduction in plasma volume as measured by dilutional method with radio-isotopically labeled\nalbumin (Figure below).

Erythrocytosis is independent of\nerythropoietin (EPO) with presence of the intact structure and function of EPO. EPOindependent erythroid viability in PRV may be facilitated by an abnormal expression of\napoptosis-inhibiting oncoproteins or augmented stimulatory signal transduction as evidence\nby hypersensitivity of some erythroid progenitors to a variety of cytokines, including insulinlike and myeloid growth factors (stem cell factors, granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating\nfactor, interleukin-3).

In\nnearly 25% of patients, an episode of venous or arterial thrombosis, such as deep vein\nthrombosis, myocardial ischaemia or stroke, is the first manifestation. Mesenteric and portal\nor splenic vein thrombosis should always lead to consideration of PRV as a possible cause,\nand may even precede the onset of an overt polycythaemic stage. Vasomotor symptoms\nsuch as headache, dizziness, visual disturbances and paresthesias are also major complaints. Other findings may include pruritus, erythromelalgia and gout. Haemorrhage, particularly\nfrom the gastrointestinal tract, may also occur. Physical findings include phlethora in 70% of patients, palpable splenomegaly in 70%, and\nhepatomegaly in 40%. Prognosis4\nAge and the history of previous thrombosis are the most powerful predictors of recurrent\nthrombosis. Patients with PRV and ET may be stratified into defined risk groups that are\nmanaged differently. (Table 2)\nTable 2.

Pathogenesis\nX-linked enzyme and genetic analysis have shown that patients with ET have clonal\nhaematopoeisis that originates in stem cells. Serum thrombopoeitin (TPO) levels are usually\nelevated or normal despite an increased megakaryocyte mass and this has been attributed\nto ineffective TPO clearance because of the markedly reduced TPO-receptor (c-Mpl)\nexpression in platelets and megakaryocytes, rather than an overproduction of TPO.12\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis of ET is made by excluding both reactive thrombocytosis and thrombocytosis\nassociated with another myeloid disorder (Table 4) & (Table 5). All cases of thrombocytosis\nfrom automated counter should be counter checked by blood smear to exclude\npseudothrombocytosis secondary to cellular fragments. Table 4.

Instead, thrombotic events occurred at a wide range of\nplatelet counts.16,17,18,19 In two studies, patients with extreme thrombocytosis (>1000x109/L)\nwere reported to have a much higher incidence of haemorrhagic events. This may be due to\nthe acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Leukaemic transformation occurs in less than 5% of all patients with ET.

Maintenance of the platelet count under 400x109/L may be associated with further reduction\nin thrombotic risk.24\nDiagnosis and Management Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders\nThe issue of treatment for low risk patients has been more controversial. Although the study\nby Ruggeri et al 25 concluded that low-risk ET patients do not require treatment, aspirin use\nwas not controlled in this study. The use of low-dose aspirin in this patient group can be\nextrapolated from the ECLAP study.5\nA. General measures\ni. Stop smoking\nii.Avoid NSAIDs\niii.Avoid OCPs, HRTs or Hormonal Therapy\nB.

To date, there is no\nrandomized study that directly implicates hydroxyurea as being more leukemogenic. Some\nlong term studies found that a proportion of ET patients treated with hydroxyurea developed\nacute leukaemia.26,27 In other studies, this drug was not associated with an increase risk of\nleukaemic transformation.28,29 As the leukaemogenecity of hydroxyurea is still being debated,\nit is recommended that this drug is reserved for the elderly (>60 years). Initial starting dose\nis 15-20 mg/kg/day or 500mg daily or bd. Side effects are neutropenia, anaemia, oral ulcers,\nhyperpigmentation, rash and nail changes. Anagrelide is an oral imidazoquinazoline derivative that has a platelet lowering effect. It\ncan control thrombocytosis in > 80% of patients regardless of previous treatments30,31.

Side effects are neutropenia, anaemia, oral ulcers,\nhyperpigmentation, rash and nail changes. Anagrelide is an oral imidazoquinazoline derivative that has a platelet lowering effect. It\ncan control thrombocytosis in > 80% of patients regardless of previous treatments30,31. The\ndrug may interfere with megakaryocyte maturation, resulting in the underproduction of\nplatelets. The mode of action is unclear but it could be that anagrelide blocks the c-mpl\nreceptor on the surface of the megakaryocyte, thereby interfering with the action of\nthrombopoeitin on the cell. As there is no risk of leukaemogenecity with the use of anagrelide,\nthis drug is preferred for younger patients. Initial dose is 0.5mg three to four times a day\n(maximum tolerable daily dose is 8 mg). Side effects are headache, forceful heart beats,\npalpitations, diarrhoea and fluid retention. It is contraindicated in patients with congestive\nheart failure and pregnancy. Diagnosis and Management Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders\nInterferon alpha controls the thrombocytosis associated with any myeloproliferative disorder\nincluding ET. An overview of the literature indicates that treatment with 3 to 5 million units\nsubcutaneously three times a week give an 86% haematologic response rate and a 32%\nreduction in spleen size. However, 20% of patients did not tolerate the treatment because of\nside effects.32 The common side effects are flu-like symptoms, fatigue, anorexia, weight\nloss, alopecia and depression. The use of interferon alpha is restricted to high-risk women\nof childbearing age and to those who are pregnant. Thromboxane is a potent stimulator of platelet aggregation leading to thrombosis. Thromboxane\nsynthesis is increased in patients with ET and can be suppressed with low dose aspirin (75150 mg/day). Low dose aspirin is used to control vasomotor symptoms in the absence of\nbleeding or when the platelet counts have been brought to below 1000x109/L.

One third of patients have a preceding history of PRV or\nET. Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of MMM is suspected if the peripheral blood film shows teardrop-shaped\nred blood cells and leukoerythroblastic picture. The bone marrow aspiration is usually dry\nand trephine biopsy shows marrow fibrosis associated with atypical megakaryocytic\nhyperplasia and thickening with distortion of the bony trabeculae (osteosclerosis). The\ndiagnosis is made after ruling out other causes of marrow fibrosis (Table 7).

Intermediate & High Risk Patients\nHigh-risk patients should be offered haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) if the\nservice is available. Myeloablative allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the\ntreatment of choice for young patients who are less than 45 years old.37,38 For patients older\nthan 45 years, alternative transplant options including non-myeloablative allogeneic and\nautologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered.39,40\nThe management in a center with no transplant option mainly focus in symptomatic relief for\nanaemia, cytoreduction for thrombocytosis and leukocytosis as well as alleviation of\nsplenomegaly-associated complications such as mechanical discomfort, refractory anaemia,\nhypercatabolic symptoms and portal hypertension. Anaemia is the most frequent reason for treatment among patients with MMM. Many patients\nbecome transfusion-dependent and iron chelation may be needed. Only a small proportion of\npatients respond to drug therapy including androgen preparations as a single agent like\nOxymethalone ( 2mg/kg/day) or Danazol (600 to 800 mg/day). All patients treated with androgen\npreparations should have liver functions monitored periodically.41,42 Recently, combination\ntherapy with low dose Thalidomide (50 mg/day) and a tapering dose of prednisolone (0.5 mg/\nkg/day) has been associated with higher response in anaemia (62%).43,44,45 Erythropoietin ( s/c\nEPO 40,000 U/wk ) has been proven for a subset of patients with endogenous EPO level\n<100 mU/mL.46\nDiagnosis and Management Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders\nHydroxyurea (starting dose 500 mg orally twice a day) is the drug of choice for cytoreduction and\ncontrolling splenomegaly.47 However, anaemia may worsen and some authors advocate combination\ntherapy with Erythropoietin. Interferon-alfa has been used in the similar setting with favorable results\nreported.48 Lately, Anagrelide may be used for cases with problematic thrombocytosis. Splenectomy is the option for patients who are drug-refractory to alleviate splenomegaly-associated\ncomplications. Operative mortality was about 9% with a post operative median survival of 27 months.
