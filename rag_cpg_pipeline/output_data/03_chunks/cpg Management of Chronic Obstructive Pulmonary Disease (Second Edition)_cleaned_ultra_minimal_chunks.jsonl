It is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States1\nand is projected to rank fifth by 2020 in terms of burden of disease worldwide, according to a study\nby the World Bank and World Health Organization.2 Yet COPD is relatively unknown to the public and\noften ignored by health policy makers and government officials. In 1998, the Malaysian Thoracic Society with the support of the Academy of Medicine of Malaysia\nand Ministry of Health of Malaysia in their efforts to create awareness about the disease and\nimprove patient care, initiated the publication of COPD management guidelines to be used as a\nreference for medical practitioners.3 The working group comprised 10 respiratory specialists who\nwere working in government hospitals, teaching institutions and private medical facilities. The\nrecommendations made were mainly based on the published literature available at the time after\nthorough assessment by the assigned member or members of the working group and discussion\nat several face-to-face meetings. The evidence used for the recommendations was then graded\naccording to its level of strength with some recommendations made based on the consensus\nagreement of members of the working group. Notwithstanding, the concept of evidence-based\nmedicine was just emerging at that time. After more than a decade, with advancement of care\nmade and with the publication of many important large-scale, randomised studies which added\nnew dimension to the management of COPD, the time had come for these guidelines to be reviewed\nand updated. An updated set of CPG will ensure that the recommendations for the management\nof COPD in Malaysia are current. We would like to emphasise the importance of (1) early diagnosis\nthrough targeted spirometry and early intervention including smoking cessation even in mild COPD;\n(2) improving dyspnoea and activity limitation in stable COPD using up-to-date evidence-based\ntreatment algorithms; and (3) preventing and managing acute exacerbations, particularly in more\nsevere COPD. I sincerely hope this revised edition of the CPG for the Management of COPD will be fully utilised\nby all relevant healthcare professionals and will benefit patients suffering from COPD.", "chunk_order": 0}

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGuidelines Development\nRespiratory physicians working in government hospitals, academic institutions and private medical\nfacilities; an emergency medicine physician and primary care physicians from a government health\nclinic, an academic institution and private general practice were invited to be members of the\nguidelines development working group. The previous edition of the CPG on the Management of COPD (1998) was used as the basis for\nthe development of this present set of guidelines. Members of the working group were divided\ninto smaller groups comprising 2 to 5 members who were assigned to prepare documents on\nthe following sections: (1) definition, classification of severity and mechanism of COPD;\n(2) burden of COPD; (3) risk factors; (4) assessment and monitoring of disease; (5) reducing risk\nfactors; (6) managing stable COPD - pharmacological treatments; (7) managing stable COPD -\nnon-pharmacological treatments; (8) managing exacerbations; and (9) translating guidelines\nrecommendations to the context of primary care. Members responsible for each section were tasked to ensure that the relevant literature was\nadequately searched, retrieved, critically appraised and accurately presented. Literature search\nwas carried out at electronic databases which included PUBMED, Medline and Cochrane Database\nof Systemic Reviews. The full text of reference articles quoted in these guidelines was carefully\nstudied. In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify\nother studies.", "chunk_order": 1}

The full text of reference articles quoted in these guidelines was carefully\nstudied. In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify\nother studies. Other guidelines on the management of COPD that were referred to included the\n\u201cGuidelines of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) global strategy\nfor the diagnosis, management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\u201d (2008)\nand the \u201cCanadian Thoracic Society recommendations for management of chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease\u201d(2007). Each section leader presented his/her section of the proposed guidelines at several meetings\nwhere all members of the working group met and participated in the discussion. The final draft\nof these guidelines inclusive of recommendations was the result of agreement by the majority, if\nnot all, members of the working group at such meetings as well as through e-mail discussions in\nbetween the meetings. Throughout the development of these guidelines, a total of six meetings\nwere held from 10 January 2009. In situations where the evidence was insufficient or lacking, the\nrecommendations made were by consensus of the working group. In these guidelines, statements are supported by evidence which is graded using the United\nStates/Canadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence scale with the level of evidence\nindicated in parentheses after the relevant statement, while the grading of recommendations was\nbased on modified Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\u2019s (SIGN) Grade of Recommendations\nwhich is also shown in parentheses. The draft guidelines were sent for external review. The draft guidelines were also posted on the\nMinistry of Health Malaysia website for comments and feedback. These guidelines were presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Health Technology\nAssessment and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and\napproval. Objectives\nThe main objective of these guidelines is to provide up-to-date evidence-based recommendations\nto assist health care providers in the identification, diagnosis and optimal management of people\nwith COPD. Clinical Questions\nThe clinical questions of these guidelines are:\n1. How can COPD be prevented? 2. How is COPD diagnosed? 3. How can people with COPD be optimally managed? Target Population\nThese guidelines are applicable to all adults with COPD. Target Groups/Users\nThese guidelines are intended for all health care professionals involved in managing patients\nwith COPD who include: respiratory physicians, general physicians, geriatricians, family medicine\nspecialists, emergency medicine physicians, medical officers, general practitioners, assistant\nmedical officers, pharmacists, respiratory nurse educators, nurses, physiotherapists and public\nhealth personnel.", "chunk_order": 2}

CLINICAL INDICATORS FOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT\nProportion of people with COPD treated for acute exacerbation (with antibiotics and/or systemic\ncorticosteroids and/or requiring hospitalisation)\nNumerator\n: Number of episodes of acute exacerbation treated in one year#\nDenominator : Total number of patients with COPD on treatment in one year\n(#It is necessary to distinguish patients with moderate stable COPD from those with severe or very\nsevere stable COPD)\nThe optimum achievable standard:\nFor patients with\n\u2022\nModerate COPD\n: \u2264 1 exacerbation per patient per year\n\u2022\nSevere or very severe COPD : \u2264 1.5 exacerbations per patient per year\nThese standards are arrived at based on the results of several recent large randomised controlled trials. In the INSPIRE study involving patients with severe and very severe COPD (FEV1 < 50% predicted), the\nexacerbations rates were 1.28 per year in patients treated with salmeterol/fluticasone combination\nand 1.32 per year in patients on tiotropium.1 (Level 1) In the TORCH study involving patients with moderate\nto very severe COPD (FEV1 < 60% predicted), treatment with salmeterol, fluticasone and salmeterol/\nfluticasone combination was associated with exacerbation rates of 0.97, 0.93 and 0.85, respectively\ncompared to 1.13 in patients on placebo.2 (Level 1) In the UPLIFT study involving patients with moderate\nto very severe COPD (FEV1 \u2264 70% predicted) already on a regular b2-agonist with or without inhaled\ncorticosteroids, treatment with tiotropium or placebo was associated with exacerbation rates of 0.73\nand 0.85 per patient-year, respectively.3 (Level 1)\nReferences:\n1.

SECTION 1\nDEFINITION, CLASSIFICATION OF SEVERITY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\n1.1 Definition\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a preventable and treatable respiratory disorder\nlargely caused by smoking, is characterised by progressive, partially reversible airflow obstruction\nand lung hyperinflation with significant extrapulmonary (systemic) manifestations1 (Level II-2) and comorbid conditions2 (Level II-3) all of which may contribute to the severity of the disease in individual\npatients. The co-morbid conditions associated with COPD include ischaemic heart disease; osteopenia,\nosteoporosis and bone fractures; cachexia and malnutrition; normochromic normocytic anaemia;\nskeletal muscle wasting and peripheral muscle dysfunction; diabetes mellitus; sleep disorders;\ncataracts and glaucoma; lung cancer; and anxiety and depression both of which increase in\nincidence with disease severity.1-9 (Level II-2)\n1.2 Airflow Limitation in COPD\nThe chronic airflow limitation in COPD is due to a mixture of small airway disease (obstructive\nbronchiolitis) and lung parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contributions of which\nvary from individual to individual. Airflow limitation, associated with an abnormal inflammatory\nreaction of the lung to noxious particles or gases, the most common of which worldwide is cigarette\nsmoke, is usually progressive, especially if exposure to the noxious agents persists. Airflow limitation is best measured by spirometry, the most widely available and reproducible test\nof lung function. 1.3 Spirometric Classification of COPD Severity\nObjective demonstration of airflow obstruction by spirometry is essential for the diagnosis of\nCOPD. Spirometry also provides an assessment of the severity of pathological changes in COPD. Spirometry should be performed after an adequate dose of an inhaled bronchodilator (e.g., 400 \u00b5g\nof salbutamol)10 (Level III) in order to minimise variability. For diagnosis and severity assessment of COPD, a post-bronchodilator FEV1 /FVC ratio of < 0.70\nand post-bronchodilator FEV1 measurement, respectively are recommended.11 (Level III) A simple but\nyet to be clinically validated classification of COPD severity into four stages based on spirometric\ncut-points (FEV1 < 80, 50, or 30% predicted) is recommended (Table 1-1).11 (Level III)\nTable 1-1 Classification of COPD Severity11 (Level III)\nCOPD\nstage\nSeverity\nPost-bronchodilator\nspirometric values11 (Level III)\nSymptoms that may be present\nI\nMild\nFEV1/FVC < 0.70\nFEV1 > 80% predicted\nChronic cough and sputum\nproduction may be present.

This is the stage at which patients\nusually seek medical attention\nbecause of chronic respiratory\nsymptoms or an exacerbation of\nCOPD.

IV\nVery\nsevere\nFEV1/FVC < 0.70\nFEV1 < 30% predicted\nor\nFEV1 < 50% predicted plus\nchronic respiratory failure\nRespiratory failure may lead to\ncor pulmonale with signs which\ninclude elevation of the jugular\nvenous pressure and pitting ankle\noedema. At this stage, quality\nof life is markedly impaired\nand exacerbations may be life-\nthreatening. FEV1: forced expiratory volume in one second; FVC: forced vital capacity; respiratory failure: arterial partial\npressure of oxygen (PaO2) less than 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg) with or without arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2)\ngreater than 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg) while breathing air at sea level. 1.4 Assessment of COPD Severity\nThe relationship between the degree of airflow limitation based on spirometry and COPD symptoms\nis not perfect. The impact of COPD on an individual patient depends not just on the degree of airflow\nlimitation, but also on the severity of symptoms - especially breathlessness and decreased exercise\ncapacity. COPD management decisions for the individual patient should therefore not be based\nsolely on spirometry results, but also on the severity of dyspnoea and disability12 (Level III) which can\nbe assessed using the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnoea scale (Table 1-2)13\n(Level III) which reflects overall disease impact among COPD patients than FEV1. A multidimensional grading system of disease severity, the BODE index [body mass index (BMI),\nairflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise capacity], better predicts survival in COPD patients than\nFEV1.14 (Level II-2) A simple but yet to be validated classification of COPD severity can be based on both\nspirometry and symptoms (Table 1-3) bearing in mind that there may be poor correlation between\nspirometric measures of lung function and symptoms in individual patients.", "chunk_order": 7}

These pathological changes lead to mucus hypersecretion,18 (Level II-2) expiratory airflow limitation\nwith dynamic small airway collapse causing air trapping and lung hyperinflation, gas exchange\nabnormalities, and progressive pulmonary hypertension that may lead to cor pulmonale.19 (Level II-2)\nThere is further amplification of the inflammatory response in the airways during exacerbations,\nwhich may be triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by environmental pollutants.

The risk of COPD in smokers is dose-\nrelated.42 Pipe and cigar smokers have greater COPD morbidity and mortality rates than nonsmokers, although their rates are lower than those for cigarette smokers.43 (Level III) Environmental\ntobacco smoke also contributes to respiratory symptoms and COPD by increasing the lungs\u2019 total\nburden of inhaled particles and gases.44,45 (Level II-2) Pregnant women are advised to stop smoking\nas tobacco smoke poses a risk to the foetus by affecting lung growth and development in\nutero.46 (Level II-3)\n\u2022\nOccupational dusts and chemicals\nOccupational exposures are independently associated with the severity of airflow limitation,\nrespiratory symptoms, and employment status in patients with COPD.47 (Level II-3) These exposures\ninclude organic and inorganic dusts, chemical agents and fumes. Livestock farmers have an\nincreased risk of chronic bronchitis, COPD and reduced FEV1.

The dyspnoea is progressive over months or years and is persistent. As lung function deteriorates,\nthe breathlessness interferes with patients\u2019 daily activities. Cough is often the first symptom of COPD which may initially be intermittent but later present\ndaily, often with chronic sputum production. Wheezing and chest tightness may also be present. Extrapulmonary effects such as weight loss, signs of cor pulmonale and other co-morbid conditions\nshould also be identified and assessed.72 (Level III) Psychiatric morbidity is common in advanced\nCOPD.73 (Level III)\nCOPD patients experience fluctuations in symptoms and general feelings of well-being which can\nvary from day to day. 4.3 Medical History\nA thorough medical history should include the following:\n\u2022\nCurrent symptoms and the pattern of symptom development including severity of\nbreathlessness, for example using the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnoea\nscale (Table 1-2)13\n\u2022\nExposure to risk factors and possibilities for eliminating or reducing exposure\n-\nSmoking history\nQuantification of tobacco consumption: total pack-years = (number of cigarettes smoked\nper day \u00f7 20) x number of years of smoking\n-\nOccupational and environmental exposures to other lung irritants\n\u2022\nImpact of disease on psychosocial well being\n\u2022\nPast medical history including exacerbations and admissions for respiratory illnesses\n\u2022\nFamily history of any respiratory disorder\n\u2022\nPresence of other co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, psychiatric illness, malignancy,\nosteoporosis and musculoskeletal disorders\n\u2022\nAll current medical therapy and its appropriateness\n\u2022\nSocial and family support available to the patient\n4.4 Physical Examination\nPhysical examination is not usually diagnostic of COPD but is an important part of patient care. Physical signs of airflow limitation and air trapping (barrel chest, loss of cardiac and liver dullness,\nprolonged expiration, reduced breath sounds) are not usually present until the disease is already at\nan advanced stage. Physical examination may detect co-morbidities or other illnesses and detect\nthe development of complications of COPD such as malnourishment and cor pulmonale. 4.5 Measurement of Lung Function\nSpirometry is required to confirm the diagnosis of COPD and to assess the severity of the disease. Spirometry should be performed in people with exposure to risk factors who have chronic cough\nand sputum production even without dyspnoea as it may help identify patients earlier in the\ncourse of the disease.13,74 (Level III) Peak flow measurements can detect airflow limitation but has\npoor specificity.", "chunk_order": 14}

The relationship between peak expiratory flow and FEV1 is poor in COPD.75 (Level II-2)\n4.6 Bronchodilator Reversibility Testing\nBronchodilator testing is required to establish the best attainable lung function at that point of\ntime. Response to a bronchodilator is considered significant if the change in FEV1 is both at least\n200 mL and 12% above the pre-bronchodilator FEV1.76 (Level III) If there is a marked response to\nbronchodilators, asthma should be considered. A proportion of COPD patients may show significant\nresponse to bronchodilators.77 (Level III)\n4.7 Assessment of COPD Severity\nCOPD severity is based on the patient\u2019s level of symptoms, the severity of spirometric abnormality\nbased on FEV1 and the presence of complications such as respiratory failure and cor pulmonale\n(Table 1-3).78 (Level III) Multi-dimensional assessment of severity includes the BODE index79 (Level II-2) and\nthe locally developed SAFE index.80 (Level II-2)\n4.8 Additional Investigations\ni. Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)\nThis test measures the distance covered during six minutes and is a useful test of exercise capacity\n81 (Level III) and provides prognostic information.82 (Level II-2) Arterial oxygen desaturation can be measured\nwith a pulse oximeter during walking. ii. Chest Radiograph\nA chest radiograph is valuable in excluding other diagnoses such as lung cancer, heart failure,\nbronchiectasis and tuberculosis. Radiological changes associated with COPD include the presence\nof hyperinflation (flattened diaphragm and increased lung volume), bullae and hyperlucency of the\nlungs. High resolution computed tomography scanning is not routinely recommended unless there\nis diagnostic uncertainty. iii. Arterial Blood Gas Analysis\nThis should be performed in patients with FEV1 < 40% predicted if they have low arterial oxygen\nsaturation (less than 92% on pulse oximetry) or with clinical signs of respiratory failure or cor\npulmonale as these patients may benefit from long term oxygen therapy at home.83 (Level III)\niv.

Ongoing monitoring and assessment\nin COPD is vital to ensure that the goals of treatment are being met. Follow-up visits should include evaluation of the following:\n\u2022\nExposure to risk factors especially tobacco smoke. Ask about smoking and their willingness to\nstop (Refer to Section 5). \u2022\nCurrent symptoms and any new or worsening symptoms to suggest deterioration in lung\nfunction or development of complications. Consider the presence of concomitant conditions or\nco-morbidities. \u2022\nPhysical examination to detect complications such as respiratory failure or cor pulmonale and\nother co-morbidities. Body weight and body mass index provide information on the nutritional\nstatus of the patient. \u2022\nSpirometry measurement especially if symptoms worsen. Active smokers and patients with\nfrequent exacerbations are at risk of faster decline in lung function. \u2022\nPharmacotherapy and other medical treatment.

It is important for patients with COPD to understand the nature of their\ndisease, risk factors for progression and strategies to help minimise symptoms. Recommendations: Diagnosis and Assessment of Severity\n1. The diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed by spirometry showing a post-bronchodilator\nFEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7. [Grade C]\n2. Assessment of COPD severity should be based on the severity of spirometric abnormality, the\npatient\u2019s symptoms, exercise capacity and the presence of co-morbidities and complications. [Grade C]\nSection 5\nREDUCING RISK FACTORS\n5.1 Introduction\nIdentification, reduction, control and elimination of risk factors are important steps toward effective\nprevention and management of any disease. For COPD, these risk factors include tobacco smoke,\noccupational exposures, indoor and outdoor air pollution and irritants. Since cigarette smoking is\nthe most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD worldwide, priority must be given to tobacco\ncontrol programmes. Smoking prevention strategies and availability of smoking cessation services\nshould be emphasised to encourage smoke-free lifestyles. 5.2 Smoking Prevention\nSmoking prevention is the single most effective intervention to reduce the risk of developing\nCOPD and stop its progression.68 (Level I) This is endorsed by the international community with the\nestablishment of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2005. \u2022\nComprehensive tobacco control policies and programmmes with clear, consistent, and\nrepeated nonsmoking messages should be delivered through every feasible channel, including\nhealth care providers; community activities; schools; and radio, television, and the print media. Mandatory legal provision for pictorial health warnings on cigarette packs and packages is an\nefficient way to deliver clear, truthful anti-smoking messages directly to smokers. \u2022\nNational and local campaigns should be undertaken to reduce exposure to tobacco smoke\nin public places. Such bans are proven to work, resulting in measurable gains in respiratory\nhealth.84 (Level I)\n\u2022\nSmoking prevention programmes should target all ages, including young children, adolescents,\nyoung adults, and pregnant women. \u2022\nInterventions to prevent smoking uptake and maximise cessation should be implemented at\nevery level of the health care system. \u2022\nDoctors and public health officials should encourage smoke-free environments, including\nsmoke-free homes.", "chunk_order": 17}

Second-hand smoke exposure is also an important cause of respiratory symptoms and increased\nrisk for COPD, especially in partners and offspring of smokers.85 (Level I) Long-term indoor exposure,\ncombined with crowded living conditions in poorly ventilated homes, adds to the total burden of\nparticulate exposure and increases the risk of developing COPD.86 (Level I) Adults should not smoke in\nthe immediate vicinity of non-smokers, especially children, nor in enclosed spaces such as cars and\npoorly ventilated rooms that expose others to increased risk. Children less than two years old who are\npassively exposed to cigarette smoke have an increased prevalence of respiratory infections, and are\nat a greater risk of developing chronic respiratory symptoms later in life.87.88 (Level I)\n5.3 Smoking Cessation\nQuitting smoking can prevent or delay the development of airflow limitation, or reduce its\nprogression,88 (Level I) and can have a substantial effect on subsequent mortality.89 (Level I) All smokers\n\u2013 including those who may be at risk for COPD as well as those who already have the disease \u2013\nshould be offered the most intensive smoking cessation intervention available. Smoking cessation interventions are effective in both sexes, in all racial and ethnic groups, and\nin pregnant women. Age influences quit rates, with young people less likely to quit. Nevertheless,\nsmoking cessation programmes can be effective in all age groups. Effective interventions include\nindividual as well as group programmes such as community-based stop-smoking challenges. The\nessential approaches are:\n1. Pharmacotherapy\n\u2022 Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of transdermal patches, gums, lozenges and\nnasal sprays\n\u2022 Varenicline\n\u2022 Bupropion\n\u2022 Nortriptyline\n2. Counselling from doctors and other health professionals, given either by individual face-to-face\ninteractions, group interactions or through telephone or web-based quit smoking services\n3. Combination of counselling and pharmacotherapy\nA successful smoking cessation strategy requires a multi-faceted approach that includes sustained\nescalation in tobacco taxation, coherent government policies and legislations to reduce tobacco\ndemands and production as well as health education and frequent dissemination of consistent antitobacco messages through the media and settings such as schools.90,91 (Level III) However, healthcare\nproviders, including doctors, nurses, dentists, psychologists, pharmacists and others, are key to the\ndelivery of smoking cessation messages and interventions. Healthcare workers should encourage all\npatients who smoke to quit, even those patients who attend for unrelated reasons and do not have\nsymptoms of COPD.92 (Level III)\n5.4 Five Step Programme for Intervention (5A)91 (Level III)\n1.

ASK:\nSystematically identify all tobacco users at every visit. Implement an office-wide system that ensures that, for EVERY patient at EVERY\nclinic visit, tobacco-use status is queried and documented. 2. ADVISE:\nStrongly urge all tobacco users to quit in a clear, strong, and personalised manner. 3. ASSESS:\nDetermine willingness to make a quit attempt. Ask every tobacco user if he or she is willing to make a quit attempt at this time\n(e.g., within the next 30 days). 4. ASSIST:\nAid the patient in quitting. a. Help the patient with a quit plan\nb. Provide practical counselling\nc. Provide intra-treatment social support\nd. Help the patient obtain extra-treatment social support\ne. Recommend use of approved pharmacotherapy except in special\ncircumstances\nf. Provide supplementary materials. 5. ARRANGE: Schedule follow-up contact, either in person or via telephone. 5.5 Counselling\nCounselling delivered by doctors and other healthcare professionals significantly increases quit\nrates over self-initiated strategies.93 (Level I) Even a brief (three-minute) period of counselling to urge\na smoker to quit results in smoking cessation rates of 5-10%.94 (Level II-2) At the very least, this should\nbe done for every smoker at every healthcare provider visit.95 (Level III)\n5.6 Pharmacotherapy\nNumerous effective pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation now exist,96 (Level III) and\npharmacotherapy is recommended when counselling is not sufficient to help patients quit smoking. Special consideration should be given before using pharmacotherapy in selected populations:\n\u2022\nPeople with medical contraindications\n\u2022\nLight smokers (fewer than 10 cigarettes/day)\n\u2022\nSmokers who are pregnant\n\u2022\nAdolescent smokers. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy are significantly more effective than placebo.96 (Level III)\nEvery effort should be made to tailor the choice of replacement therapy to the individual\u2019s culture\nand lifestyle to improve adherence. Other pharmacotherapy, like bupropion97 (Level I) and nortriptyline\nhave also been shown to increase long term quit rates,98,99 (Level I) but should always be used as one\nelement in a supportive intervention programme rather than on their own. Varenicline, a nicotinic\nacetylcholine receptor partial\u00a0agonist that aids smoking cessation by relieving nicotine withdrawal\nsymptoms and reducing the rewarding properties of nicotine has been demonstrated to be safe and\nefficacious.100 (Level I) The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, mostly mild or moderate which\nusually subsides over time. There are recent concerns that varenicline may be linked with depressed\nmood, agitation or suicidal thinking and behaviour in some smokers.101 (Level III)\n5.7 Occupational Exposure\nMany occupations have been shown to be associated with increased risk of developing COPD,\nparticularly those that involve exposure to fumes and mineral and biological dusts.", "chunk_order": 19}

Although\nit is not known how many individuals are at risk of developing respiratory disease from\noccupational exposures, many occupationally induced respiratory disorders can be reduced or\ncontrolled through a variety of strategies aimed at reducing the burden of inhaled particles and\ngases.102 (Level lI-2),103,104 (Level III)\nThe main emphasis should be on primary prevention, which is best achieved by the elimination or\nreduction of exposures to various substances in the workplace. Secondary prevention, achieved\nthrough surveillance and early case detection, is also of great importance. Both approaches are\nnecessary to improve the present situation and to reduce the burden of lung disease. 5.8\u00a0Indoor and Outdoor Air Pollution\nIndividuals experience diverse indoor and outdoor environments throughout the day, each of which\nhas its own unique set of air contaminants and particulates that cause adverse effects on lung\nfunction.104 (Level III)\nReducing the risk from indoor and outdoor air pollution is feasible and requires a combination of\npublic policy and protective steps taken by individual patients. Reduction of exposure to smoke from\nbiomass fuel, particularly among women and children, is a crucial goal to reduce the prevalence\nof COPD. 5.9 Steps for Health Care Providers/Patients\nThe health care provider should consider COPD risk factors including smoking history, family\nhistory, exposure to indoor/outdoor pollution and socioeconomic status for each individual patient. Some steps to consider are:\n\u2022\nIndividuals at risk for COPD should be counselled concerning the nature and degree of their risk\nfor COPD\n\u2022\nIf various solid fuels are used for cooking and heating, adequate ventilation should be\nencouraged\n\u2022\nRespiratory protective equipment has been developed for use in the workplace in order to\nminimise exposure to toxic gases and particles\n\u2022\nVentilation and interventions to meet safe air quality standards in the workplace offer the\ngreatest opportunity to reduce worker exposure to known atmospheric pollutants and reduce\nthe risk of developing COPD. In patients who have been diagnosed with COPD:\n\u2022\nPersons with advanced COPD should monitor public announcements of air quality and be\naware that staying indoors when air quality is poor may help reduce their symptoms. \u2022\nThe use of medication should follow the usual clinical indications; therapeutic regimens should\nnot be adjusted because of the occurrence of a pollution episode without evidence of worsening\nof symptoms or lung function. Recommendation: Smoking Cessation\n1. Smoking cessation is the single most effective and cost effective intervention in most people\nto reduce the risk of developing COPD and stop its progression.

It is aimed to\nimprove their quality of life. Topics for patient education may include:\n\u2022\nA brief explanation on\no The aetiologies of COPD which will enable patients to take necessary steps toward avoiding\nthese risk factors\no The pathophysiological changes of COPD which have contributed to their symptoms\no The differences between asthma and COPD (refer to Table 4-2). \u2022\nInformation about the natural course of the illness:\no COPD is a progressive disease\no Smoking cessation has the most significant effect on modifying the course of disease\nprogression\no COPD exacerbation accelerates disease progression. Education has been shown to improve\nhealth outcomes in patients with chronic illnesses.106 (Level I),107 (Level III)\n\u2022\nPatients should be counselled on their roles in optimising treatment and health outcomes. Studies have shown that education plays a role in improving patients\u2019 skills, ability to cope with\nillness and health status.108,109 (Level III), 110 (Level II-1), 111 (Level I)\n\u2022\nInstruction on how to use an inhaler, assessing inhaler technique (consider recommending a\nholding-chamber if technique is unsatisfactory) and other treatment. \u2022\nSelf-management plan in acute situation (e.g., recognition of a COPD exacerbation, treatment\nintervention; and, when to seek medical help). \u2022\nStrategies on minimising dyspnoea. \u2022\nInformation on proper nutrition intake, exercise and pulmonary rehabilitation. \u2022\nRoles of vaccination. \u2022\nFor patients with more severe disease, counselling may include:\no Information about complications of COPD\no information about long-term oxygen therapy\no Advanced directive and end-of-life decisions. Prospective end-of-life discussion can lead\nto better understanding of advanced directives and effective therapeutic decision at end of\nlife.112 (Level II-1)\nLimited published data suggest that the chronic care model in COPD management results in\nlower rates of hospitalisations and emergency/unscheduled visits and shorter lengths of hospital\nstay.113 (Level I) However, COPD patients recruited to a comprehensive COPD education programme\nin Canada had significantly fewer exacerbations and hospitalisations.114 (Level I) They also utilised\nless health care resources.

Some reports state\nthat the vaccine has up to a 65% efficacy in COPD patients,118 (Level II-2) although an effect on\nreducing the frequency of COPD exacerbation has yet to be established. \u2022\nA recent report demonstrated a reduction in the prevalence of community-acquired pneumonia\nfollowing pneumococcal vaccination in a subgroup of COPD patients younger than 65 years\nwith an FEV1 < 40% predicted.119 (Level I)\n\u2022\nHence, a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) is recommended for patients who are\nyounger than 65 years but with a FEV1 < 40 % predicted (irrespective of age)\n\u2022\nEven though the vaccination of PPV23 remains controversial, the panels support the WHO\nposition stand to vaccinate all COPD patients at least once in their lifetime and have it repeated\n\u2265 5 years (with a maximum of two doses in one\u2019s lifetime).120 (Level III)\n6.5 Treatment Strategy: Consisting of Pharmacological & Non-pharmacological Interventions\n6.5.1 Pharmacological Therapy\n\u2022\nBronchodilators remain the mainstay of pharmacological therapy. o They reduce airway smooth muscle tone, improve expiratory flow rate, reduce air-trapping\nand hyperinflation of the lung. o They also improve the patients\u2019 dyspnoea scores, increase exercise tolerance, reduce\ndisability in daily living and improve overall health status. o Optimal pharmacotherapy should be guided by the patients\u2019 symptoms, level of activity and\nfrequency of COPD exacerbation. Inhaled short-acting bronchodilators\n\u2022\nThese include inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonists (SABAs) and inhaled short-acting anticholinergics\n(SAACs).

Nonetheless, they have not\nbeen shown to have a consistent impact on quality of life.121 (Level I)\nInhaled SAACs\n(Example: MDI ipratropium bromide 40 \u00b5g 6 hourly)\n\u2022\nInhaled SAACs act on the muscarinic receptors by blocking their bronchoconstrictor\neffects and reducing mucus secretions. An increase in FEV1 was observed with\nanticholinergics compared to the placebo.122-125 (Level I) Some studies also found that the\ninhalation of SAACs is associated with an improvement in dyspnoea, a reduction in\nthe need for rescue medications,123-126 (Level I) and an improvement in the quality of life.125 (Level I) The\ncombination of inhaled SABA and SAAC achieves a greater bronchodilator effect than\neither one alone.123,127 (Level I) However, there was no data to show that either SAAC or SABA\nreduces exacerbation.

On the other hand, the OPTIMAL study showed that adding ICS/LABA to\ntiotropium significantly improved lung function, improved quality of life and reduced hospitalisation\nbut did not reduce exacerbation rates.137 (Level I)\nInhaled corticosteroids (ICS)\n(Examples: fluticasone 500 \u00b5g twice daily by Accuhaler\u00ae, budesonide 400 \u00b5g twice daily by\nTurbuhaler\u00ae)\n\u2022\nThe trial outcomes using ICS on COPD are rather conflicting. The EUROSCOP trial143 (Level I) and\nthe Copenhagen Lung Health Study144 (Level I) showed the use of ICS in mild COPD does not slow\nthe rate of decline of FEV1.

Two recent multi-centre\nrandomised controlled studies confirmed that ICS alone improves FEV1 and health-related\nquality of life, and reduces moderate to severe exacerbations.128,140 (Level I) Furthermore, the\nTORCH study showed a slower rate of decline in lung function in patients taking high dose ICS\nalone (42 mL/year) as compared with placebo (55 mL/year).141 (Level II-1)\nOral corticosteroids\n\u2022 About 10% of COPD patients show significant improvement in lung function (defined as an\nimprovement of at least 20% of FEV1) after oral corticosteroid administration.147 (Level I)\n\u2022\nHowever, chronic systemic corticosteroid usage is known to be associated with potentially\nserious side-effects such as osteoporosis, premature cataract, muscle weakness, diabetes\nmellitus and hypertension. \u2022\nIndeed, one study showed that in severe COPD patients, maintenance treatment with oral\nglucocorticoids is\u00a0associated with increased mortality in a dose-dependent manner.148 (Level II-2)\nHence, prolonged courses of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD should be\ndiscouraged.148 (Level II-2)\nCombination of LAAC and ICS\nThere is no data to support the use of this combination.

Recommendations: Managing Stable COPD\n1. Treatment recommendation should be based on disease severity, symptoms and frequency of\nCOPD exacerbations (Figure 6.1). [Grade C]\n2. COPD patients at any stage of disease severity should be advised to quit smoking if they still\nsmoke. [Grade A]\n3. In patients with mild COPD who are symptomatic, SABA or SAAC or a combination of both may\nbe prescribed. [Grade C]\n4.

It includes exercise, education, psychosocial and behavioural intervention by\nan interdisciplinary team of specialists.159 (Level III)\nMost structured pulmonary rehabilitation programmes last between 6 and 12 weeks.160,161 (Level III)\nThey have been demonstrated to produce benefits that last between 12 and 18 months. There\nis no consensus on the optimal duration of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. An exercise\nprogramme can be helpful in the home162-164 (Level I); 165,166 (Level II-1), in the hospital167 (Level II-1) or in\ncommunity settings.168 (Level I) In Malaysia, only a small fraction of patients with COPD are able to get\nexercise training as only a few hospitals have programmes that provide closely supervised exercise\ntraining and access to these programs is limited. General aerobic conditioning is more helpful than specific training of respiratory\nmuscles.160,161 (Level III),169 (Level I) The muscles of ambulation should be a focus of pulmonary rehabilitation,\nemphasising endurance and strength training. Benefit is seen even in irreversible pulmonary\ndisorders, since much of the disability and handicap results not just from the respiratory disorder\nper se but from secondary morbidities that often are treatable. Although the degree of airway\nobstruction or lung hyperinflation does not change much with pulmonary rehabilitation, reversal\nof muscle deconditioning and better pacing enables patients to walk further with less dyspnoea.", "chunk_order": 29}

Domiciliary oxygen therapy is available in Malaysia from a variety of providers. Oxygen\nconcentrators are generally regarded more cost-effective. It should be prescribed by a qualified\nmedical practitioner and titrated carefully due to concerns of carbon dioxide retention. Patients\nshould be reassessed 1\u20132 months after starting continuous or nocturnal oxygen therapy, both\nclinically and by measurement of PaO2 and PaCO2.175 (Level I) Subsequent review should be undertaken\nat least annually, or more often, according to the clinical situation.

Weight loss may further exacerbate\ndecreased respiratory muscle strength and increase dyspnoea and impair immunity.178 (Level II-2), 179\n(Level I) The general assessment of patients with COPD should include weight and the calculation of\nBMI at each visit. The goal is to try to maintain a reasonable body weight and BMI (between 22\nand 27 kg/m2) and keep serum albumin levels above 35 g/L.179 (Level I) A balanced diet with adequate\ncaloric intake in conjunction with exercise to prevent or reverse malnutrition and muscle atrophy\nis prudent.180 (Level III) However, excessive weight gain should be avoided, and obese patients should\nstrive to gradually reduce body fat.

[Grade A]\n7.6 COPD and Surgery\nA careful evaluation of patients with COPD undergoing surgery should include identification of\nhigh-risk patients and aggressive treatment. Elective surgery should be deferred in patients who\nare symptomatic, have poor exercise capacity or have acute exacerbations. Patients with COPD are several times more likely to have a major postoperative complication.190,191\n(Level II-2), 192 (Level I), 193 (Level II-2) Similarly, an FEV1 < 60% predicted was found to be an independent predictor\nof increased mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft procedures.194 (Level III) In\ngeneral, the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is inversely related to the distance\nof the surgical incision from the diaphragm.194 (Level III)\nThe risk of respiratory failure is increased in patients undergoing pneumonectomy with a\npreoperative FEV1 of < 2 L or < 50% predicted and/or diffusing capacity of the lungs (DLCO) < 50%\npredicted.195 (Level III) High risk patients should undergo further testing such as lung perfusion and\nexercise capacity tests.195 (Level III) Benefits of surgery must be weighed against known risks. Patients with COPD should be treated aggressively to achieve the best possible baseline function. Bronchodilators, smoking cessation (at least 4-8 weeks preoperatively is optimal), antibiotics, and\nchest physical therapy may help significantly reduce pulmonary complications.195-197 (Level III) The\nrole of pre-operative steroids is uncertain although smaller studies have indicated reduction of\npostoperative pulmonary and non-pulmonary complications in COPD patients undergoing coronary\nartery bypass surgery.198 (Level II-1), 199 (Level II-2) Consider postponing elective surgery if improvement of\npulmonary function is possible and requires more time.

[Grade B]\nSection 8\nMANAGING EXACERBATIONS OF COPD\n8.1 Introduction\nThe natural course of COPD is of gradual decline in lung function with episodes of exacerbations. 8.2 Definition of Acute Exacerbation of COPD\nExacerbation is defined as an event in the natural course of the disease characterised by a sustained\n(lasting 48 hours or more) worsening of the patient\u2019s baseline dyspnoea, cough, and/or sputum that\nis beyond normal day-to-day variations, is acute in onset, and may warrant a change in regular\nmedication.69,204 (Level III)\n8.3 Morbidity and Mortality Associated with Acute Exacerbations of COPD\nAcute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality205 (Level III) and incurs\nhuge cost in terms of healthcare resource utilisation.206 (Level II-2) Exacerbations impact negatively on lung\nfunction207 (Level II-2) and HRQoL.208 (Level III) The impact is significant and patients may take a long time to\nrecover.209 (Level II-2) Some patients never recover fully and have repeated exacerbations.209 (Level II-2)\nMeasures to prevent AECOPD are important to reduce morbidity and mortality. AECOPD should be\nsuspected if smokers present with symptoms of chest infection. 8.4 Causes of Acute Exacerbations of COPD\nExacerbations are associated with an increase in airway inflammation and are caused mainly by\nlower respiratory tract infections and inhalation of pollutants. Cigarette smoking is a major cause\nof COPD and smoking cessation is effective in reducing risk of exacerbation210 (Level II-2) and risk of\nhospitalisation.211 (Level II-2) Most (50 to 60%) exacerbations are caused by bacterial or viral respiratory\ninfections,212 (Level III), 213 (Level II-2) while 10 to 20% are due to environmental factors214 (Level II-2) and noncompliance to medications, and 30% are of unknown aetiology.215-217 (Level III) Bacterial organisms\nthat have been isolated in various studies of AECOPD include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella\ncatarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae,\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus\naureus.217 (Level III), 218, 219 (Level II-3) Other precipitating factors include congestive heart failure, cold air and\npulmonary embolism.204 (Level III), 220 (Level II-2)\n8.5 Diagnosis and Assessment of Severity\nExacerbation of COPD is a clinical diagnosis which is supported by physical examination and\ninvestigations. Usual symptoms are increased dyspnoea, cough and production of sputum which\nmay become purulent. Non-specific symptoms such as lethargy, insomnia, sleepiness, depression\nand confusion may be present. Patients tend to underestimate their symptoms and underreport\nexacerbations221 (Level III) probably because they have poor understanding of their disease and the\nterm \u201cexacerbation\u201d.208 (Level III)\nAssessment of severity is based on history, physical examination and investigation findings.", "chunk_order": 34}

Severity of COPD should be assessed based on FEV1, previous exacerbations,\nhospital admissions especially history of admission into the intensive care unit (ICU) and receiving\ninvasive or non-invasive ventilation and the presence of complications of COPD. The history may\nalso help reveal possible cause(s) of and precipitating factors for the exacerbation and concomitant\nmedical illnesses. It is worth noting that anxiety and depression are common in COPD patients\nand in those with exacerbations.222 (Level II-2), 223 (Level III) History can also help rule out other differential\ndiagnoses (see 8.6). Physical examination includes checking:\n\u2022\nVital signs \u2013 temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate and rhythm and blood pressure. \u2022\nSigns of poorer prognosis \u2013 confusion, reduced conscious level, cachexia, respiratory distress,\ncyanosis and evidence of cor-pulmonale. \u2022\nEvidence of co-morbid conditions \u2013 cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases, diabetes\nmellitus and lung cancer. 8.5.2 Spirometry and Peak Flow Readings\nThese tests are difficult to be carried out by patients and to be interpreted during AECOPD.69 (Level\nIII) The measurements are not accurate and therefore their routine testing during the acute phase\nof AECOPD is not recommended. However, spirometry may be performed after the patient has\nrecovered either before hospital discharge or on a follow-up clinic visit especially if they have not\ndone it before. 8.5.3 Pulse Oximetry\nPulse oximetry is used to evaluate the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation (SpO2), need for supplemental\noxygen and response to treatment and to guide further management. Oxygen supplementation\nshould be given if SpO2 < 90%.69 (Level III) If arterial blood gas results are not readily available,\ncontrolled oxygen therapy using Venturi mask is recommended to avoid CO2 narcosis, aiming for\nSpO2 \u2265 90%. Morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure\nwhen the SpO2 is increased to above 93-95%.224 (Level III) However, pulse oximetry does not provide\ninformation about CO2 levels. 8.5.4 Arterial Blood Gas Measurement\nArterial blood gas measurement is useful as a tool to assess the severity of AECOPD. It is\nrecommended for patients attending the accident and emergency department and also in those\nwho are hospitalised. It should be performed in unwell patients despite them having good SpO2\nlevels. In patients who are breathing room air, respiratory failure is defined as PaO2 < 8.0 kPa\n(60 mmHg) and/or SaO2 < 90% with or without PaCO2 > 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg).", "chunk_order": 35}

The respiratory\nfailure and exacerbation is worse if there is respiratory acidosis [pH < 7.36 with hypercapnia\npCO2 6 - 8 kPa (45 \u2013 60 mmHg)] and is an indication for assisted (non-invasive or invasive\nventilation) ventilation.69 (Level III) It should also be considered in patients who do not respond to\ninitial medical treatment. 8.5.5 Sputum Gram Stain and Culture\nIn an outpatient setting, if an AECOPD is infectious in nature and does not respond to initial antibiotic\ntherapy, sputum culture and sensitivity should be performed.69 (Level III) Sputum examination should\nalso be performed on patients who are hospitalised 225(Level II-3) or whose chest radiographs show\nchanges suggestive of pneumonia. 8.5.6 Chest Radiograph\nA chest radiograph is useful to identify possible causes of the AECOPD (for example, pneumonia),\nalternative diagnoses that may mimic features of COPD (for example, heart failure and bronchiectasis)\nand possible complications (for example, lung cancer and pneumothorax). 8.5.7 Electrocardiogram (ECG)\nAn ECG is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia and right\nventricular hypertrophy. 8.5.8 Other Laboratory Tests\nFull blood count:\nA raised total white blood cell count may indicate underlying sepsis but a normal count does not\nrule it out. The presence of purulent sputum in AECOPD is enough to commence empirical antibiotic\ntherapy.226 (Level III) Polycythaemia and raised haematocrit levels suggest cor pulmonale. Anaemia\ncould be due to underlying chronic disease, malnutrition or blood loss. Renal profile, blood glucose and liver function test:\nBiochemical abnormalities may be present during AECOPD. These additional tests may reveal the\npresence of co-morbid conditions such as renal impairment, uncontrolled diabetes and malnutrition. 8.6 Differential Diagnoses\nNon-compliance to medications may mimic an exacerbation, therefore careful history taking is\nnecessary. If patients do not respond to standard therapy, they need to be reassessed to determine\nif they have other diagnoses that may imitate or aggravate their AECOPD such as:\n\u2022\nAsthma (may co-exist with COPD)\n\u2022\nBronchiectasis\n\u2022\nDiffuse parenchymal lung disease\n\u2022\nLung cancer\n\u2022\nPulmonary embolism\n\u2022\nPneumothorax\n\u2022\nHeart failure. Patients with advanced COPD often have several co-morbid conditions.128 (Level I), 204 (Level III)\n8.7 Managing Acute Exacerbations of COPD\nThe aims of management in exacerbations of COPD are to:\n1. Relieve symptoms and airflow obstruction\n2. Maintain adequate oxygenation\n3.

Table 8-1: Indications for Hospital Assessment or Admission for Acute Exacerbations of\nCOPD\n8.8 Home Management (Refer Figure 8-1)\n8.8.1 Bronchodilator Therapy\nInhaled bronchodilators improve airflow obstruction and reduce lung hyperinflation, thereby\nimproving dyspnoea. Short-acting inhaled \u03b22-agonists are preferred for treating AECOPD.76,196 (Level III),\n227 (Level I) The dosage and frequency of existing short-acting \u03b22-agonists therapy should be increased,\nfor example, salbutamol 200-400 \u03bcg or terbutaline 500 \u03bcg every 3-4 hours. Anticholinergic therapy\n(ipratropium bromide 40 \u03bcg 6 hourly) may be added if not yet in use, until the symptoms improve. 8.8.2 Systemic Corticosteroids\nSystemic corticosteroids should be used in addition to existing bronchodilator therapy in an AECOPD\nwith significant increase in dyspnoea or if the patient\u2019s baseline FEV1 is < 50% predicted. Systemic\ncorticosteroids have been shown to shorten recovery time, improve oxygenation and lung function\nand reduce treatment failure.228 (Level I) A dose of 30-40 mg prednisolone per day for 7-14 days is\nappropriate for most patients.69,204 (Level III) There is no advantage in prolonged corticosteroid therapy\nas the risk of side effects is significant. 8.8.3 Antibiotics\nThe use of antibiotics is discussed in 8.9.4 under hospital management. 8.9 Hospital Management (Refer Figure 8-2)\nThe initial management of a patient with an AECOPD in the emergency department is to provide\ncontrolled oxygen therapy and assessing the severity of the exacerbation to determine if the patient\ncan be treated in the emergency department or in the general ward. If the exacerbation is life\nthreatening, the patient should be admitted to a high dependency unit or the ICU. 8.9.1 Controlled Oxygen Therapy\nSupplemental oxygen therapy is considered the cornerstone of hospital treatment for an AECOPD. Oxygen therapy is given to maintain adequate oxygenation (PaO2 \u2265 8 kPa or \u2265 60 mmHg or SpO2\n\u2265 90%) without precipitating respiratory acidosis or worsening hypercapnia. Controlled oxygen\ntherapy should be given in the form of 24-28% oxygen via a Venturi mask if available to ensure\naccurate delivery of oxygen or 1-2 litres per minute of oxygen via nasal prongs.76,196 (Level III) Arterial\nblood gases should be checked 30-60 minutes later to ensure adequate oxygenation without CO2\nretention or acidosis.

Doctors need to be aware of interactions between aminophylline with various other drugs. 8.9.3 Systemic Corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids are effective treatments for AECOPD and are recommended as an addition to other\ntherapies in the hospital management of AECOPD in the absence of significant contraindications. Systemic corticosteroids improve lung function over the first 72 hours, shorten hospital stay\nand reduce treatment failure over the subsequent 30 days.231,232 (Level I) A dose of 30-40 mg of oral\nprednisolone daily for 7-14 days appears to be safe and effective. A study has shown that nebulised\ncorticosteroids may also be beneficial during AECOPD as an alternative to oral prednisolone in\nthe treatment of non-acidotic exacerbations of COPD.233 (Level I) Systemic corticosteroids should be\ndiscontinued after the acute episode as they are associated with significant side-effects. 8.9.4 Antibiotics\nBacterial lower respiratory tract infections, either primary or secondary, following an initial viral\ninfection are a common cause of AECOPD.", "chunk_order": 40}

SECTION 9\nTRANSLATING GUIDELINE ReCOMMENDATIONS TO THE CONTExT OF\nprimary CARE\n9.1 Introduction\nPrimary care provides the first point of contact for medical care delivery. Most patients with COPD\nare seen in primary care and it is therefore paramount that primary care physicians are adept\nin identifying, managing and preventing COPD. The best practice recommendations are detailed\nin Sections 1 to 8 and require effective translation of such recommendations to individual\ncircumstances in the primary care setting. In Malaysia, the main providers of primary care are the\npublic health centres, hospital-based primary care outpatient clinics and private general practice. The factors that are particularly pertinent in this context are described in this section. 9.2 Early Diagnosis\nEarly identification of patients at high risk is an important role for primary care doctors. Such\nidentification allows intervention to be taken such as smoking cessation, reduction of exposure\nto tobacco smoke as well as other risk factors such as occupational dusts, indoor and outdoor\npollution. Diagnosis should be made based on at risk individuals with symptoms of chronic cough, increased\nsputum production, or breathlessness, confirmed by spirometry. However, it is not recommended\nto use spirometry for the purpose of screening all adults for COPD. Therefore spirometry should be\nused as a diagnostic test for patients identified as at risk.245 (Level III)\n9.3 Smoking Cessation\nTo date, smoking cessation is the only effective way of preventing the development and reducing\nthe progression of COPD. Smoking cessation interventions, which include brief behavioural sessions\nand pharmacotherapy, are effective in making patients quit smoking.246 (Level III) All individuals with\nCOPD who still smoke will benefit from smoking cessation. 9.4 Spirometry\nIn primary care, COPD is diagnosed mainly on clinical grounds alone. However, the diagnosis can be\neasily overlooked and the condition therefore is frequently under-diagnosed. Spirometry is strongly advocated for the confirmation of diagnosis and the assessment of COPD\nseverity. The training in execution and correct interpretation of the spirometry is therefore necessary. In sites where spirometry is not available, referral to other centres where this test can be performed\nshould be arranged. Peak expiratory flow measurement may be considered where spirometry\nis not available.247 (Level III) However, while low peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) with little or no\nbronchodilator reversibility are consistent with COPD, but such findings can also be due to other\nlung diseases.", "chunk_order": 44}

Peak expiratory flow measurement may be considered where spirometry\nis not available.247 (Level III) However, while low peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) with little or no\nbronchodilator reversibility are consistent with COPD, but such findings can also be due to other\nlung diseases. Furthermore, PEFR is only reduced in advanced COPD. Therefore, it is important to\nrealise that spirometry is now the choice investigation for diagnosis and assessing severity. 9.5 Long-Term Management\nCOPD is a chronic disease. The role of primary care doctors include the following:\n\u2022\nEducation and counselling on COPD, and how it is different from asthma\n\u2022\nRaising awareness of COPD and that cigarette smoking cessation and avoidance of other risk\nfactors can help to prevent the development and progression of COPD\n\u2022\nPreventing exacerbations, such as by risk factor avoidance, vaccination and appropriate\npharmacotherapy\n\u2022\nCoordinating care with hospital-based specialists in issues of selection of therapies, prevention\nand treatment of exacerbations, treatment of co-morbidities and complications such as cor\npulmonale. Of particular relevance are the awareness of availability of pulmonary rehabilitation\nas well as the assessment of the need for and prescribing of LTOT\n\u2022\nDealing with problems in relation to home caregivers, such as coping with the disease, provision\nof support and dealing with end-of-life issues especially when the disease is advanced\n\u2022\nEncouraging patients to maintain the best level of physical activity. 9.6 When to Refer to Hospital-Based Specialists? Referral to a hospital-based specialist should be considered in the following situations:\n\u2022\nWhen the diagnosis is in doubt\n\u2022\nFor spirometry testing when such a facility is not available on site\n\u2022\nOnset of cor pulmonale\n\u2022\nAssessment and prescribing of LTOT\n\u2022\nWhen there is a rapid decline of FEV1 indicating severity of the disease\n\u2022\nPatient aged < 40 years in whom an underlying genetic predisposition such as alpha-1\nantitrypsin deficiency is suspected\n\u2022\nWhen access to certain drugs is a problem. Recommendations: Translating Guideline Recommendations to the Context of Primary Care\n1. Early identification of patients at risk for COPD and smoking cessation is important in\nprimary care. [Grade A]\n2. Spirometry is now strongly advocated for the confirmation of diagnosis and the assessment\nof COPD severity. [Grade A]\n3.
