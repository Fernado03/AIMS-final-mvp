The guideline should not override the responsibility of\nthe practitioners to make decision appropriate to the circumstances of\nthe individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and\ntheir families or guardians, taking into account the management options\navailable locally. CPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2023 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2027) or sooner if there is urgent need\nto do so. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

CPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\nii\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe following recommendations are highlighted by the CPG\nDevelopment Group as the key recommendations that answer the\nmain questions addressed in the CPG and should be prioritised for\nimplementation. a. Diagnosis\n\u2022 Patients with suspected geriatric hip fracture (GHF) should have plain\nradiographs according to standard views to confirm the diagnosis. \u2022 Those with occult GHF (presence of symptoms and signs of hip\nfractures despite normal plain radiographs) should have computed\ntomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging done to rule out\nthe fracture. b. Treatment\n\u2022 Analgesia should be prescribed adequately in geriatric hip fractures\n(GHF). \uf0a1 Peripheral nerve block may be considered if pain persists and\nresources are available. \u2022 Traction should not routinely be used in GHF. \u2022 Comprehensive geriatric assessment should be performed by the\nattending physician for all frail geriatric patients with hip fracture. \u2022 Oral nutritional support should be considered for all patients with\nGHF. \u2022 Patients with GHF should be given venous thromboembolism (VTE)\nprophylaxis (chemoprophylaxis and/or mechanical prophylaxis). \uf0a1 Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred choice for\nchemoprophylaxis peri-operatively. \uf0a1 Post-operatively VTE prophylaxis should be extended up to\n4 - 5 weeks with either an anti-coagulant (LMWH, direct oral\nanticoagulants, warfarin) or anti-platelet (aspirin only) according\nto individual deep vein thrombosis risk assessment. \u2022 Patients with GHF may be offered regional or general anaesthesia\nfor hip surgery according to individual\u2019s risk and benefit assessment. \uf0a1 Caution has to be taken to avoid hypotension intra-operatively. \u2022 Cemented stem should be offered for arthroplasty in displaced neck\nof femur fracture in geriatric patients. \u2022 Arthroplasty is the preferred choice in non-displaced fracture neck of\nfemur in geriatric patients for early full weight-bearing ambulation. \u2022 In GHF,\n\uf0a1 cephalomedullary nail (CMN) or extramedullary device may be\noffered for stable intertrochanteric fracture. \uf0a1 CMN is the preferred choice for unstable intertrochanteric fracture. CPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\niii\n\u2022 Surgery should be performed within 48 hours of admission in\nmedically stable GHF patients. \u2022 Analgesia should be provided peri-operatively in GHF. \uf0a1 Multimodal analgesia is the preferred choice. \u2022 Early mobilisation should be advocated as early as on post-operative\nday 1, e.g. sitting at the edge of the bed, unless contraindicated. \u2022 Rehabilitation should be offered to all patients with GHF postoperatively with the aim to improve mobility and functional recovery.", "chunk_order": 2}

Prevention\n\u2022 Geriatric population should be screened and assessed for falls risk. \uf0a1 Education about falls prevention should be offered accordingly. CPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these Clinical\nPractice Guidelines (CPG) were from the Ministry of Health (MoH) and\nthe Ministry of Higher Education. There was active involvement from\na multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. This is the first edition of an evidence-based CPG on the Management\nof Geriatric Hip Fracture (GHF). Literature search was carried out\nusing the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed\n(refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The search was\nlimited to literature published on humans, in English and last 15 years. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines\nwere searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field\nwere also contacted for studies related to the issues addressed. All\nsearches were conducted from 3 January 2022 to 28 February 2022. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of\nthe CPG development process, allowing any relevant papers published\nbefore 1 July 2023 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search\nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other guidelines on GHF as listed below:\n\u2022 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons - Management of\nHip Fractures in Older Adults Evidence-Based Clinical Practice\nGuideline (2021)\n\u2022 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - Hip fracture:\nManagement (2023)\nA total of five clinical questions were developed under four sections\n(diagnosis, risk factors, treatment and referral/follow-up). Members of\nthe DG were assigned individual questions within the sections (refer to\nAppendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 43 times\nthroughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved\nwere appraised by at least two DG members using Critical Appraisal\nSkill Programme checklist when applicable, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in DG meetings. All statements and\nrecommendations subsequently formulated were agreed upon by both\nthe DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC.", "chunk_order": 3}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States of\nAmerica (CDC) states that more than 300,000 people >65 years old are\nhospitalised for hip fractures yearly. More than 95% of these fractures\nare caused by falls and women account for three-quarters of all cases.1\nBased on 2004 - 2006 figures, the residual lifetime risk of hip fracture\n\u226550 years of age in Japan was estimated to be 5.6% for men and 20%\nfor women. The highest incidence of hip fractures from Asia had been\nreported from Singapore where the annual rates were 152 in men\nand 402 in women per 100,000 based on 1991 - 1998 data.2, level III In\nMalaysia, a comprehensive study on 56 public and private hospitals\nbetween 1996 to 1997 showed an overall incidence of hip fracture of\n90/100,000 population aged 50 years and above.3, level III\nIn an annual report by National Orthopedic Registry Malaysia (NORM)\nHip Fracture 2009, analysis on patient above 50 years old with GHF\nrevealed the incidence being highest among those in 70 - 79 years old\nage group which accounted 41.4% of all cases. The incidence was also\nhigher in women than men with the ratio of 2:1. In terms of ethnicity,\nmajority of cases were Chinese (44.5%) followed by Malays (40%) and\nIndians (13.9%).4, level III\nHip fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Individuals with hip fractures utilise significant healthcare resources\nas their hospital treatments consume large number of inpatient beddays. Majority of them require surgical fixation and many on discharge\nneed some form of support for daily living.5 - 6, level III Despite constituting\nonly 14% of osteoporosis-related fractures, hip fractures account for\nnearly 75% of the economic burden related to osteoporotic fracture.

Analgesics\nAdequate analgesia is key in GHF care and should be initiated at\nthe first encounter. Unfortunately, pain is often undertreated and may\nincrease the risk of other medical conditions including delirium.27, level II-2\nTreatment of pain is a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological modalities. The approach to management of acute pain\nis as stated in the Ministry of Health\u2019s \u201cPain as the 5th Vital Sign\u201d guideline\nwith strong emphasis on pain assessment and pharmacotherapy. World\nHealth Organization (WHO) analgesic pain ladder is used to guide for\npain management as choice of pharmacological agents in elderly is\nhighly individualised.28\nIn the Guidelines of Pain Management in the Elderly by MoH, the\nfollowings were recommended:29\n\u2022 paracetamol is considered as the first-line treatment for acute pain\nin older patients due to its effectiveness and good safety profile\n\u2022 opioid therapy may be considered for patients with moderate or\nsevere pain\n\u2022 selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors must be used with\ncaution in older people\n\u2022 non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be\ncautiously used if other safer treatments have not provided\nadequate pain relief\nIf pain persists and resources are available, regional nerve blocks\nwith ultrasound guidance can be administered to reduce pain and\nminimise sedation and other potential complications caused by opioids.

Refer to Appendix 3 on Principles of Analgesic Prescriptions in the\nElderly and the choice of analgesia that can be offered in GHF. b. Acute care and immobilisation on early admission\nGHF patients should be immobilised in bed by resting the affected\nlimb in a comfortable position to reduce pain. Traditionally this is done\nby applying skin traction over the affected leg while awaiting surgery. However, current evidence shows no advantages of skin traction as\nstated below. \u2022 A Cochrane systematic review of 11 RCTs found that routine use\nof traction for GHF did not appear to have any benefit with regards\nto pain relief nor analgesia use prior to surgery and reduced\nincidence of pressure sores.

Only in some instances, the traction may be\nrequired e.g. specific cases with peri-trochanteric fractures.14\nCPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\nRecommendation 3\n\u2022 Traction should not routinely be used in geriatric hip fracture. c. Early multi-disciplinary care\nOlder adults who sustain hip fractures are often of advanced age\nand, may have cognitive and functional impairment with multiple comorbidities. The risk of perioperative complications is also higher in this\ngroup of vulnerable individuals. Hence, multidisciplinary care involving\northopedic surgeons, geriatricians and others is important in improving\nthe outcomes of hip fracture surgery. The orthogeriatric care is a multidisciplinary care model with systematic\northopedic fracture management and geriatric optimisation of patients\nperi-operatively. The orthogeriatric input also involves multidisciplinary\ncomprehensive geriatric assessment by relevant health providers\nincluding allied health professionals to tailor treatment according to\npatient\u2019s needs. A prospective cohort study showed that orthogeriatric approach\nimproved hip fracture outcomes e.g. shorter time to surgery (OR=2.62,\n95% CI 1.40 to 4.91), shorter length of hospitalisation (p=0.045) and\nlower one-year mortality (OR=0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.96) compared\nwith standard orthopaedic care.34, level II-2\n\u2022\nComprehensive geriatric assessment\nComprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidisciplinary\ndiagnostic and treatment process that addresses the medical,\npsychosocial and functional limitations of the frail older patients.

The\nrecommendation formulated is based on extrapolation of evidences on\nother study population. CPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\nRecommendation 6\n\u2022 Patients with geriatric hip fracture should be given venous\nthromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis (chemoprophylaxis and/or\nmechanical prophylaxis)\n\uf0a1 Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred choice for\nchemoprophylaxis peri-operatively. \uf0a1 Post-operatively VTE prophylaxis should be extended up to\n4 - 5 weeks with either an anti-coagulant (LMWH, direct oral\nanticoagulants, warfarin) or anti-platelet (aspirin only) according\nto individual deep vein thrombosis risk assessment. \u2022\nPlan for post-operative care\nPatients with GHF usually have multiple co-morbidities, hence the postoperative care after their major hip surgery is an important consideration\nto optimise medical care. However, the decision to transfer these\npatients post-operatively to a critical care setting e.g. Intensive Care\nUnit (ICU) usually causes delay to the surgery because of limited\nresources in most healthcare institutions. Therefore, evidence plays an\nimportant role to identify patients who truly require ICU admission postoperatively that will benefit their clinical outcomes. A large retrospective cohort study in a critical care unit in the United\nKingdom investigated the epidemiology, critical care interventions\nand outcomes of patients with hip fracture. The significant reasons\nfor critical care admission (respiratory and cardiovascular support)\nand its timing (before surgery or two days after surgery) were major\ndeterminants of mortality. In fact, many patients admitted to this unit\nrequired no organ support but monitoring and, attention to oxygenation\nand fluid balance.55, level II-2\nAnother prospective cohort study identified that American Society of\nAnesthesiologists (ASA) status and prolonged ICU stay (>3 days) were\nindependent risk factors affecting 6- and 12-month mortality, and nursing\ncare dependency.56, level II-2 There was also no significant difference in\nearly post-operative mortality rates between patients admitted to ICU\nvs orthopaedic ward after surgery on ASA III patients operated under\nspinal anaesthesia when patients had been evaluated thoroughly in the\npre-operative period.57, level III\nIdentifying risk factors for ICU admission is important.", "chunk_order": 16}

Methods of anesthesia\nIn GHF patients, method of anesthesia is important in assisting a safe\nsurgery. The option for either regional or general anesthesia is often\ndebated as the method of choice for lowest mortality and post-operative\ncomplications. Two studies comprising of a Cochrane systematic review of moderate\nquality RCTs and a large RCT compared regional anesthesia using\nneuroaxial block and general anesthesia and, found no significant\ndifference in post-operative short-term mortality.

CPG on Management of Geriatric Hip Fracture\n8. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality\nhealthcare services based on the best and most recent available\nevidence applied to local scenario and expertise. Various factors and\nresource implications should be considered for the success of the\nuptake in the CPG recommendations. 8.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:\ni)\navailability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies)\nii) conferences and updates on or include topics on management of\nGHF including those involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian\nOrthopaedic Association and Malaysian Society of Geriatric\nMedicine)\niii) public awareness campaigns on geriatric populations (e.g. International Day of Older Persons)\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\ni)\ndifferent levels of care and wide variation in practice due to\nexpertise, facilities and financial constraints\nii) limited awareness and knowledge in management of GHF among\nhealthcare providers\niii) lack of awareness of hip fracture injury and its management by the\npublic\niv) lack of resources in maintaining National Orthopaedic Registry\nMalaysia Hip Fracture\n8.2 Potential Resource Implications\nThe resource implications in the management of GHF falls mainly on\nthe treatment part of the condition. The CPG recommends surgery to\nbe conducted within 48 hours of admission after physical consultation\nby orthopaedic team on medically stable GHF patients. However, this\nmay not be feasible in view of optimisation of patients, availability of\noperating theatre and arrangement to acquire the suitable implant. In\nthe unstable intertrochanteric fracture, CMN has been recommended\nbut cost is the hindering factor in obtaining it.", "chunk_order": 28}

Timing of medication administration is important. \u2022 Severe, episodic pain requires treatment of a rapid onset of\naction and short duration. \u2022 For continuous pain, regular analgesia is the most effective,\npossibly using modified release formulations. 2. Start with a low dose single agent at a time, followed by low\nincremental dose titration. 3. Allow adequate intervals for assessment of the effect before\nconsidering another agent. 4. Combination therapy using agents with different mechanisms of\naction may have synergistic effects to provide greater pain relief\nwith fewer side effects than higher doses of a single agent. 5. Consider the use of non-pharmacological strategies, e.g\nphysiotherapy\nand\ncognitive\nbehavioural\napproaches,\nin\ncombination with medication. 6. Treatment should be monitored regularly and adjusted if required\nto improve effectiveness and minimise side effects. 7. On choosing an analgesic agent, co-morbidity, contraindications\nand possibilities of drug-disease and drug-drug interactions should\nbe considered.
