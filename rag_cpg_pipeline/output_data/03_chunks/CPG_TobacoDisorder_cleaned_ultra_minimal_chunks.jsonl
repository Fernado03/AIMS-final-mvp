In this\nupdate, the CPG have been renamed as Clinical Practice Guidelines on Treatment\nof Tobacco Use Disorder 2016. This update is meant to be as guidelines for clinical\npractice, based on the best available evidence at the time of development. Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily guarantee the best clinical\noutcome in every case. This CPG is not meant as a substitute for clinical judgement\nand clinicians are recommended to individualize the treatment strategy for every\nsmoker. Every healthcare provider is responsible for the management of his/her\nunique patient based on the clinical picture such as nicotine addiction level,\npresented by the patient and the management options available locally. This CPG will be reviewed every four years or sooner and updated with the\nmost recent development as the need arises. Upon the time for next review, the\nCPG Secretariat will inform the Chairperson of the CPG Committee Members, who\nwill initiate discussion on revision of the CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be\nformed and the latest systematic review methodology will be employed.

We have now reached a point where the majority of smokers are aware that\nsmoking is not good for their health but have difficulty quitting. Globally and\nnationally, the majority of current smokers would like to give up smoking. As a\nparty to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Malaysia\nis committed to strengthen the smoking cessation services, as stipulated in Article\n14 FCTC. Hence, this Clinical Practice Guideline was developed to ensure\nsmokers gets the latest evidenced-based treatment there are to ensure higher\nquit smoking success rate. Helping our fellow Malaysian smokers to beat their\nnicotine addiction is beneficial for both short and long-term personal and national\ngains. Last but not least, I would like to thank the CPG committee members and\nmany others that have contributed to the development of this CPG. Towards a healthy and smokefree Malaysian generation! (DATUK SERI DR. S. SUBRAMANIAM)\nMinister of Health Malaysia\nFOREWORD\nNicotine addiction is one of the hardest addictions to break but nonetheless, every\nyear, many smokers managed to break away from this addiction. However, a\nnational survey in 2016 revealed that nearly 80% of former smokers quit unaided,\nwithout any professional intervention. This figure is worrying, as studies\nrepeatedly show that quitting unaided yield the lowest success rate of being\nsmokefree, hence many smokers needed 7-8 attempts before successfully\nbecoming ex-smokers. Most government Health Clinics and major hospitals in Malaysia have smoking\ncessation services and now, with the introduction of mQuit Services, this service\nis also available in the private sector, through some community pharmacies,\ngeneral practices or other institutions. Our challenge now is how to attract fellow\nMalaysians who smoke to visit our smoking cessation services and deliberate on\nhow they can be guided to quit properly. Smoking cessation services should\nentice as many smokers as possible, who are otherwise coming to health care\nfacilities for other health services anyway. A national survey conducted in 2016 among Malaysian adolescents aged 10 \u2013 19\nyears old (Tobacco and Electronic Cigarette Survey among Malaysian Adolescent\n\u2013 TECMA) found that an alarming 78.7% of ever smokers had their first cigarette\nbefore the age of 14 years old. The same study also show that 28.5% of the\ncurrent adolescent smokers have already developed low nicotine dependence. More often than not, their nicotine dependence will only get stronger by the time\nthey enter their working life.", "chunk_order": 2}

More often than not, their nicotine dependence will only get stronger by the time\nthey enter their working life. Therefore, it is high time for healthcare providers to promote and attract young\nadult smokers to think about quitting and to at least discuss about quitting with the\nhelp of healthcare professionals. Our data showed that young adults are the least\nlikely to enquire about quitting, while their tobacco disorder is probably easier to\ntreat in comparison to older and more mature smokers. Our smoking cessation\nservices must do more to appeal to younger Malaysian smokers to come to the\nservices. Malaysia is committed towards our obligations with the World Health Organisation\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). We are also\ncommitted to achieve the WHO Global Non-Communicable Diseases target which\nis to achieve smoking prevalence of 15% or less by the year 2025. In the\nmeantime, the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030 requires parties to\nstrengthen their implementation of FCTC activities, including helping smokers to\nquit smoking. I would like to congratulate the CPG Development Group for updating the older\nCPG of Treatment of the Tobacco Use and Dependence to the current CPG on\nTreatment of Tobacco Use Disorder. I hope that all health care providers will\nutilise this Clinical Guidelines to provide safe and effective smoking cessation\nservices for smokers to quit successfully. Together, we can help to further\nimproving the health of our nation! Yours sincerely,\n(DATUK DR NOOR HISHAM BIN ABDULLAH)\nDirector General of Health\nMinistry of Health Malaysia\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nTobacco use is recognized as the main cause of premature and preventable death\nin our country. It is estimated that 20,000 deaths in Malaysia are attributed to\nsmoking annually. Tobacco dependency does not only cause physical withdrawal,\nit also causes lifelong addiction. Hence, due recognition should be given to it as\na chronic disease. Malaysia has a high prevalence of smokers especially among\nthe males and adolescents. However, despite the high prevalence of tobacco use,\nhealthcare providers are not well trained to manage this problem effectively. Furthermore, health care providers lack the knowledge and awareness that\ntreating tobacco dependence is more cost effective as compared to treating\ntobacco related diseases. Since the launch of the Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on Treatment of\nTobacco Use and Dependence 2003 by the Ministry of Health, there have been\nseveral new evidences based developments in the smoking cessation services\nwhich are highlighted in this update.", "chunk_order": 3}

Since the launch of the Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on Treatment of\nTobacco Use and Dependence 2003 by the Ministry of Health, there have been\nseveral new evidences based developments in the smoking cessation services\nwhich are highlighted in this update. For example, there are changes or\nintroduction of new cessation pharmaceutical aids, combination use of\npharmaceutical aids, new scientific evidence of behavioural therapies and now\nthe emergence of electronic nicotine and non-nicotine devices, such as Vape. The\napproach towards tobacco use or nicotine addiction has also changed whereby it\nis now considered a medical condition that requires medical attention. Hence, it is\nvery timely for the 2003 CPG to be updated to the CPG of Tobacco Use and\nDisorder 2016. The objective of this CPG remains the same. It is to provide the latest and updated\ntreatment protocols to assist health care providers in managing tobacco use and\ndependence effectively. This guideline was based on a combination of two methods. The first part was\nwhere three leading and prominent international CPGs on tobacco cessation were\nused as references and the second was inclusion of the latest literature based on\na systematic search of the evidence. All recommendations in this CPG are\ngraded based on the appropriate level of evidence and are specific and\nunambiguous. The health benefits, adverse effects and risks of all recommended\npharmacological agents are detailed in tables throughout this document. The\noverall treatment guideline is provided in a clinical pathway format. Furthermore,\nthe effectiveness and health benefits derived from each recommendation in this\nCPG are taken into consideration. Both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches towards achieving\nsmoking cessation are equally important and the skills involved must be grasped\nby cessation providers. There are several standardised behavioural approaches\nsuch as 5A, 5R and STAR to help cessation providers to assist their clients. When\nthese behavioural approaches are combined with pharmacological intervention,\nthe quit rate is further increased. Combination pharmacological interventions\nwhich might include the combination of NRTs or with a non-NRT medication can\nfurther increase the success rate. Therefore, the treatment approach should be\ntailored to the individual smoker and care be given when treating certain special\npopulations. It is hoped that clinicians and other allied healthcare providers will adopt this\nevidence \u2013 based guideline to maximize the success rate of tobacco cessation in\ntheir respective services. This CPG, however, is not meant as a substitute for\nclinical judgement and clinicians are recommended to individualize their treatment\nstrategies where appropriate. Evaluation of this CPG would include an assessment of the number of smoking\ncessation services and the outcome of smokers treated throughout Malaysia.", "chunk_order": 4}

Studies to look at improvement in standard of practice regarding smoking\ncessation treatment will be conducted. Local research and analysis of Malaysian\nsmoking and tobacco use scenario should be encouraged to improve our\nunderstanding towards improving the smoking cessation in our country. GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nThis guideline is based on a combination of two methods; firstly, three clinical\npractice guidelines (CPGs) as mentioned below were used as main references\nand secondly, latest literature review was incorporated in the development of this\nguideline. The main references were from:\nA. Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence 2008, US Department of Health\nand Human services (Citation 2008) . B. The New Zealand Guidelines for Helping People to Stop Smoking. Wellington: Ministry of Health 2014. C. CAN-ADAPTT. Canadian Smoking Cessation Clinical Practice Guideline,\nToronto, Canada: Canadian Action Network for the Advancement,\nDissemination and Adoption of Practice-informed Tobacco Treatment,\nCentre for Addiction and Mental Health 2011. GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these CPG were from the\nMinistry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Higher Education, private medical hospital\nand Non-Governmental Organisation. There was active involvement of a\nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG\ndevelopment. A literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases:\nGuidelines International Network (G-I-N); Medline via Ovid, PubMed and\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) (refer to Appendix 1 for\nExample of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria are all literature on treatment\non tobacco use disorder regardless of study designs. The search was limited to\nliterature published in the last 15 years, humans and English. In addition, the\nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further\nidentify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify\nrelevant studies. In certain situations, pivotal papers beyond the scope of search\nwere used in the CPG. All searches were conducted from 30th July 2014 to 30th\nMarch 2016. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the\nend of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published\nbefore 30th June 2016 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence\npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.", "chunk_order": 5}

Reference was also made to other CPG on treatment of Tobacco use disorder\nsuch as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - Smoking and\ntobacco: smoking cessation in mental health services, recommendation for all\npatients with mental illness who smoke from European Psychiatric Association\n(EPA). The CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research\nand Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. A total of 17 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members\nof the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. (Refer to\nAppendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The CPG committee members met 14 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members\nusing Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables\nand further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and recommendations\nformulated after that were agreed upon by the DG. Where evidence was\ninsufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the DG. Any\ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely\non the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, with local\npractices taken into consideration. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It was\nalso posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from any interested\nparties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for\nCPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval. This CPG has been developed to serve as a useful tool for doctors and other\nhealth professionals and students in Malaysia to treat tobacco use in various\nsettings, including hospitals, clinics or pharmacies. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE SCALE AND GRADES OF RECOMMENDATION\nThe literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/Canadian\nPreventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of\nrecommendation was based on the US Government Agency for Health Care\nPolicy and Research (AHCPR) ABC Grade of Recommendation.", "chunk_order": 6}

In\nMalaysia, smoking kills 20,000 Malaysians every year and will increase to 30,000\nby the year 2020 if the pattern of smoking does not change. Malaysia is a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO\nFCTC) since its enforcement in September 2005. Article 14 of the WHO FCTC\ndemands that \u201ceach Party shall develop and disseminate appropriate,\ncomprehensive and integrated guidelines based on scientific evidence and best\npractices, taking into account national circumstances and priorities, and shall take\neffective measures to promote cessation of tobacco use and adequate treatment\nfor tobacco dependence\u201d.

Strengthening tobacco cessation is core to the \u2018O - Offer\nhelp to quit tobacco use\u2019 component of the MPOWER strategy of the WHO FCTC\n2, Level I. Malaysia is committed to achieve its WHO Global NCD Target 2025, which is to\nreduce national smoking prevalence by 30% from the baseline in 2011. There are\ntwo main strategies to achieve this, which are to reduce smoking initiation among\nyouths and to help existing smokers to beat their nicotine addiction. A National Strategic Plan on Tobacco Control has been developed by the Ministry\nof Health in 2015, incorporating the MPOWER strategy for co-ordinating tobacco in\nMalaysia3, Level III. Strengthening tobacco cessation services is given priority, with\ndevelopment of a standardised services across the public and private practices \u2013\n\u2018the mQuit Services\u2019 as one the activities. This Clinical Practice Guideline is\nessential for delivery of uniformed tobacco cessation services through the mQuit\nServices. Nicotine is highly addictive and some researchers have placed nicotine dependence\nas comparable to the dependence caused by opiates, cocaine, or other illicit drugs4,\nLevel I. Effective pharmacologic and counselling strategies are now the pillars of\ntobacco cessation programmes, and taken in combination can achieve the highest\nrates of smoking cessation5, Level III. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims\nprimarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive\nsymptoms while counselling or behavioural support aims to boost or support\nmotivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people\u2019s capacity to implement\ntheir plans to avoid smoking6, Level III. Most smokers believe that stopping smoking is purely a matter of willpower and\nremain unaware of effective treatments to promote quitting. It is important that\nhealth care providers whom often treat smokers to be familiar with available\ntherapies to educate patients of their options for smoking cessation. 2.0\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF TOBACCO USE\nThe trend of current cigarette smoking among Malaysian adults is summarised as\nper Table 1 below. Overall, there is a slight downtrend of prevalence of cigarette\nsmoking in Malaysia and this trend is more considerable among males. Table 1: Trend of smoking among adults (\u226518 years) in Malaysia 1996-2015\nStudy year\n1996\n2006\n2011\n2015\nOverall prevalence (%)\n24.7\n22.8\n24.6\n24.0\nMale prevalence (%)\n49.1\n48.8\n46.6\n45.1\nFemale prevalence (%)\n3.5\n1.9\n1.1\n1.4\nAdapted from Tee et al. 20167\nThe overall prevalence of smoked any tobacco products for Malaysians aged 15\nyear old and above was 22.6%; of which 20.1% smoked manufactured cigarette,\n2.3% smoked hand-rolled cigarettes and 0.2% smoked other smoked tobacco8, Level\nIII.", "chunk_order": 11}

A vast majority of Malaysian smokers were aware of harmful effects of smoking and\n78% of these smokers had plans to quit at some point in the future, with 29% having\nplans to quit in the next six months9, Level II-3. Among the Malaysian youths, the 2009 Global Youth Tobacco Survey found that\n19.5% of 13 to 15 year olds use some form of tobacco products with 18.2% smoking\ncigarettes and 9.5% using other tobacco products. In 2016, the prevalence of\ntobacco use among adolescents age 13-15 year old in Malaysia has reduced to\n14.8%10, Level III. 3.0\nASSESSMENT OF TOBACCO SMOKING\nThe first step in treating tobacco use disorder is to identify tobacco users. The\nidentification of smokers itself increases rates of clinician intervention. Hospitals\nprovide a good setting to implement smoking cessation intervention. However\nissues of accessibility and availability of the medication, dedicated staff, operating\ndays and equipment have to be solved11, 12. Effective identification of tobacco use\nstatus not only opens the door for successful interventions (e.g., clinician advice\nand treatment), but also guides clinicians to identify appropriate interventions based\non patients\u2019 tobacco use status and willingness to quit. The Guideline recommends\nthat all health care providers use the opportunity at every encounter to assess and\nintervene all patients. The assessments are to look for:\nLevel of addiction (using Modified Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Cigarette Dependence\nQuestionnaire) (See Appendix 3) and smoking status verified with carbon monoxide\n(CO) in expired breath air. Exhaled CO was proved to be a useful tool in predicting\nnicotine dependence and to motivate smokers to quit13, Level I. Screening for current or past tobacco use will result in four possible responses:\nA. The patient uses tobacco and is now willing to make a quit attempt;\nB. The patient uses tobacco but is now not willing to make a quit attempt;\nC. The patient once used tobacco but has since quit;\nD. The patient never regularly used tobacco. 4.0\nCLINICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR TOBACCO USE DISORDER\nThere are two types of clinical intervention depending on the intensity of intervention\nand level of service provided. They are:\ni. Brief clinical intervention\nii. Intensive clinical intervention\n4.1\nBrief Clinical Intervention for Tobacco Use Disorder\n4.1.1 For All Smokers\nBrief clinical intervention by the physician increases quit rates effectively14, Level I.

It\nis vital to change clinical culture and practice patterns to ensure that every patient\nwho uses tobacco is identified and offered treatment. The five major steps (5 A\u2019s) for intervention are described below and summarised\nin Table 1. The strategies are designed to be brief and minimal health care\nprovider\u2019s time is required15,16,17. These brief opportunistic advices typically involve asking patients about their current\nsmoking, advising them to stop, offering assistance either by providing further\nadvice, a referral to a specialist service or recommendation of or a prescription for\npharmacotherapy or arranging a follow up wherever it is appropriate. The focus of\nthis opportunistic advice is to increase smokers\u2019 motivation to quit in improving\nsuccess rate of quitting18. This brief intervention has been proven to increase overall\ntobacco abstinence rates regardless he or she is referred to an intensive\nintervention19,20 Level I,21 Level III. The steps involved in the delivery of brief intervention include:\nStep 1: Ask about tobacco smoking\nALL patients should be asked about their smoking status and the findings should\nbe documented in the patient\u2019s notes. This should be delivered opportunistically\nduring routine consultations to all smokers regardless whether they are seeking help\nto stop smoking. For people who smoke or have recently stopped smoking, the\nsmoking status should be checked and updated at every visit to prevent relapse. Systems should be in place in all health care settings to ensure that smoking status\nis accurately documented at every visit (20, Level I; 6, Level I)\nStep 2: Advice to quit\nAdvice to quit should be given clearly to all patients found to be smoking. Studies\nhave shown that advise by health care providers (medical, dental, pharmacist,\nnurses etc.) increases rates of abstinence. There is a strong dose-response\nrelationship between the session length of person-to-person contact and\nsuccessful treatment outcomes20, Level I. Multiple efforts by health care providers can increase these rates further. Every\ntobacco user should be offered at least a brief intervention which consists of brief\ncessation advice from the health care providers. However, intensive interventions\nare more effective than brief interventions and should be used whenever possible\nas smokers\u2019 motivation, beliefs and feeling about smoking and quitting is always\nconflicting18, Level III. Face to face treatment delivered for four or more sessions\nappears especially effective in increasing abstinence rates22, Level I. Therefore, if\nfeasible, treatment providers should strive to meet four or more times with\nindividuals quitting tobacco use. Health care workers should be provided with appropriate training to enable them to\nprovide brief advice.", "chunk_order": 13}

Therefore, if\nfeasible, treatment providers should strive to meet four or more times with\nindividuals quitting tobacco use. Health care workers should be provided with appropriate training to enable them to\nprovide brief advice. This training should include providing the health care worker\nwith information on available evidence-based smoking cessation treatments19. Step 3: Assess willingness to make a quit attempt\nHealth care providers involved with tobacco treatment should assess the\nwillingness to begin treatment to quit. Though there is a lack of evidence for greater effectiveness of stage based\napproaches23, Level I, stages of change model provides a useful framework to help\nhealth care providers to identify smokers and assist smokers in quitting24, Level III. There is some evidence that the likelihood of success in an attempt to quit is\nunrelated to the smoker\u2019s expressed interest in quitting in the period leading up to\nthe attempt \u2013 unplanned attempts to quit are as likely (or even more likely) to be as\nsuccessful as planned attempts25, Level III; 26, Level III. Thus, there is benefit in\nencouraging all smokers to consider quitting whenever the opportunity arises20, Level\nI. Step 4: Assist in quit attempt\nAll patients should be assisted to quit. Brief advice as short as 30 seconds and selfhelp material have been shown to help14, Level I. Brief advice (3-5 minutes) is effective\nand there is a dose response in treatment provision. Setting a quit date has been shown to be effective. Ideally the quit date should be\nwithin 2 weeks on assessment to quit. \u2022\nIndividual, group and telephone counselling approaches are effective and\nshould be used in smoking cessation interventions. Smoking cessation\ninterventions that are delivered in multiple approaches increase abstinence\nrates and should be encouraged. Studies have shown that individual\ncounselling resulted in higher abstinence rates as compared to group or\nphone counselling and self-help27, Level II-1; 22, Level I. There are two forms of\ntelephone counselling which is the \u2018proactive counselling\u2019 and \u2018reactive\ncounselling. In proactive counselling, smokers receive calls from healthcare\nproviders according to a pre-agreed schedule. In \u2018reactive counselling\u2019,\nsmokers calls a helpline seeking help or advice. Proactive services,\ncompared to reactive services, have been more widely evaluated as they can\nbe more easily controlled. Studies have recommended that proactive\ntelephone counselling as one of the formats for delivering behavioural\ncounselling20, Level I; 28, Level I; 29, Level I. For hospitalised patients, a study has\nshown that high intensive telephone follow-up (4 calls at 48 hours post\ndischarge, 7, 21, 90 days) was more effective than low intensive follow-up (1\ncall at 48 hours post discharge) in addition to 30 minutes counselling30, Level I.", "chunk_order": 14}

Step 5: Arrange follow up\nHealth care providers wanting to do more intensive counselling will require further\nappropriate training. Health care providers who are not confident in providing\ncounselling interventions can still assist patients wanting to quit by arranging\nreferrals to services that can assist. Patients who are attempting to quit are at high risk of relapsing. Continuous\nabstinence is achieved when the patient has not smoked for at least 6 months. The\nhighest risk of relapse is within the first 8 days of quitting. Hence the support has to\nbe given the utmost importance in the first week of quitting cigarette smoking. Evidence has shown that abstinence of 12 months follow up is a good indicator for\nlong term abstinence31. The evidence suggests that multiple treatment sessions increase smoking\nabstinence rate and its effectiveness. More intensive interventions (more than eight\nsessions in six months) may produce enhanced abstinence rate. However, these\ninterventions may have limited reach (affect fewer smokers) and may not be feasible\nin some primary care settings20, Level I. The steps recommended by the NCSCT for evidence-based behaviour change\ntechniques to assist health care providers in managing smokers who seek clinic\nhelp to quit smoking are32, Level I:-\nSession 1: Pre-quit Assessment (1 or 2 weeks prior to Quit Date)\nSession 2: Quit Date\nSession 3: 1 week post Quit Date\nSession 4: 2 weeks post Quit Date\nSession 5: 3 weeks post Quit Date\nSession 6: 4 weeks post Quit Date\n(See Appendix 4 for details)\nTable 2: The \u201c5 A\u2019s\u201d for brief intervention\n1. Ask about tobacco use:\n\u2022 Identify and document tobacco use status for every patient at every visit,\nincluding the adolescents. \u2022 Where appropriate, ask the caretaker of the patient about tobacco use or\nexposure to tobacco smoke. What needs to be done? Expand the vital signs to include tobacco use or use an alternative universal\nidentification system (e.g. stickers on patient charts). 2. Advise to quit:\nIn a clear, strong and personalized manner urge every tobacco user to quit. Advice should be:\n\u2022 Clear\u2014\"I think it is important for you to quit smoking now and I can help\nyou.\" \"Cutting down while you are ill is not enough.\"\n\u2022 Strong\u2014\"As your clinician, I need you to know that quitting smoking is the\nmost important thing you can do to protect your health now and in the\nfuture.", "chunk_order": 15}

Assess willingness to make a quit attempt:\nIs the tobacco user willing to make a quit attempt at this time? \u2022 If the patient is willing to make a quit attempt at this time, provide\nassistance. \u2022 If the patient will participate in an intensive treatment, deliver such a\ntreatment or refer to an intensive intervention. \u2022 If the patient clearly states he or she is unwilling to make a quit attempt at\nthis time, provide a motivational intervention built around the \u201c5 R\u2019s\u201d:\nrelevance, risks, rewards, roadblocks, and repetition. (Refer to section\nSmokers unwilling to quit, page 32)\nIf the patient is a member of a special population (e.g., adolescent, pregnant\nsmoker), consider providing additional information (refer to section Special\nPopulation, page 39). 4. Assist in quit attempt:\n\u2022 For the patient willing to make a quit attempt, use counselling with\npharmacotherapy (when indicated) to help him or her quit. Preparations for quitting: (STAR)\n\u2022 Set a quit date. Ideally, the quit date should be within 2 weeks. Reduce\nthe number of cigarettes gradually before the set date. \u2022 Tell family, friends, and co-workers about quitting and request\nunderstanding and support. Also, help patient obtain extra-treatment\nsocial support from self-help groups. Other smokers in the household. Patients should encourage household members to quit with them or not\nsmoke in their presence to minimize risk of treatment failure and exposure\nto second-hand smoking. \u2022 Anticipate challenges to planned quit attempt, particularly during the\ncritical first few weeks. These include nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Discuss challenges/triggers and how patient will successfully overcome\nthem. Provide patients with problem solving/skills training. \u2022 Remove tobacco products from his or her environment. Prior to quitting,\navoid smoking in places where a lot of patient\u2019s time is spent (e.g., work,\nhome, car). \u2022 Provide a supportive healthcare environment while encouraging the\npatient in his or her quit attempt. \u2022 Abstinence.

Table 3: Components of an intensive tobacco dependence intervention\nAssessment\n\u2022 Assessments should determine whether tobacco\nusers are willing to make a quit attempt using an\nintensive treatment programme. \u2022 Other assessments can provide information useful in\ncounselling (e.g., stress level, dependence). Programme\nclinicians\n\u2022 Multiple types of clinicians are effective and should be\nused. \u2022 One counselling strategy would be to have a\nmedical/health care clinician deliver a strong\nmessage to quit and information about health risks\nand benefits, and recommend and prescribe\nmedications recommended in this Guideline update. \u2022 Nonmedical clinicians could then deliver additional\ncounselling interventions. Programme\nintensity\nThere is evidence of a strong dose-response relation;\ntherefore, when possible, the intensity of the programme\nshould be:\n\u2022 Session length \u2013 longer than 10 minutes\n\u2022 Number of sessions \u2013 4 or more\nProgramme format\n\u2022 Either individual or group counselling may be used. \u2022 Telephone counselling also is effective and can\nsupplement treatments provided in the clinical setting. \u2022 Use of self-help materials and cessation Web sites is\noptional. \u2022 Follow up interventions should be scheduled.

NRT helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by\nreplacing the nicotine from cigarettes. NRT is available as skin patches that deliver\nnicotine slowly, and chewing gum, inhalers/inhalators, oral mouth sprays,\nmicrotabs, nasal sprays and lozenges, all of which deliver nicotine to the brain more\nquickly than from skin patches, but less rapidly than from smoking cigarettes. Evidence shows that all forms of NRT made it more likely that a person's quit\nattempt to succeed. The chances of stopping smoking were increased by 50 to 70%. The evidence suggests no overall difference in effectiveness between different\nforms of NRT33, Level I. NRT products work with or without additional counselling. NRT products do not\nneed a doctor\u2019s prescription as they are Group C medications under the Poisons\nAct 1952. Heavier smokers usually need higher doses of NRT. People who use\nNRT during a quit attempt are likely to further increase their chances of success by\nusing a combination of two NRT products. Nicotine patch with short-acting nicotinereplacement therapy (e.g., NRT gum) appears safe and increases abstinence\nversus nicotine-replacement monotherapy (OR=1.63, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.03) 34, Level I. Data suggest that starting to use NRT patches shortly before the planned quit date\nmay increase the chance of success22, Level I. Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin\nirritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and lozenge. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks. Varenicline, a specific nicotine receptor partial agonist, may help people stop\nsmoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract\nwithdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction\n(acting as an antagonist). The odds of quitting were between two and three times\nhigher with varenicline than that with placebo. Varenicline was about 50% more\neffective than any single formulation of NRT (patches, gum, lozenges, and inhalers),\nbut similar in efficacy to combining two types of NRT33, Level I. The pooled RR from high-quality evidence for continuous or sustained abstinence\nat six months or longer for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.24\n(95% CI 2.06 to 2.43). Varenicline at lower or variable doses was also shown to be\neffective, with an RR of 2.08 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78).

The number needed to\ntreat with varenicline for an additional beneficial outcome, based on the weighted\nmean control rate, is 11 (95% CI 9 to 13)35, Level I. The most commonly reported adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was\nmostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Serious adverse\nevents (SAE) such as neuropsychiatric occurring during or after active treatment\nsuggests there may be a 25% increase in the chance of SAEs among people using\nvarenicline (RR=1.25; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.49)35, Level I. \u2022 NRT provides some of the nicotine that a person would have otherwise\nreceived from tobacco, and in doing so reduces the person\u2019s urge to smoke. \u2022 All NRT products roughly double a person\u2019s chance of stopping compared with\na placebo. \u2022 People should use NRT for at least eight to twelve weeks. \u2022 Using two NRT products (for example, patches and gum) is more effective than\nusing one. \u2022 People who need NRT for longer than 12 weeks can continue to use it. \u2022 If the person is not ready to stop smoking straight away, NRT can be used to\nhelp reduce their smoking before they stop. \u2022 There are four different NRT products available in Malaysia, including the\npatch, gum, lozenges and inhalator. However, subsequent observational cohort studies and meta-analyses have not\nconfirmed these fears. The findings of the largest trial to date on varenicline and\nbupropion in comparison with NRT and placebo in subjects with and without\npsychiatric disorders do not support a causal link between varenicline and\nneuropsychiatric disorders, including suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour. 36,(Anthenelli et al. 2016 Level I).

The side effects of bupropion include insomnia, dry mouth and nausea and rarely\n(1:1000) seizures and perhaps psychiatric problems, but the last is unclear.

Cost may become the predominant factor when the smoker is paying\nout-of-pocket, as in buying the medication from a community pharmacist or private\nquit smoking cessation service. Suitability factors (e.g. nature of job, preference,\netc.) should be considered to fit the medication to the lifestyle of the smoker. For\ninstance, the NRT patch is the most discreet among the NRT products since it can\nbe worn under the clothing. Conversely, some smokers prefer an oral form of the\nNRT products (e.g., gum, lozenge or inhaler) since it addresses the hand and/or\nmouth fixation, to a certain extent, associated with smoking.

Healthcare providers should discuss the pertinent details of the available\nmedications with each smoker (Tables 1 to 6). Some smokers may prefer to sample\na few preparations before finding the one most suitable for them. NRT preferences\nbased on explanations has been shown to change after sampling. NRT sampling\nmay also lead to better choice and treatment compliance38, Level II-2). Prior successful experience (sustained abstinence with the medication) suggests\nthat the medication may be helpful to the patient in a subsequent quit attempt,\nespecially if the patient finds the medication to be tolerable and/or easy to use.

For example, combining the\nnicotine patch with a self - administered form of nicotine replacement therapy (either\nthe nicotine gum or nicotine inhaler) is more efficacious than a single form of\nnicotine replacement, and patients should be encouraged to use such combined\ntreatments if they are unable to quit using a single type of first-line\npharmacotherapy42 Level I; 43; 44. Current literature indicates that combination therapy is statistically better than\nmonotherapy in smoking cessation treatment. Adverse effects and adherence to\ncombination therapy are similar to monotherapy and placebo45. Combination therapy may be most useful for those smokers at highest risk of\nrelapse, e.g. heavy smokers, smokers who have relapsed multiple times, or\nsmokers with psychiatric co-morbidities.

It\nis postulated that with less nicotine reaching the brain immediately after smoking,\nthe vicious cycle between smoking and nicotine related gratification will be broken. (RACGP 2011). There are no nicotine vaccines currently licensed for public use,\nbut there are a few in development. Studies have not shown that vaccines help\npeople to stop smoking in the long term. Trials showed nicotine vaccines to be\ngenerally safe, with most side effects being mild or moderate, including flu-like\nsymptoms. There were no trials testing whether nicotine vaccines helped keep\npeople who had stopped smoking from starting to smoke again47, Level I. 4.3.3 Combination of pharmacological agents with behavioural intervention\nThere is high quality evidence that using a combination of behavioural support and\nmedication increases the chances of successfully quitting after at least six months. Combined results of these studies suggest that the chance of success is increased\nby 70 to 100 percent compared to just brief advice or support. There was some\nevidence that the effect tended to be larger when participants were recruited in\nhealthcare settings. There was no clear evidence that providing more contact\nincreased the number of people who quit smoking at six months or longer48, Level I. 4.4\nOther Treatments and Interventions\nThere are many other treatments and interventions that people may ask about or\nwant to use, such as hypnosis and acupuncture. However, there is evidence that\nsome of these interventions do not help people to stop smoking, and for other\ninterventions, there is insufficient evidence as to their effectiveness. 4.4.1 Hypnosis\nThere is evidence that hypnosis does not improve long-term abstinence rates over\nany intervention providing the same amount of time and attention to the\nparticipant49, Level I. 4.4.2 Acupuncture\nAcupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy and electrostimulation do not improve\nlong-term abstinence rates over that of a placebo effect50, Level I.

In Malaysia,\nthe term vape is used instead of EC when the liquid used is without nicotine. Since\nECs appeared on the market in 2006 smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of\nsmoking and for quitting, but some healthcare organizations, tobacco control\nadvocacy groups and policy makers have been reluctant to encourage smokers to\nswitch to ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Furthermore, there are\nconcerns of health hazards from the usage of electronic cigarette / vape; from\nnicotine poisoning, hazards of flavourings, risk of exposure to carcinogens, as well\nas threat to de-normalisation of smoking (WHO 2014). Results from two earlier studies found that participants using an EC were more likely\nto have abstained from smoking for at least 6 months compared with participants\nusing placebo EC (RR=2.29; 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo 4% versus EC 9%). The\none study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant difference in sixmonth abstinence rates (RR=1.26; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.34). However, it was noted that\nthese 2 studies were rated low and very low, respectively, based on GRADE\nstandards53, Level I.

Web based programmes are a promising\ndelivery system for assisting smokers to quit, but further research is needed to\nidentify their most effective use. 4.4.6 Aversive smoking for smoking cessation\nThe existing studies provide insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of rapid\nsmoking, or whether there is a dose-response to aversive stimulation. Milder\nversions of aversive smoking seem to lack specific efficacy. Rapid smoking is an\nunproven method with sufficient indications of promise to warrant evaluation using\nmodern rigorous methodology61, Level I. 5.0\nFOR PATIENTS WHO ARE UNWILLING TO QUIT\nMotivational interviewing (MI) techniques may assist with smoking cessation when\nthe health care providers are empathetic, promotes patient autonomy (e.g., choice\namong options), avoids arguments, and supports the patient\u2019s self-efficacy (e.g., by\nidentifying previous successes in behaviour change efforts)62, Level III; 63 , Level I.

The clinician\nshould emphasize that smoking low-tar/low-nicotine cigarettes or use\nof other forms of tobacco (e.g., smokeless tobacco, cigars, and pipes)\nwill not eliminate these risks.

A\n6.0\nPATIENTS WHO HAVE RECENTLY QUIT (RELAPSE PREVENTION)\nFor smokers who have recently quit, relapse prevention intervention may focus on\nidentifying and resolving tempting situations or smoking cues64, Level I. Most\ninterventions have tried a skills-based approach, where recent quitters are taught\nto recognise high-risk situations and acquire the skills to withstand the temptation\nto smoke. However, trained health care providers should provide targeted and\neffective relapse prevention interventions due to the chronic relapsing nature of\ntobacco dependence 65, Level III; 66, Level III; 67,Level III). When clinicians encounter a patient who has quit tobacco use recently, they should:\na. Reinforce the patient\u2019s decision to quit\nb. Review with patient the benefits of quitting\nc. Assist the patient in resolving any residual problems arising from quitting. Almost all lapses occur during the first 3 months after treatment and half of those\nwho have their first lapse smoke their second cigarette within 24 hours of the first\ncigarette or immediately following treatment68, Level I. The annual incidence of relapse\nwas around 20% to 25%69, Level I. Relapse prevention interventions can be delivered by means of scheduled clinic\nvisits, telephone calls, use of quitline or any time the clinician encounters an extobacco user. There are two practices of relapse prevention, either minimal or\nintensive. 6.1\nMinimal Practice Relapse Prevention\nThis is appropriate for most recent quitters and can be addressed briefly during a\ncoincident clinic visit or a scheduled follow-up visit. Similarly, the \u201c5 R\u2019s\u201d strategy\nshould be used to prevent relapse. Patients should be encouraged to report\ndifficulties promptly (e.g. lapses, depression, medication side-effects) while\ncontinuing efforts to remain abstinent. The simple D.E.A.D. pointer technique can\nbe applied to refrain oneself from smoking:\nDelay \u2013 Deliberately delay the act of lighting up cigarette by doing something else\nEscape \u2013 Escape any situation / environment that induce smoking\nAvoid \u2013 Plan to avoid situation / environment that induce smoking\nDistract \u2013 Distract the intention to smoke by doing relaxation techniques,\nhousework, spending time with family, etc. Strategy: Intervening with the patient who has recently quit\nFormer tobacco user should be congratulated on ANY success and strong\nencouragement to remain abstinent. When encountering a recent quitter, use open-ended questions relevant to\nthe topics below to discover if the patient wishes to discuss issues related\nto quitting (e.g., How has stopping tobacco use helped you?):\n\u2022 The benefits, including potential health benefits, the patient may derive from\ncessation\n\u2022 Any success the patient has had in quitting (duration of abstinence, reduction\nin withdrawal, etc.)\n\u2022 The problems encountered or anticipated threats to maintaining abstinence\n(e.g.", "chunk_order": 29}

These\ninterventions may be delivered during a dedicated follow-up contact (in-person or\nby telephone) or through a specialized clinic or programme. Specific interventions\nrecommended for problems related to maintaining smoking cessation are listed in\nthe strategy table below. Long-term smoking cessation pharmacotherapy should be\nconsidered as a strategy to reduce the likelihood of relapse. Strategy: Addressing problems encountered by former smokers\nA patient who previously smoked might identify a problem that negatively affects\nhealth or quality of life. Specific problems likely to be reported by former smokers\nand potential responses follow:\nProblems\nResponses\nLack of support\nfor cessation\n\u2022 Schedule follow-up visits or telephone calls with the\npatient. \u2022 Help the patient identify sources of support within his or\nher environment. \u2022 Refer the patient to an appropriate organization that offers\ncounselling or support. Negative mood\nor depression\n\u2022 If significant, provide counselling, prescribe appropriate\nmedication, or refer the patient to a specialist. Strong or\nprolonged\nwithdrawal\nsymptoms\n\u2022 If the patient reports prolonged craving or other\nwithdrawal symptoms, consider extending the use of an\napproved medication or adding/combining medications to\nreduce strong withdrawal symptoms. Weight gain\n\u2022 Recommend starting or increasing physical activity. \u2022 Reassure the patient that some weight gain after quitting\nis common and usually is self-limiting. \u2022 Emphasize the health benefits of quitting relative to the\nhealth risks of modest weight gain. \u2022 Emphasize the importance of a healthy diet and active\nlifestyle. \u2022 Suggest low-calorie substitutes such as sugarless\nchewing gum, vegetables, or mints. \u2022 Refer the patient to a nutritional counsellor or programme. Smoking lapses\n\u2022 Suggest continued use of medications, which can reduce\nthe likelihood that a lapse will lead to a full relapse. \u2022 Encourage another quit attempt or a commitment to total\nabstinence. \u2022 Reassure that quitting may take multiple attempts, and\nuse the lapse as a learning experience. \u2022 Provide or refer for intensive counselling.

A\n7.0\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS\n7.1\nFemale Smokers\nSmoking cessation clinical trials reveal that the same treatments benefit both men\nand women71, Level II-2; 72, Level II-2. However, research suggests that some treatments\nare less efficacious in women than in men (e.g., NRTs) 73, Level I due to lack of\ndocumented data on smoking status among women and lack of intervention74, Level I\nas well as different brain system modulated by noradrenergic activity in women75,\nLevel II-2. Women found to be less likely to stop76, Level II-3, may have more difficulty to\nquit smoking77, Level I and less likely to be abstinent compared to men78, Level I. Although research shows that women benefit from the same interventions as men,\nwomen may face different stressors and barriers to quitting that should be\naddressed in treatment. These stressors and barriers include greater weight control\nconcerns79, Level II-2, hormonal cycles80, Level II-2 and stress smoking77, 2015 Level I). Women who are considering pregnancy may be especially receptive to tobacco\ncessation. Other documented evidence which improve female smokers to quit are social\nsupport81, Level I, physical activity82, Level II-2; 83, Level II-3 and customised intervention\nprogramme for women especially pregnant smokers who are coming for antenatal\nfollow up84, Level I. 7.2\nPregnant and Lactating Women\nSmoking in pregnancy imparts risks to both the mother and the foetus. Cigarette\nsmoking by pregnant women has been shown to cause adverse foetal outcomes,\nincluding stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, decreased foetal growth, premature\nbirths85, Level II-2, low birth-weight, placental abruption, decrease psychomotor\ndevelopment82, Level II-2 and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); and has been\nlinked to cognitive, emotional, and behavioural problems in children such as\nhyperactivity/inattention86, Level II; 87; Level II-2; 88, Level III. Many women are motivated to quit during pregnancy, and health care professionals\ncan take advantage of this motivation by reinforcing the knowledge that cessation\nwill reduce health risks to the foetus and that there are postpartum benefits for both\nthe mother and child.

A\n7.3\nHospitalised Smokers\nHospitalisation provides a powerful opportunity to quit smoking. It is vital that they\nattempt to quit smoking, as smoking may interfere with their recovery. Augmented\nsmoking cessation treatments e.g. self-help via brochure or audio/videotape, chart,\nprompt reminding physician to advise smoking cessation, pharmacotherapy,\nhospital counselling, and post-discharge counselling telephone calls have been\nshown to be effective. Among cardiac patients, second heart attacks are more\ncommon in those who continue to smoke95.

Additionally, smoking\ndelays bone and wound healing101; 102; 103. Hospitalised patients may be particularly motivated to make a quit attempt for two\nreasons. Firstly, the illness causing the hospitalisation may have been due to or\nexacerbated by smoking, highlighting the patient\u2019s personal vulnerability to the\nhealth risks of smoking104; 105. Secondly, all hospitals in Malaysia are designated\nsmoke-free areas106.

Studies have shown that the prevalence of smoking amongst psychiatric patients\ncan be as high as two to three times that of the general population108, Level II-3; 109, Level\nII-1. Often, these same smokers smoke at higher rates, on average 25 cigarettes per\nday110, Level II-1; are highly addicted and it is estimated that they consume 43.9% of\nall cigarettes sold in the US111, Level II-2. These same patients have higher health\nmorbidity and mortality, dying 25 years earlier compared to the persons who do not\nsmoke112, Level II-2. Despite these startling numbers, psychiatric patients often do not receive advice or\ntreatment to quit smoking19, Level II-3. In a study, a total of 105 psychiatric patients who\nwere identified as current smokers, only 1 patient was encouraged to quit smoking,\nreferred for cessation treatment, and provided with nicotine replacement therapy on\ndischarge113, Level II-2. Studies have shown that psychiatric patients can quit and want to quit 114; 115, Level II3 and those who do quit often receive similar health benefits as those without\npsychiatric illness. The American Psychiatry Association (APA) also recommends\nthat psychiatrists assess the smoking status of all patients, including readiness to\nquit, previous quitting history and level of nicotine dependence116, Level II-2. Therefore,\nit is important that ALL patients be asked to quit when seen in psychiatric services. Despite the very good and extensive database on the safety and efficacy of\npharmacological treatment of tobacco dependence, only a few studies have\nexamined their use in mentally ill patients. Depression and schizophrenia have been\nthe most studied amongst the various mental illnesses.

Record the smoking status:\nSmoking status should be evaluated and documented for every psychiatric patient\nand the degree of dependence should be documented (preferentially with the\nFTND). 2. Set the time of the intervention\nThe best time for cessation would be when the patient is in a stable phase, with no\nrecent or planned changes in medications and no urgent problems take precedence\n3. Give counselling\n\u20185 As Intervention\u2019 is recommended for the short-term intervention by physicians. To increase the quit rate, established programmes (individual therapy, group\ntherapy, telephone coaching) should be employed wherever available\n4. Offer drug treatment with a first-line product\nNRT, varenicline, bupropion should be given for even a mild degree of tobacco\ndependence. Attention must be paid on the severity of tobacco dependence,\npossible psychiatric side effects, drug-drug interactions and contraindications. 5. Contact within first days after quit day\n6. Perform follow-up visits\n7. Relapse prevention and management\nThe patient should be made aware that lapses and relapses are fine and a new\nattempt with different procedures (e.g. psychotherapy, medication) should be\ndiscussed with the patient. 7.4.1 Schizophrenia\nThere are limited smoking cessation pharmacological clinical trials conducted on\npersons suffering from schizophrenia. The most investigated smoking cessation\npharmacological treatments are nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), sustained\nrelease bupropion (bupropion SR) and varenicline. The effectiveness of NRT in this group of patients is unclear owing to the few trials\nwith small sample size. One trial compared the use of high dose transdermal\nnicotine patch (42 mg) with regular dose transdermal nicotine patch (21 mg) in 51\npatients with schizophrenia who wanted to quit smoking. In this trial, seven-day\npoint prevalence abstinence rates at eight weeks were not significantly different\nbetween the high dose group (32%) and the regular dose group (23%)118 , Level II-1. Bupropion has been found to be effective for smoking cessation in schizophrenia\npatients. A meta-analyses119, Level I reported that the cessation rates after using\nbupropion was significantly higher than placebo at the end of treatment (seven trials,\nN = 340; RR=3.03; 95% CI 1.69 to 5.42) and after six months (five trials, N = 214,\nRR=2.78; 95% CI 1.02 to 7.58). At the end of treatment, smokers with schizophrenia\nwho received bupropion smoked about 11 fewer cigarettes per day than those who\ntook placebo. There were no significant differences in positive, negative and\ndepressive symptoms between bupropion and placebo groups. There were no\nreports of major adverse events such as seizures with bupropion.", "chunk_order": 34}

There were no significant differences in positive, negative and\ndepressive symptoms between bupropion and placebo groups. There were no\nreports of major adverse events such as seizures with bupropion. The effectiveness of combination of different smoking cessation treatments is\nunclear in treating schizophrenia. Nevertheless, a 10-week, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial of bupropion (300 mg/day) in combination with transdermal nicotine\npatch (21 mg/24h) for 58 outpatient smokers with schizophrenia found that the\ncombination of bupropion and transdermal nicotine patch was well-tolerated and\nsignificantly improved short-term smoking abstinence in this group of patients120,\nLevel II-2. Another small randomized controlled trial by 121, Level II-1 found that patients\ntaking bupropion and NRT had a significant increase in smoking reduction at 3 and\n6 months (60% vs. 31%; P = 0.036), and a greater continuous abstinence rate at\nweek 8, (52% vs. 19%; P = 0.014) over patients taking placebo and NRT. For varenicline, the information that varenicline increased smoking cessation rates\nhigher than placebo in individuals with schizophrenia was based on two studies. These studies found that smokers with schizophrenia were nearly 5 times more\nlikely to quit compared to placebo at the end of the treatment (N = 137; RR=4.74,\n95% CI 1.34 to 16.71)119, Level I. This information, however, need to take into\nconsideration that it was based on only two studies. There is no sufficient direct\nevidence presently to know whether the benefit of varenicline is maintained for six\nmonths or more. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in reported\npsychiatric symptoms between the varenicline and placebo groups122, Level I. 7.4.2 Depression\nDepression is one of the commonest mental health conditions worldwide and is\nestimated to be the second leading cause of health morbidity by 2020123, Level II-3. Smoking and smoking cessation has been linked to both depressed mood and\ndepression, however, the relationship is unclear. A recent review by Gierisch (2012)124, Level I looking at smoking cessation\ninterventions for patients with depression identified only 3 RCT\u2019s out of the 16\nstudies reviewed which included patients with current depression. This review found\nsmall, but positive findings for the use of antidepressant (RR=1.31; 95% CI 0.73 to\n2.34), NRT and addition of behavioural mood management (RR=1.41; 95% CI 1.01\nto 1.96). The Cochrane group reviewed the use of antidepressants and smoking cessation\nand found positive results for both bupropion (44 trials and almost 13,000\nparticipants, RR=1.62, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.76) and nortryptyline (9 trials, 975\nparticipants, RR=2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.79)37, Level I.", "chunk_order": 35}

Both medications increase the\nlikelihood to quit, however, for bupropion this is seen for at least six weeks. This\nreview did not find any added advantage of the serotonin selective reuptake\ninhibitors (SSRIs) as a quit smoking agent (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.22). International guidelines have suggested that individuals with depression and\nwanting to quit smoking can be started on these two treatments. Varenicline has been found to be the most effective agent for smoking cessation\n(RR=2.31) and probably equally effective for both individuals with and without\ndepression. Risk of suicidal behaviour has not been found to be true in the\ncommunity37, Level I. However, caution is still recommended as a result of previous\nconcerns. Anxiolytics have not been found to be useful for smoking cessation. 7.4.3 Bipolar Disorder\nThere are only four published controlled smoking cessation treatment studies in\nsmokers with bipolar disorder using pharmacological agents such as nicotine\nreplacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline. An open-label, pilot study suggested that NRT (nicotine patch) may be an effective\ntreatment for tobacco dependence in bipolar smokers125, Level II-3. One small study on smoking cessation using sustained-release bupropion involved\nonly five patients. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study,\ntwo smokers in the bupropion group either quit or reduced their smoking compared\nto placebo treatment which was associated with early dropout from the study and\noccurrence of symptoms of hypomania126, Level I. In a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, relapseprevention clinical trial conducted in 10 community mental-health centres, 247\nsmokers with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were enrolled. Two hundred and\nthree received 12-week treatment with varenicline and cognitive behavioural\ntherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy alone. After a period of a year, the pointprevalence abstinence rates was 60% with varenicline treatment and 19% with\nplacebo (OR = 6.2; 95% CI 2.2 to 19.2). Varenicline was also found to be efficacious\nfor maintenance treatment in the study and furthermore there were no impact on\npsychiatric symptoms reported127, Level I. In another study by Chengappa et al. (2014)128, Level I, varenicline added to CBT,\ntripled 4-week continuous abstinence rates at the end of a standard 12-week course\nof treatment in smokers with bipolar disorder. There were significantly more subjects\nwith bipolar who quit smoking with varenicline (n/n = 15/31, 48.4%) compared to\nplacebo (n/n = 3/29, 10.3%) (OR=8.1; 95% CI 2.03 to 32.5) at 3 months. At 6\nmonths, 6 of 31 varenicline-treated subjects (19.4%) remained abstinent compared\nto 2 of 29 (6.90%) assigned to placebo (OR=3.2; 95%CI 0.60 to 17.6).", "chunk_order": 36}

Psychopathology scores remained stable throughout the study. Ten serious\nadverse events occurred (N = 6, varenicline; n = 4, placebo) with the most common\nreported as abnormal dreams occurred significantly more often in vareniclinetreated subjects (n/n = 18/31, 61.3%) than in those receiving placebo (n/n = 9/29,\n31%; P = .04). Eight people treated with varenicline and 5 placebo-assigned\nsubjects expressed fleeting suicidal ideation, a non-significant difference. With only two published RCT adequately powered to detect treatment efficacy in\nthis population, the data is currently inadequate to form a consensus guideline for\ntreating nicotine dependence in people with bipolar disorder. However, as currently\navailable treatments have been reported to be safe, all patients with bipolar should\nbe given pharmacological aid should they want to quit smoking. 7.4.4 Substance use disorder\n7.4.4.1 Alcohol use disorder\nIn an open trial of the transdermal nicotine replacement therapies for smoking\ncessation on 49 alcohol and drug-dependent patients (39/49 were alcohol\ndependent) who entered inpatient treatment, seven subjects (14.3%) self-reported\ntobacco abstinence at 21 days, and 5 (10.2%) self-reported abstinence as\noutpatients at 6 weeks129, Level II-2. There was evidence that bupropion \u2013 sustained release (bupropion-SR) is effective\nin helping alcohol dependent smokers to quit smoking. In an open-label, naturalistic\nstudy among alcohol dependent smokers, participant who received bupropion-SR\nwere more likely to abstain from smoking than controls at any of the follow-up time\npoints, reduced their smoking and smoked less cigarettes per day (CPD) at\nbaseline, 30 days and 180 days post-baseline, compared to controls130, Level I. A double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation study involving heavydrinkers found that varenicline produced a sustained decrease in alcohol\nconsumption in addition to a significant decrease in the number of cigarettes\nsmoked131, Level I. An open-label, pilot study suggested that varenicline may be an effective treatment\nfor tobacco dependence in recovering alcohol-dependent smokers132, Level II-1. The combination of two smoking cessation treatments had no added benefit in\nsmokers with a dependence to alcohol based on current evidence. In a double-blind\nplacebo-controlled study of sustained-release bupropion with NRT as a smoking\ncessation aid in 58 alcohol dependent smokers, it was found that the addition of\nbupropion to NRT (nicotine patch) did not improve smoking outcomes. One third of\nparticipants on bupropion reported discontinuing the drug during weeks 1 to 4. All\nstudy participants however, significantly reduced cigarette use133, Level I.", "chunk_order": 37}

One third of\nparticipants on bupropion reported discontinuing the drug during weeks 1 to 4. All\nstudy participants however, significantly reduced cigarette use133, Level I. 7.4.4.2 Cannabis use disorder\nThe co-occurrence of tobacco and cannabis use is high, however, treatments of\ntobacco use in this population is lacking134, Level I. A case series reported the use of\na 12-week, 9 session computer-assisted version of Motivational Enhancement\nTherapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Contingency\nManagement (CM), i.e., abstinence-based incentives aimed at both tobacco and\ncannabis use in those with cannabis use disorder. This programme included an\noptional tobacco intervention that comprised of five computer modules in a\ntailormade programme and NRT. All participants initiated the tobacco intervention\nbut 50% opted to use NRT. Five out of six participants made self-reported reduction\nattempts during treatment (i.e., reduced cigarette use lasting at least 24 h in\nduration), with a mean of 4.8 attempts (range 1\u20138), and cigarettes per day\ndecreased from intake to end of treatment 135, Level II-3. Studies on co-occurring drug use and tobacco use, however, did not report\nworsening of symptoms when using NRTs, bupropion or varenicline and therefore\nall available treatments can be used20, Level I. 7.4.4.3 Opioid use disorder in methadone maintenance treatment\nIn general, smoking cessation rates in methadone-maintained smokers is low. To\ndate, only two RCT have been conducted on this group of patient. This study used\na three-group randomized design, whereby it attempted to study the efficacy of\nvarenicline versus placebo, in comparison with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT),\nin 315 persons methadone-maintained smokers (varenicline =137, placebo=45 and\ncombination nicotine replacement =133). This study found that the 7-day abstinence\nat 6-months was 5.4% overall, with varenicline 3.7% compared to placebo 2.2%,\nand NRT 8.3% (p> .05). Between baseline and 6-months there was an overall selfreported mean reduction of 8.3 cigarettes/day. This study reported that quitting\nusing NRTs to be comparable to other studies and the use of varenicline did not\nincrease quit rates in this population136, Level I. In another study, 383 methadone-maintained smokers were assigned randomly to\nnicotine patch (8\u2013 12 weeks) plus either (1) a baseline tailored brief motivational\nintervention, a quit date behavioural skills counselling session and a relapse\nprevention follow-up session or (2) brief advice using the National Cancer Institute\u2019s\n4 As model. In this study, a tailored behavioural intervention did not increase quit\nrates over NRT and National Cancer Institute\u2019s 4 As model treatment137, Level I.", "chunk_order": 38}

Recommendation 6\nGrade\nFor psychiatric and substance abuse disorder patients:\n\u2022 Record the smoking status of ALL patients (preferable with the\nFagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence or carbon monoxide\nsmokerlyzer)\n\u2022 Set the time of intervention (quit date) when the patient\u2019s mental\nstatus is stable\n\u2022 Provide \u201c5 A\u2019s intervention\u201d by trained health care providers\n\u2022 Offer pharmacotherapy to ALL smokers with psychiatric condition\no Caution should be taken when using varenicline and\nbupropion\u2013NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline\n\u2022 Behavioural support should be provided where applicable and\navailable\nA\nC\nC\nA - B\nA\n7.5 Children and Adolescents\nHealthcare providers should screen paediatric and adolescent patients, and their\nparents, for tobacco use and exposure. Counselling and behavioural interventions that\nhave been shown to be effective are recommended for children and adolescents 20,\nLevel I; 138, Level II-1. The contents of these interventions should be modified according to\nthe age of the child139, Level III. When treating adolescent smokers, clinicians may\nconsider NRT or bupropion SR when there is evidence of nicotine dependence and\ndesire to quit140, Level I. However, because of the psychosocial behavioural aspects of\nsmoking in adolescents, clinicians should be very sure of the patient\u2019s tobacco\ndependence and intention to quit before instituting pharmacotherapy. Special\nconsideration should be given to the degree of dependence, number of cigarettes per\nday, and body weight. Healthcare providers in a paediatric setting should offer smoking cessation advice and\ninterventions to parents or guardians to limit children\u2019s exposure to second-hand\nsmoke20, Level I. Youth smokers of today are likely to become regular smokers of tomorrow. It is\nestimated that 90% of smokers start smoking before the age of 18. In Malaysia, 71%\nof adolescent smokers tried their first cigarette before the age of 14 year old141, Level III. Hence it is important to reduce the amount of tobacco use (including nicotine use in\nelectronic cigarettes) among youth so as to decrease the rate of nicotine dependence\nand subsequent morbidity and mortality in future adults142, Level II-3. Early intervention\nof their nicotine dependence will increase the likelihood of them not becoming adult\nsmokers. Adolescents are likely to model parents\u2019 behaviour and adopt similar norms. Youth\nwho have family members and close friends who smoke have a stronger predilection\nto regular smoking. The role of socio-economic and demographic factors in smoking\ninitiation/experimentation is well documented. These factors include low socioeconomic status, smoking among family and friends, low self-esteem, poor academic\nperformances and behavioural problems 143, Level II-1; 144, Level II-2.", "chunk_order": 39}

These factors include low socioeconomic status, smoking among family and friends, low self-esteem, poor academic\nperformances and behavioural problems 143, Level II-1; 144, Level II-2. Complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days\npoint prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those\nincorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational\nenhancement and CBT. Given the episodic nature of adolescent smoking, more data\nis needed on sustained quitting. There were few trials with evidence about\npharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none\ndemonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. There is not yet sufficient\nevidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. There\ncontinues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled\ntrials of interventions for this population of smokers. 7.6\nElderly\nSmoking cessation in older smokers can reduce the excess risk of cardiovascular\nrelated events and mortality even at older age145, Level II-2. Treatment for smoking cessation can led to similar abstinence rates in older and\nyounger smokers146, Level II-2. Nonetheless, using age as a predictor for tailoring\nsmoking cessation drugs might potentially lead to a more individualized prescription\nof smoking cessation therapy. For example, a study has shown that being over 60\nyears of age was significantly associated with increased cessation success among\nthose who used NRT alone, while the effectiveness of varenicline and bupropion were\nnot significantly different according to age groups. Counselling interventions, physician advice, buddy support programmes, age-tailored\nself-help materials, telephone counselling, and the nicotine patch all have been shown\nto be effective in treating tobacco use in adults 50 and older20, Level I. Elderly smokers\nwith co-morbidities and psychological distress are more likely to try to stop smoking147,\nLevel II-2, while older adults with low psychological distress and fewer health concerns\nare less likely to quit. This second group may need different sorts of motivational and\neducational strategies to support smoking cessation148, Level II-2. 8.0\nMANAGEMENT OF WEIGHT GAIN\nFor smokers who are greatly concerned about weight gain, it may be most appropriate\nto prescribe or recommend bupropion SR or NRT, in particular nicotine gum, which\nhave been shown to delay weight gain after quitting20, Level I. Quitting smoking is often followed by weight gain hence, health professionals involved\nshould:\ni. Note that the health risks of weight gain are small when compared to the risks\nof continued smoking\nii. Recommend physical activities and a balanced, healthy diet to control weight\niii. Recommend that patients should concentrate primarily on smoking cessation,\nnot weight control, until ex-smokers are confident that they will not return to\nsmoking.

A majority of smokers gain weight after they quit smoking. Smoking cessation is\nassociated with a mean increase of 4-5 kg in body weight after 12 months of\nabstinence, and most weight gain occurs within three months of quitting149, Level I. It has\nbeen reported that about 10% of quitters gain up to 15 kilograms150, Level I. However,\nweight gain that follows smoking cessation is a negligible health threat compared with\nthe risks of continued smoking151, Level I. Weight gain that follows smoking cessation is a negligible health threat compared with\nthe risks of continue smoking. Post-cessation weight gain appears to be caused both\nby increased intake and by metabolic adjustments. The involvement of metabolic\nmechanisms suggests that even if smokers do not increase their caloric intake upon\nquitting, they will, on average, gain some weight152, Level II-1; 153, Level II-2; 154, Level II-1. Some smoking cessation pharmacological treatments may also have limited weight\ngain. Bupropion, fluoxetine, NRT and varenicline all limit weight gain during treatment\nhowever, the effects on weight gain reduction were smaller after the treatment had\nstopped and there was insufficient evidence to be sure that these effects persisted in\nthe long-term155, Level I; 156; Level I. 9.0\nIMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nIt is essential to manage the treatment of tobacco use disorder at all healthcare levels\nin Malaysia by using an evidence-based CPG. This aims to increase the success rate\nfor tobacco users to beat their nicotine addiction. 9.1\nFacilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG include:-\ni. wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies)\nii. training and regular update for healthcare providers\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG are:-\ni. inadequate understanding of evidence-based treatment of tobacco use\nii. insufficient resources especially trained personnel, pharmacotherapy and\ninfrastructure\niii. variation in treatment practice and preferences\n9.2\nPotential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:-\ni. ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare providers\nii. initiate training (with adequate funding) of healthcare providers ensuring\ninformation is up-to-date\niii. ensure availability of dedicated management team and trained including\nmultidisciplinary team at different levels of healthcare where appropriate\niv. ensure widespread distribution of updated patient education materials\nImplementation strategies such as Quick Reference and Training Module will be\ndeveloped following the approval of the CPG by MoH.

Bupropion SR (bupropion sustained-release). A non-nicotine aid to smoking\ncessation originally developed and marketed as an antidepressant. It is chemically\nunrelated to tricyclics, tetracyclics, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or other\nknown antidepressant medications. Its mechanism of action is presumed to be\nmediated through its capacity to block the re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine\ncentrally. Clinician. A professional directly providing health care services. Extra-treatment social support component. Interventions or elements of an\nintervention wherein patients are provided with tools or assistance in obtaining social\nsupport outside of treatment. This category is distinct from intra-treatment social\nsupport, in which social support is delivered directly by treatment staff. First-line\npharmacotherapy\nfor\ntobacco\ndependence. First-line\npharmacotherapies have been found to be safe and effective for tobacco dependence\ntreatment and have been approved by the FDA for this use. First-line medications\nhave established empirical record of efficacy, and should be considered first as part\nof tobacco dependence treatment except in cases of contraindications. Intensive Clinical Intervention. Refers to interventions that involve extended\ncontact between clinicians and patients. It was coded based on the length of contact\nbetween clinicians and patients (greater than 10 minutes). If that information was\nunavailable, it was coded based on the content of the contact between clinicians and\npatients. Intra-treatment social support. Refers to an intervention component that is intended\nto provide encouragement, a sense of concern, and interested empathic listening as\npart of the treatment. Low-intensity counselling. Low-intensity counselling refers to interventions that\ninvolve contact between clinicians and patients and that last between 3 and 10\nminutes. If the information on length of contact was unavailable, it was coded based\non the description of content of the clinical intervention. Brief Clinical Intervention. Brief clinical intervention refers to interventions that\ninvolve very brief contact between clinicians and patients.", "chunk_order": 52}

It was coded based on the\nlength of contact between clinicians and patients (3 minutes or less). If that information\nwas unavailable, it was coded based on the content of the clinical intervention. Motivation. A type of intervention designed to bolster patients\u2019 resolve to quit through\nmanipulations such as setting a quit date, use of a contract with a specified quit date,\nreinforcing correspondence (letters mailed from clinical/study staff congratulating the\npatient on his or her decision to quit or on early success), providing information about\nthe health risks of smoking, and so on. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Refers to a medication containing nicotine that\nis intended to promote smoking cessation. There are a few nicotine replacement\ntherapy delivery systems currently approved for use in Malaysia. These include\nnicotine chewing gum, nicotine inhaler and nicotine patch, nicotine nasal spray. Person-to-person intervention. In-person, or face -to-face, contact between a\nclinician and a patient(s) for the purpose of tobacco use intervention or assessment. Practical counselling (problem solving/skills training). Refers to a tobacco use\ntreatment in which tobacco users are trained to identify and cope with events or\nproblems that increase the likelihood of their tobacco use. For example, quitters might\nbe trained to anticipate stressful events and to use coping skills such as distraction or\ndeep breathing to cope with an urge to smoke. Related and similar interventions are\ncoping skill training, relapse prevention, and stress management. Primary care clinician. A clinician (e.g., in medicine, nursing, psychology,\npharmacology, dentistry/oral health, physical, occupational, and respiratory therapy)\nwho provides basic health care services for problems other than tobacco use per se. Primary care providers are encouraged to identify tobacco users and to intervene,\nregardless of whether tobacco use is the patient\u2019s presenting problem. Proactive telephone counselling. Treatment initiated by a clinician who telephones\nand counsels the patient over the telephone. Psychosocial interventions. Refers to intervention strategies that are designed to\nincrease tobacco abstinence rates due to psychological or social support\nmechanisms. These interventions comprise such treatment strategies as counselling,\nself-help, and behavioural treatment like rapid smoking and contingency contracting. Quit date. The date of a given cessation attempt during which a patient tries to abstain\ntotally from tobacco use. Also, refers to a motivational intervention, whereby a patient\ncommits to quit tobacco use on a specified day. Randomised controlled trial.", "chunk_order": 53}

Second-hand smoke is a combination of side-stream cigarette smoke and the\nexhaled main-stream smoke. Those who are exposed to second hand smoke for 15\nminutes in two days within a week is defined as second-hand smokers. Second-line pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence. Second-line medications\nare pharmacotherapies for which there is evidence of efficacy for treating\ntobacco dependence, but they have a more limited role than first-line medications\nbecause: (1) the FDA has not approved them for a tobacco dependence treatment\nindication, and (2) there are more concerns about potential side effects than exist\nwith first-line medications. Second-line treatments should be considered for use on\na case-by-case basis after first-line treatments have been used or considered. Self-help. An intervention strategy in which the patient uses a non-pharmacologic\nphysical aid to achieve abstinence from tobacco. Self -help strategies typically involve\nlittle contact with a clinician, although some strategies (e.g., hotline/helpline) involve\npatient-initiated contact. Examples of types of self-help materials include: pamphlets /\nbooklets / mailings / manuals; videos; audios; referrals to 12-step programmes; mass\nmedia community-level interventions; lists of community programmes; reactive\ntelephone hotlines/helplines; and computer programmes/Internet.

Refers to assessment of patient characteristics, such\nas nicotine dependence and motivation for quitting, that may allow clinicians to\ntailor interventions to the needs of the individual patient. Weight/diet/nutrition component. An intervention strategy designed to address\nweight gain or concerns about weight gain. Interventions that teach diet/weight\nmanagement strategies, incorporate wee kly weight monitoring (for reasons other\nthan\nroutine\ndata\ncollection),\nrequire\nor\nsuggest\nenergy\nintake\nmaintenance/reduction, and/or convey nutritional information/counselling.

Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide\nattempt, has been reported in patients undergoing a smoking\ncessation attempt. These symptoms have also been\nreported while attempting to quit smoking with varenicline. Clinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of\nsignificant\ndepressive\nsymptomatology\nin\npatients\nundergoing a smoking cessation attempt, and should advise\npatients accordingly. Effects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery:\nVarenicline may have minor or moderate influence on the\nability to drive and use machines. Varenicline may cause\ndizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the\nability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not\nto drive, operate complex machinery or engage in other\npotentially hazardous activities until it is known whether\nvarenicline affects their ability to perform these activities. Use in lactation: It is unknown whether varenicline is\nexcreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that\nvarenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether\nto continue / discontinue breastfeeding or to continue /\ndiscontinue therapy with varenicline should be made taking\ninto account the benefit of breastfeeding to the child and the\nbenefit of varenicline therapy to the woman. Side effects\nIn general, when adverse reactions occurred, onset was in\nthe 1st week of therapy; severity was generally mild to\nmoderate and there were no differences by age, race or\ngender with regard to the incidence of adverse reactions. In patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice\ndaily following an initial titration period, the adverse event\nmost commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the\nmajority of cases, nausea occurred early in the treatment\nperiod which was mild to moderate in severity and seldom\nresulted in discontinuation. The treatment discontinuation\nrate due to adverse events was 11.4% for varenicline\ncompared with 9.7% for placebo. In this group, the\ndiscontinuation rates for the most common adverse events\nin varenicline-treated patients were as follows: Nausea\n(2.7% vs 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs 1% for\nplacebo), insomnia (1.3% vs 1.2% for placebo) and\nabnormal dreams (0.2% vs 0.2% for placebo).

However, since elderly patients are more likely to\nhave decreased renal function, prescribers should consider\nthe renal status of an elderly patient. Children: varenicline is not recommended for use in children\nor adolescents <18 years due to insufficient data on safety\nand efficacy. Prescribing\ninstruction\nThe patient should set a date to stop smoking. Dosing should\nstart 1-2 weeks before this date. Tablets should be\nswallowed whole with water, can be taken with or without\nfood, but incidence of nausea increases when taken on an\nempty stomach. Patients should be treated for 12 weeks.

No data are available on the efficacy of an additional 12\nweeks course of treatment for patients who do not succeed\nin stopping smoking during initial therapy or who relapse\nafter treatment. In smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is\nelevated in the period immediately following the end of\ntreatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose\ntapering may be considered.

Appendix 7\nFDA Pregnancy Class\nCategory Description\nA\nMedicines are considered safe to be used throughout pregnancy. Medicines have been taken by a large number of pregnant women and\nwomen of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency\nof malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the foetus. B\nMedicines which have been taken by only a limited number of pregnant\nwomen and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the\nfrequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects\non the human foetus. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an\nincreased occurrence of foetal damage, or are inadequate or may be\nlacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence\nof foetal damage, or there are evidence of an increased occurrence of\nfoetal damage, but the significance of which is considered uncertain in\nhumans. C\nMedicines which have caused or may be suspected of causing harmful\neffects on the human foetus or newborn infant without causing\nmalformations. These effects may be reversible. Medicines must only\nbe given only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the\nfoetus. D\nMedicines that have caused, are suspected to have caused or may be\nexpected to cause an increased incidence of human foetal\nmalformations or irreversible damage. The use is warranted only in\nlife-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer\nmedicines cannot be used or ineffective. X\nMedicines which have such a high risk of causing permanent damage to\nthe foetus that they should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a\npossibility of pregnancy.
