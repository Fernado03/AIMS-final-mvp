They are intended as a guide for the best clinical practice\nin the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molar teeth presently. However, it must be\nnoted that adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in\nindividual patient care, as every health care provider is responsible for the management of his/her\nunique patient based on the clinical presentation and management options available locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in November 2021 and will be reviewed in 2026 or earlier if important\nnew evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, the head of the related specialty will\nbe informed about it. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will be done on the need\nfor a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. The systematic review methodology used by\nthe Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed in reviewing the\nguidelines. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this\ndocument, which is the definitive version at all times.

Key Message 2\n\u2022\nIn view of limited evidence, CBCT imaging is indicated in cases where conventional\n(panoramic and/or intraoral) imaging cannot provide satisfactory diagnostic\ninformation. Key Message 3\n\u2022\nThe clinical status of second molar is important to determine the need or indication\nfor the removal of third molar. LIST OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nRecommendation 1\n\u2022\nRemoval of third molars may be considered to reduce the risk of dental caries in the\nadjacent second molars. Recommendation 2\n\u2022\nRemoval of third molars may be considered in reducing periodontal problem in\nadjacent second molars. Recommendation 3\n\u2022\nTriangular or envelop flap may be used in the surgical removal of impacted\nmandibular third molars. Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth\nRecommendation 4\n\u2022\nCoronectomy may be considered in the management of unerupted and/or impacted\nmandibular third molar which has close proximity with the IAN to reduce the risk of\nIAN injury. Recommendation 5\n\u2022\nAnalgesics should be prescribed for removal of third molars. o Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the preferred option. Recommendation 6\n\u2022\nAntibiotics may be considered in third molar surgery when there is significant bone\nremoval and/or prolonged operation time. o Amoxicillin is the preferred option. Recommendation 7\n\u2022\nCorticosteroids should be used in third molar surgery to reduce post-surgery\noedema and trismus when there is no contraindication. Recommendation 8\n\u2022\nChlorhexidine mouthwash should be used in third molar surgery to prevent dry\nsocket. Recommendation 9\n\u2022\nThird molars and post-coronectomy cases should be monitored periodically. Patients\nshould be made aware of the risks that can arise even when it is asymptomatic and\nbe involved in the decision making. Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThese clinical practice guidelines (CPG) were developed by a multidisciplinary expert\ncommittee consisting of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, a Paediatric Dental Specialist, a\nPeriodontist, an Orthodontist and a Dental Officer mainly from the Ministry of Health and the\nMinistry of Higher Education. The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar\nTeeth (December 2005) was used as the basis for the development of these guidelines. The\nrecommendations were formulated taking into consideration the best available evidence and\nlocal practices. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. The scope has\nbeen expanded to include new and updated information. In addition, clinical audit indicators\nhave also been identified for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes.", "chunk_order": 2}

The scope has\nbeen expanded to include new and updated information. In addition, clinical audit indicators\nhave also been identified for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases: Medline,\nPubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and Embase while full text\njournal articles were retrieved from these databases. The literature search was limited to\nhuman study, English language and published articles from 2006 to September 2021. In\naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further\nidentify relevant studies. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cutoff date. An example of the search strategy used can be found in Appendix 1. Details of the\nsearch strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. There were five (5) clinical questions which were assigned to members of the development\ngroup. The group members met a total of 22 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All retrieved articles were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme\n(CASP) checklist by at least two members, presented in the form of evidence tables and\ndiscussed during group meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were\nagreed upon by both the development group and reviewers. This CPG is based on the\nfindings of systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, observational studies and case\nreports, with local practices taken into consideration. However, when there was lack of\nevidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group members. Although ideally\npatients\u2019 views and preferences need to be considered in the development of CPGs, in this\ninstance, it was not feasible. Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US / Canadian Preventive\nServices Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the formulation of recommendation was\ndone using the principles of GRADE. The writing of the CPG strictly follows the requirements\nof Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE II). The draft was reviewed by a panel of internal and external reviewers. Recommendations\nwere presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, and finally to the HTA and\nCPG Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for approval.

INTRODUCTION\nThird molars, also known as wisdom teeth, are generally the last teeth to erupt after the age\nof seventeen. The position of the teeth is posterior to the second molars, where space can be\nlimited for the eruption to take place. Impaction of third molars can be due to several factors,\nincluding lack of space, obstruction by adjacent structures or tooth and abnormal position\nduring tooth development. 1 Impacted third molars can be entirely or partially covered by\nbone and/or soft tissue. Wisdom teeth that are partially erupted in dental arches are usually\nvisible clinically, but have not achieved the normal functional position. The average rate of third molar impaction worldwide was 24.4% in adults 17 years and above. The prevalence of mandibular impaction (25.4%) was significantly higher than maxillary\nimpaction (14.2%). Adults with impacted wisdom teeth would commonly have one or two\nimpacted wisdom teeth rather than three or four impacted teeth. There was no significant\npredilection between genders on the occurrence of impacted third molars. In terms of angle\nof impaction, clinicians would more likely encounter mesio-angular impaction (41.2%),\nfollowed by vertical (25.6%), disto-angular (12.2%) and horizontal impaction (11.1%). 2\nThe introduction of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has led clinicians to consider\nits usage for three-dimensional assessment of third molars and its relationship with adjacent\nstructures, particularly inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). However, there is a need to address its\nclinical usefulness in these cases. Surgical removal of third molar is associated with the risk of IAN injury. In the last two\ndecades, a new surgical technique, coronectomy, has been introduced to reduce the risk\nof IAN injury. There has been much debate among clinicians with regards to this technique. In view of new developments in the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molar,\nthis CPG is updated to include the aforementioned issues. Thus, evidence-based decision\nmaking in managing unerupted and impacted third molars is necessary to allow clinicians\nto identify and assess updated multifactorial aspects relevant to the management of this\nspecific dental condition. Management of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth\n2. DIAGNOSIS\n2.1\nHistory Taking & Clinical Examination\nUnerupted and/or impacted third molar is diagnosed clinically by detailed history taking and\ngood clinical examination. Common signs and symptoms for this condition include:\n\u2022\npain\n\u2022\nswelling\n\u2022\ntrismus\n\u2022\nfever\nImaging may be required to confirm the diagnosis and to observe the morphology of the tooth\nand surrounding structures and associated pathological conditions (e.g. caries, periodontal\ndisease and cyst). 2.2\nImaging\n2.2.1 Plain Radiography\nThe most commonly used plain radiographs in the management of unerupted and/or impacted\nthird molar are orthopantomogram (OPG) and intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Three\nmeta-analyses studied the predictors of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) exposure in OPG among\npatients with impacted mandibular third molars. The number of primary studies ranged from\nfive to nine and of moderate quality.", "chunk_order": 6}

It is widely used in diagnosis and treatment\nplanning of unerupted and/or impacted third molar. A systematic review studied the diagnostic accuracy of CBCT compared with OPG in\npredicting exposure of IAN in impacted third molar. Two diagnostic studies showed conflicting\nresults in the comparison.

Thus, the\nsystematic review did not provide strong evidence to support or refute the prophylactic removal\nof disease-free impacted third molars to prevent crowding. 3.4\nCyst / Pathology\nImpacted third molars should be removed when it is associated with cyst / tumour. 11, level III\n3.5\nIn the line of Mandibular Fracture\nAngle of the mandible is a common site for mandibular fracture.

In a meta-analysis of low\nto moderate quality RCTs with moderate risk of bias, the use of PRF in post-operative\nmandibular third molar removal: 26, level I\n\u2022\nreduced post-operative pain on day-3 (SMD=\u2009-0.53, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.05)\n\u2022\nreduced swelling on day-1 (WMD=\u2009-0.55, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.01)\n\u2022\nreduced risk of alveolar osteitis (RR=0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.75)\n\u2022\nhad no significant improvement on trismus, osteoblastic activity and soft tissue healing. However, there is limited evidence on the use of PRF in reduction of pain, swelling and\nalveolar osteitis. Therefore, there is no strong clinical benefit on the use of PRF in postoperative third molar surgeries. 4.5\nFollow-Up\nThere was insufficient evidence to recommend a specific follow-up. The Faculty of Dentistry\nEngland 2020 recommended that active surveillance or clinical review may be considered\nfor third molars which are not indicated for removal. 15, level III\nThe American Association of Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon (AAOMS) recommended that the\nfrequency of follow-up visits be approximately every 24 months and the examination be\ncompleted by a specialist or general dentist. Active surveillance as a management strategy\nis based on expert opinion. 15, level III\nIn local setting, monitoring of unerupted and/or impacted third molars and post-coronectomy\nshould be done as part of routine dental check-up annually in view of future diseases that\nmay be associated with retained third molars.

Patients\nshould be made aware of the risks that can arise even when it is asymptomatic and\nbe involved in the decision making.", "chunk_order": 14}

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nIt is important to standardise the management of unerupted and/or impacted third molars in\nan appropriate manner at all healthcare levels in Malaysia using an evidence-based CPG\nin order to manage it appropriately. Clinicians are required to keep abreast with knowledge\nthrough continuing professional education as well as understanding of patients\u2019 expectations. Therefore, it is important for these guidelines to be disseminated to all healthcare\nprofessionals in primary and secondary healthcare facilities. This can be facilitated through\nthe development of appropriate training modules and quick references. Several factors may\naffect the implementation of the recommendations of the CPG. 5.1\nFacilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG include:\na) wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare professionals and teaching institutions via\nprinted and electronic copies\nb) continuing professional education on the management of unerupted and/or impacted\nthird molar teeth for healthcare professionals\nc) adequate facilities at primary and secondary care level for diagnosing and treating\nunerupted and/or impacted third molar teeth\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG include:\na) lack of understanding or limited knowledge on the management of unerupted and/or\nimpacted third molar teeth\nb) variation in skills and treatment practices\nc) constraints in equipment and facilities\n5.2\nPotential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:\na) ensure widespread distribution of the CPG in hard and soft copy to healthcare\nprofessionals in primary and secondary healthcare facilities\nb) strengthen training of healthcare professionals to ensure knowledge and information is\nup to date\nManagement of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth\n5.3\nProposed Clinical Audit Indicators\nTo assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed as clinical audit\nindicators for quality management of unerupted and/or impacted third molars:\nPercentage of nerve\ninjury following surgical\nremoval of impacted\nlower third molar\n=\nNumber of patients developed\nnerve injury after surgical removal of\nimpacted lower third molar yearly\nX\n100%\nNumber of impacted lower third molar\nsurgery cases done yearly\nPercentage of patients\ngiven chlorhexidine\nmouthwash\nperioperatively for\nsurgical removal of\nimpacted lower third\nmolar developed dry\nsocket. =\nNumber of patients given chlorhexidine\nmouthwash perioperatively for surgical\nremoval of impacted lower third molar\ndeveloped dry socket yearly\nX\n100%\nNumber of patients given chlorhexidine\nmouthwash perioperatively for surgical\nremoval of impacted lower third molar\ndone yearly\nManagement of Unerupted and Impacted Third Molar Teeth\nREFERENCES\n1.", "chunk_order": 15}
