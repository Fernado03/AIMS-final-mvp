Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Chronic Hepatitis B in Adults\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2022 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2026) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When\nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken\nto ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of\npublication.

Management of Chronic Hepatitis B in Adults\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the DG for these CPG were from the Ministry of\nHealth (MoH) and the Ministry of Higher Education. There was active\ninvolvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee during the process\nof the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Embase. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion\ncriteria are all adults at risk and with hepatitis B infection regardless of\nstudy design. The first search was limited to literature published in the\nlast 10 years (2010 - 2020) for majority of the clinical questions and on\nadults aged 19 to 44 years old and in English. In addition, the reference\nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts\nin the field were contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were\nconducted from 24 July 2020 to 30 September 2020. The literature\nsearch was repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG\ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before 31\nJuly 2022 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence\npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can\nbe obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.", "chunk_order": 3}

Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG\nmembers met 24 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and review committee (RC). Where evidence was insufficient,\nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. Management of Chronic Hepatitis B in Adults\nThe literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE II). On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback\nfrom any interested parties.

In Malaysia, the incidence rate is approximately\n12.64 in 100,000 population.3, level III The prevalence is decreasing due to\nimprovements in socioeconomic status, universal vaccination programs\nand perhaps effective antiviral treatments. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted by perinatal or horizontal\ntransmission, percutaneous, and sexual exposure and exposure to\ninfected blood and body fluids. HBV can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis\nand hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Screening is important, especially\nfor those at high risk. Non-invasive methods to assess liver fibrosis and cirrhosis e.g. the use\nof aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) testing have been validated in hepatitis B and are easily\nperformed. The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents\nthe main endpoint of current treatment strategies. Functional cure\nof hepatitis B is an optimal endpoint which is defined as sustained\nundetectable circulating HBsAg and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Additional indications for treatment include the prevention of motherto-child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and the\nprevention of HBV reactivation in patients requiring immunosuppression\nor chemotherapy. The long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)\nwith a high barrier to resistance, such as entecavir (ETV), tenofovir\ndisoproxil (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), represents the\ntreatment of choice.

LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS\n3.1 Screening Test\nScreening for HBV infection in adults, adolescents and children (>12\nmonths of age) is by detection of HBsAg using either rapid diagnostic\ntest (RDT) or laboratory-based immunoassays. CHB is defined as\npersistent HBV infection (the presence of detectable HBsAg in the\nblood for \u22656 months).1; 2, level III In Malaysia, HBV infection is a notifiable\ndisease under Prevention and Control on Infectious Disease Act 1988\nand should be notified within seven days of diagnosis.9, level III For those\nin high-risk group who are HBsAg-negative are advised to check for\nantibody to hepatitis B surface protein (anti-HBs) and considered for\nvaccination if anti-HBs is negative. Quality-assured RDT for HBsAg is recommended in settings where\nthere is limited access to laboratory testing and/or in populations\nwhere access to rapid testing would facilitate care and treatment. A\nmeta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of tests in HBsAg detection\ndemonstrated that RDT had pooled sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 89 to 91)\nand specificity of 99% (95% CI 99 to 100) with enzyme immunoassays\n(EIA) as the reference standard. The sensitivity varies widely overall\nand within brands of RDT and it was lower (72.3%, 95% CI 67.9 to 76.4)\nin HIV-positive individuals.10, level III\nScreening tests should meet the minimum acceptance criteria of\nWHO prequalification of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) or a stringent\nregulatory review for IVDs.

The prophylaxis should continue for at least\n12 months (18 months for rituximab-based regimens) after cessation of\nthe immunosuppressive treatment.13\nLiver function test (LFT) and HBV DNA should be tested every 3\n- 6 months during prophylaxis and for at least 12 months after NA\nwithdrawal as a large proportion of HBV reactivation (HBV-R) develops\nafter NA discontinuation.13\n\u2022 HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients\nA meta-analysis showed that HBV-R occurred in 6.5% of HBsAgnegative,\nanti-HBc-total-positive\npatients\nwho\nwere\nreceiving\nimmunosuppressive therapy. The risk of HBV-R was higher but nonsignificant in rituximab-containing regimens compared with rituximabfree regimens. Further analysis also showed HBV-R rate in the\nrituximab-free regimen was higher in patients with detectable HBV\nDNA compared with those without (RR=12.67, 95% CI 2.39 to 67.04). Apart from that, HBV-R risk was lower in anti-HBs-positive vs anti-HBsnegative at baseline in all patient subgroups:48, level I\n\uf0a1 hematological diseases (RR=0.29, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.46)\n\uf0a1 non-haematological diseases (RR=0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.76)\n\uf0a1 rituximab-containing regimens (RR=0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69)\n\uf0a1 rituximab-free regimens (RR=0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.96)\nAfter cessation of immunosuppression, HBV-R developed in 42% of\nthe rituximab-containing regimens group and 32% of rituximab-free\nregimens group. In another meta-analysis, the median time for HBV-R from the last\nrituximab dose was three months; it was at one month in anti-HBcpositive and five months in HBsAg-positive (p=0.021).", "chunk_order": 23}

However, prolonged\nManagement of Chronic Hepatitis B in Adults\nantiviral treatment raises concerns about increased treatment cost and,\nrisks of treatment non-adherence and AEs e.g. renal impairment, bone\nloss and virological resistance. In recent years, many studies have\nshown that antiviral treatment discontinuation may lead to a functional\ncure but contradicting results are seen in the following recent evidence. In an open-label RCT, NA discontinuation before HBsAg loss was\nshown to have limited benefits, especially for pre-treatment HBeAgpositive patients.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nHepatitis B is an infectious disease and the infected patients may need\nlife-long treatment. It is important to implement this CPG as guidance\nin providing quality healthcare services based on the best and latest\nevidence and expertise suited for local scenarios. 10.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:\ni. availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies)\nii. conferences and updates on the management of hepatitis B\nwhich may involve professional societies e.g. Malaysian Society\nof Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Malaysian Association of\nHIV Medicine, Obstetrical & Gynaecological Society of Malaysia,\nMalaysian Family Medicine Specialist Association, Malaysian\nPharmaceutical Society, etc. iii. hepatitis B programmes by MoH e.g. Elimination of Mother-to-Child\nTransmission (EMTCT) programme\niv. public awareness hepatitis campaign which may involve other\ngovernment agencies and non-governmental organisations e.g. World Hepatitis Day\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\ni. limited awareness and knowledge in the management of hepatitis B\namong healthcare providers\nii. different levels of hepatitis B care due to expertise, drugs, laboratory\nand radiology facilities\niii. challenges in managing hepatitis B patients with/in:\n\u2022 renal failure\n\u2022 immunosuppression\nManagement of Chronic Hepatitis B in Adults\n\u2022 on-going risk factors\n\u2022 antiviral resistance\niv. lack of surveillance programmes which includes a national registry,\netc. 10.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitments to:\ni. ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers via\nprinted copies and online accessibility\nii. reinforce training of healthcare providers via regular seminars and\nworkshops\niii.", "chunk_order": 40}

It involves an integrated and\ncoordinated approach to achieve elimination in an efficient, coordinated\nand sustainable manner. Malaysia has been certified as the first country\nin the region in EMTCT of HIV and syphilis. This is possible due to\nuniversal screening among pregnant mothers. The CPG recommends pregnant mothers in a high-risk group be\nscreened for hepatitis B. It also addresses the treatment of CHB mothers\nto prevent MTCT. Thus, in order to achieve triple elimination in EMTCT,\nit is important to screen universally pregnant mothers and treat them\naccordingly as recommended in the CPG. This would cause resource\nimplications in the health service but it has to be strongly considered to\nachieve the aim of EMTCT by 2030. To assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed\nas clinical audit indicators for quality management:\n*Target \u226570%\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of the\nCPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module (Available\nat: https://www.moh.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/3962?mid=1570). \u2022 Percentage of\npregnant mothers\nbeing screened for\nHBV within a year*\nTotal number of pregnant mothers\nin the same year\nNumber of pregnant mothers being\nscreened within a year\n=\nx100%\nManagement of Chronic Hepatitis B in Adults\nReferences\n1.
