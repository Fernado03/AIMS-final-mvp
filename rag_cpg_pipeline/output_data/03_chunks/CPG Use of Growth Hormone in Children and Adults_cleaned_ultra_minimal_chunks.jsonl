INTRODUCTION\nGrowth hormone (GH) has been used in clinical practice since 1950s. The initial source of GH was human cadaver pituitary extract. The\nsupply was scarce and the scope of GH usage then was limited only to\nchildren with proven GH de\ufb01ciency. In 1985, pituitary-derived GH was\nbanned because of its association with Creutzfeld Jacob disease. This\ntriggered an acceleration in the biosynthesis of GH via recombinant\nDNA technology. Today there is an abundant supply of biosynthetic GH\ncommercially. The use of GH has also expanded markedly beyond GH\nde\ufb01ciency to conditions without GH de\ufb01ciency where data regarding its\nef\ufb01cacy and safety in these conditions are still lacking. In Malaysia, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been\ncommercially available since 1985. However, despite its increased\navailability, many GH de\ufb01cient (GHD) children are still deprived of rhGH\ntherapy due to its high cost and concerns regarding its long-term safety. On the contrary, the broadening of scope of GH therapy also has its\ndrawbacks including its increasing use and abuse of GH in a broad\nvariety of growth disorders without evidence of GH de\ufb01ciency. rhGH therapy should not be taken lightly in view of its high cost, the\nneed of prolonged therapy with close follow up by practicing clinicians\nfamiliar with rhGH therapy, potential adverse effects and the negative\npsychological impact from unsuccessful therapy. In a 25 kg child, at low dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day, the cost of rhGH\napproximates RM950 per month (RM11,400 per year). The cost\nescalates as rhGH dose requirement increases and the child grows\nin stature reaching a hefty sum of more than RM2,000 per month. The duration of rhGH therapy could range from four to ten years for\noptimisation of linear growth to lifelong for severe childhood-onset or\nadult-onset GH de\ufb01ciency. In adults, the indications for GH therapy are well de\ufb01ned but the\nenthusiasm for rhGH use has also far exceeded medical evidence. Unlike\nthat in children, the lack of linear growth in adults renders response to\nrhGH therapy more dif\ufb01cult to measure. These CPG speci\ufb01cally aim\nto evaluate the scienti\ufb01c and clinical evidence of appropriate rhGH\nuse and abuse in order to put these \u201cindications\u201d into their respective\nscienti\ufb01c contexts.

The most common presentation of GH de\ufb01ciency in children is stunted\ngrowth. In view of a wide spectrum of causes of stunted growth in\nchildren, evaluation for GH de\ufb01ciency in a short child should not be\ninitiated until other causes of growth failure such as hypothyroidism,\nchronic systemic diseases, syndromic disorders including Turner\nsyndrome (TS) and skeletal disorders have been considered and\nappropriately excluded.

Height measurements may be imprecise due to errors\nrelated to operator and/or measuring tool. Errors can also occur in the\ncalculation of HV due to seasonal variation in growth and short time\ninterval between measurements. To minimise errors in HV, serial height\nmeasurements should be performed by a trained personnel, using an\nappropriate tool and a longer time interval between measurements\n(which should not be less than three months). However, Voss LD et al. showed no correlation between HV in two\nconsecutive years in short normal children and GHD children which\nindicated severe imprecision of HV.11, level II-2 Hintz also showed\nno signi\ufb01cant difference in height standard deviation score (SDS)\nand HV between GHD and idiopathic short stature (ISS).12, Level II-2\nUsing a HV less than 25th percentile to diagnose GH de\ufb01ciency has a\nhigh sensitivity (82%) but poor speci\ufb01city (43%).13, Level II-3 Hence using\nauxology alone is inadequate for the diagnosis of GHD. Auxology must\nbe interpreted in combination with other parameters. 2.1.2 Biochemical Tests\nGH stimulation tests play a critical role in diagnosis of GH de\ufb01ciency. The most frequently used tests include the insulin tolerance test (ITT)\nand glucagon stimulation test (GST). Other stimulation tests using\npharmacologic agents such as arginine, growth hormone-releasing\nhormone (GHRH) with or without arginine, levodopa and clonidine\nhave been used.14, Level II-2 In local setting, only ITT, GST and arginine\nstimulation test (AST) are used due to unavailability of other agents.

IGF-1 concentration level must be carefully interpreted\nas the values are speci\ufb01c but not sensitive. Many factors such as\nnutritional status, sex steroid, thyroid hormone and chronic diseases\naffect IGF-1 concentrations. IGFBP-3 is dependent on age and pubertal\nThe Use of Growth Hormone in Children and Adults\n6\nstatus. Hence reference ranges standardised for age and sex are\nimperative.16, Level III; 13, Level II-3\nThe dif\ufb01culty in diagnosing GH de\ufb01ciency during the peripubertal\nperiod is acknowledged, as low GH levels in stimulation tests frequently\noccur. Sex-steroid priming prior to GH stimulation tests reduces the\npercentage of false positive for GH de\ufb01ciency.17, Level 1; 18, Level II-3 Hence\nsex-steroid priming may play a role in reducing the number of false\npositive results in the peripubertal children. Children with MPHD should\nreceive adequate adrenal and thyroid hormone replacement before\nbiochemical evaluation of GH de\ufb01ciency. GH Testing in the neonate: GH level should be measured in the event\nof neonatal hypoglycemia in the absence of a metabolic disorder. A\nrandom GH measurement in a polyclonal radioimmunoassay of <20\nmcg/L would suggest GH de\ufb01ciency in the newborn. An IGFBP3 measurement is of value for the diagnosis of GHD infant.9, Level III\nITT is regarded as the gold standard for the evaluation of pituitary\ngrowth hormone reserve. In ITT, insulin is administered intravenously\nto produce a nadir in the plasma glucose level of \u2264 2.2 mmol/L. This\nis a potentially hazardous procedure and must be done only by an\nexperienced endocrinologist in a tertiary centre.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography\n(CT scan) of the brain with particular attention to the hypothalamicpituitary region should be carried out in any child diagnosed with\nGH de\ufb01ciency.

The overall increase was driven by a small excess number of second\nneoplasms in the subgroup of acute leukaemia survivors (RR= 4.98). This increase is of concern but the data needs to be interpreted with\ncaution given the small number of events.47, Level II-3 The elevation of risk\ndue to rhGH use appears to diminish with increasing length of follow\nup.69, Level II-3\nAll above reported studies have signi\ufb01cant limitations.

The median\nduration from onset of GH therapy to BIH ranged from 0.01 to 1.3\nyears.73, Level II-3\nBIH is known to occur in patients on rhGH therapy. c. Bone health\nDifferent studies reported different prevalence of scoliosis. The\nNCGS database (n=24,000) reported fewer than 1% of the patients\nhad scoliosis (prevalence of scoliosis in the general population was\nbetween 1.5 to 3.0%).63, Level II-3 In a retrospective study (n= 250) of\nchildren treated with rhGH, 4% developed scoliosis.74, Level II-3 A cohort\nstudy (OZGROW) showed that TS girls receiving rhGH therapy have a\nhigh prevalence of scoliosis (28%).75, Level II-2\nThe International Cooperative Growth Study (ICGS) demonstrated that\nPerthes\u2019 disease developed in 12 boys (69.9 per 100,000 patient-years). Neither recurrence nor aggravation of Perthes\u2019 disease was observed\nduring the rhGH therapy.76, Level II-3\nIn the ICGS database, slipped capital femoral epiphyses (SCFE)\ndeveloped in four cases with GHD and other pituitary hormones\nde\ufb01ciency during GH therapy (21.5 per 100,000 patient years).

Of the 43 who were con\ufb01rmed to have\nglucose disorders, 11 had type 1 diabetes (T1DM), 18 had T2DM and\n14 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). There was no increase in the\nincidence for T1DM but the incidence for T2DM (34 cases per 100,000\npatient-years) was approximately six-fold higher than in children not\ntreated with rhGH.50, Level II-3\nrhGH therapy decreases insulin sensitivity without impairing glucose\ntolerance. The risk of T2DM may be increased in individuals on rhGH therapy. e. Skin\nThere are concerns that rhGH may cause skin cancer in preexisting pigmented naevi. The NCGS database reported 13 cases of\nincrease in pigmented naevi during rhGH therapy.71, Level II-3 However,\nbiopsies have not detected neoplasia or pre-malignant naevi\ntransformations.63, Level II-3 Studies have shown that there were\nno difference in the naevi count between the children with GH\nde\ufb01ciency and control group despite many years of rhGH therapy.

USE OF GROWTH HORMONE IN TRANSITION PATIENT\nThe primary goal of rhGH therapy in children is to achieve a \ufb01nal height\n(FH) which is consistent with the target height (TH). It is a common\npractice to discontinue rhGH therapy after attainment of FH when\ngrowth is completed. This period of adolescence after attainment of FH\nuntil 6 to 7 years later (approximately from 17 to 25 years old) is termed\nthe transition period. This period encompasses a broad set of physical\nand psychosocial changes.136, level III\nThe new goal of rhGH therapy in the transition period is normalisation\nof metabolism and improvement in quality of life. 4.1\nWHO SHOULD CONTINUE GH THERAPY?

The diagnosis of GHD is\ncon\ufb01rmed by performing stimulation tests. Commonly used tests are\nITT, glucagon stimulation test, arginine with/without growth hormone\nreleasing hormone (GHRH) (ARG plus GHRH) test. Comparison of\nthese different diagnostic tests has shown that the ITT and ARG plus\nGHRH tests were better to differentiate between GHD patient from\nnormal persons.175, level III In the KIMS global database of adult GHD,\nthese two stimulation tests were the most commonly used.169, level II-3\nHowever, GHRH is not available in Malaysia.

(Grade A)\n6.5 SPORTS\nExogenous rhGH therapy has been touted as an athletic performance\nenhancer for many years and its use for such a purpose has been\nbanned by professional sports regulatory authorities. Liu H et al., in 2008, published a systematic review of 44 articles on the\neffects of GH on athletic performance. Overall, 303 subjects received\nrhGH therapy. They were young (mean age of 27 \u00b1 3 years), lean (mean\nBMI of 24 \u00b1 2 kg/m2) and physically \ufb01t (mean maximum oxygen uptake\nof 51 \u00b1 8 ml/kg/minute). GH dosage varied (mean dose of 36 \u00b1 21 mcg/\nkg/day) as did treatment duration (mean of 20 \u00b1 18 days). The review\nfound that although exogenous GH was associated with an increase\nin lean body mass (mean of 2.1 kg, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.9), there was no\nsigni\ufb01cant improvement in actual strength and exercise capacity. In\nfact, two out of three studies that measured exercising lactate levels\nshowed signi\ufb01cantly higher exercising lactate levels in rhGH-treated\nsubjects suggesting that GH therapy may worsen exercise capacity. rhGH treated subjects were more frequently experiencing adverse\nevents such as soft tissue oedema and fatigue compared to those not\ntreated with GH.216, level I\nRecommendation\nrhGH therapy should not be used to enhance athletic performance.

The single study\nwhich favoured the addition of GH was small and used historical\ncontrols.218, level II-I\nRecommendation\nrhGH therapy should not be used in the treatment of infertile women\nwith normal pituitary function. (Grade B)\n6.7 OBESITY\nIt is known that the endogenous secretion of GH in obese individuals\nis decreased although the exact physiological role of GH in obesity is\nunclear. A recent meta-analysis of 24 RCTs looked at the ef\ufb01cacy and safety\nof rhGH therapy in simple adult obesity (i.e. not associated with\ndistinct clinical syndromes). Treatment with very high dosages of rhGH\ntherapy led to very small improvement in waist-hip ratio and fat mass in\nsubjects treated with rhGH therapy compared to placebo. There were\nno signi\ufb01cant differences in body weight, BMI, subcutaneous fat area,\nresting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient and blood pressure. However, there were signi\ufb01cant increase in adverse events associated\nwith rhGH therapy including arthralgia, paraesthesias and oedema. The\nbene\ufb01cial effects appear to be quantitatively small and would not justify\na clinically relevant role for rhGH therapy in obesity.219, level I\nRecommendation\nrhGH therapy should not be used in the treatment of simple adult\nobesity.
