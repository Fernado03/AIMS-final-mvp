The evidence search was carried out using Pubmed, Ovid and general\nsearch engines with \u2018idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura\u2019; \u2018immune\nthrombocytopenic purpura\u2019; \u2018platelet count\u2019; autoimmune thrombocytopenic\npurpura\u2019; \u2018refractory thrombocytopenic purpura\u2019; ITP; thrombocytopenia AND\ntherapy as the key words. For paediatric AND pregnancy articles the previous\nsearch terms were combined with \u2018child\u2019 and \u2018children\u2019 and pregnancy\nrespectively. The search excluded secondary causes of ITP e.g. \u2018drug\ninduced thrombocytopenia\u2019; \u2018secondary immune thrombocytopenia\u2019. \u201cRelated articles were selected and out of these, relevant articles were\nchosen and graded using the modified version of those used by the Catalonia\nAgency for Health Technology Assessment (CAHTA) Spain. This guideline was also adapted from other international guidelines on\nManagement of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura which include\nGuidelines for the Investigation and Management of Idiopathic\nThrombocytopenic Purpura in Adults, Children and in Pregnancy by British\nSociety for Haematology and Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: A\npractice guideline by American Society of Haematology. This guideline is\nalso based on the findings of a systematic review of current medical\nliterature, taking into consideration local practices. The draft guideline was\nposted on both the Ministry of Health Malaysia and Academy of Medicine,\nMalaysia websites for comment and feedback. This guideline has also been\npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines and the Health Technology Assessment and Clinical Practice\nGuidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and approval. A systematic approach to the treatment modalities was suggested depending\non the conditions associated with ITP. This is summarised as an algorithm\nof management of ITP in adults, children and pregnancy.

REFERENCES\n25\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n34\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\n34\nSOURCES OF FUNDING\n1. INTRODUCTION\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) affects both children and adults. It\nis an autoimmune disorder characterised by persistent thrombocytopenia\n(peripheral platelet count of less than 150 x109/L) due to autoantibody binding\nto platelet antigen(s) causing their premature destruction by the reticuloendothelial system, in particular the spleen. In childhood, the peak age is 2-4 years, girls and boys are equally affected,\nand in most children the disease is self-limiting with spontaneous recovery\noccurring in several weeks to several months. In adults, ITP is most common\namong young women and the disease is more insidious in its onset and\nchronic in its course 1 Level 9. The true incidence of ITP is still unknown. In\nchildren, the overall incidence of ITP is 4 \u2013 5.3 per 100,000 2 Level 8 ; 3 Level 6. It\nhas been reported that the incidence of chronic adult ITP is around 5.8-6.6\nnew cases per 100,000 population per year in the USA 4 Level 9. 2. ITP IN ADULTS\n2.1\nClinical Features\nIn adults, ITP typically has an insidious onset, with no prodromal illness. Symptoms and signs are highly variable, ranging from the common\nasymptomatic patient with mild bruising or mucosal bleeding to frank\nhaemorrhage from any site, the most serious of which is intracranial. The most common manifestation in ITP is mucocutaneous bleeding with\npurpura, epistaxis, gingival bleeding and menorrhagia. Overall, bleeding\nsymptoms are uncommon unless the ITP is severe (platelet count < 30x109/\nl) 1 Level 9. The degree of bleeding is largely dependent on the platelet count\nand patients with platelet counts below 10x109/l (and usually below 5x109/l)\nare at greatest risk of bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage.", "chunk_order": 2}

The degree of bleeding is largely dependent on the platelet count\nand patients with platelet counts below 10x109/l (and usually below 5x109/l)\nare at greatest risk of bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage. 2.2\nDiagnosis\nThere is no gold standard diagnostic test to confirm ITP. The diagnosis of\nITP remains clinical and is based principally on the exclusion of other causes\nof thrombocytopenia by the history, physical examination, full blood count,\nperipheral blood film and autoimmune screen. a. Clinical\nITP can be defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with no clinically apparent\nassociated conditions or other causes of thrombocytopenia (e.g. HIV\ninfection, systemic lupus erythematosus, lymphoproliferative disorders,\nmyelodysplasia, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, congenital/hereditary nonimmune thrombocytopenia, or pregnancy) 5 Level 9. Patients with isolated abnormalities on serologic tests (e.g. positive tests\nfor antinuclear or antiphospholipid antibodies) but without a clinically evident\ndisorder (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus) are included within the\ndiagnosis of ITP 6 Level 8 ; 7 Level 8. Patients with thrombocytopenia and an associated clinically apparent\nautoimmune disease may have an illness comparable to ITP. Lists of\nconditions which must be considered and excluded in the diagnostic\nevaluation of a patient with suspected ITP are as in Table 1. Table 1: Differential Diagnoses\nFalsely low platelet count\nIn vitro platelet clumping caused by EDTA-dependent or colddependent agglutinins. Common causes of thrombocytopenia\nPregnancy (gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia)\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia (common drugs include heparin,\nquinidine, quinine, and sulfonamides)\nViral infections, e.g. HIV, infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis\nHypersplenism due to liver disease\nOther causes of thrombocytopenia that mimic ITP\nMyelodysplasia\nCongenital thrombocytopenia eg. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, von\nWillebrand disease type 2B\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-Haemolytic uremic\nsyndrome\nChronic disseminated intravascular coagulation\nThrombocytopenia associated with other disorders\nAutoimmune diseases eg. systemic lupus erythematosus\nLymphoproliferative disorders eg. chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,\nnon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\nAdopted with permission from George et al 1998. b. Laboratory\nThe finding of thrombocytopenia on a routine blood count may be the first\nindication of immune thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia needs to be confirmed on peripheral blood film\nexamination to exclude pseudo-thrombocytopenia. Pseudo-thrombocytopenia\ndue to EDTA-dependent platelet agglutination is a cause of spuriously low\nplatelet count. This condition occurs in about 0.1% of adults, and is easily\nconfirmed by the finding of a normal platelet count using a sample taken in\ncitrate or heparin rather than EDTA anticoagulant 8 Level 9. An autoimmune screen should be carried out to exclude other autoimmune\ndiseases which may be associated with thrombocytopenia, e.g. systemic\nlupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome. HIV antibody testing\nshould also be done in patients with risk factors for HIV infection 5 Level 9.", "chunk_order": 3}

If the history, physical examination, blood count and peripheral blood film\nexamination are compatible with a diagnosis of ITP and do not include\natypical findings, additional investigations such as bone marrow examination\nand assays for platelet antibodies are not indicated 5 Level 9. Recommendations: Indications for Bone Marrow Examination\n-\nover 60 years of age\n-\nprior to splenectomy\n-\npresence of atypical features\n-\npoor response to first line treatment (eg. prednisolone) 5 Level 9\n(Grade C)\n-\nrelapsed ITP following complete remission 9 Level 8\n(Grade C)\nAssays for anti-platelet antibodies such as direct platelet\nimmunofluorescence test (PIFT) and assays for antibodies to specific\nplatelet membrane glycoproteins (GP) IIb/IIIa and Ib/IX are not sensitive or\nspecific enough to be recommended as routine tests in the diagnosis of\nITP 10 Level 8 ; 11 Level 8. However, these tests may be useful in distinguishing between immune and\nnon-immune thrombocytopenia in complex cases such as combination of\nbone marrow failure associated with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia,\nITP patients refractory to first and second line treatment, drug-dependent\nimmune thrombocytopenia, miscellaneous disorders (rare) e.g. monoclonal\ngammopathies and acquired auto-antibody mediated thrombasthenia 5 Level 9. 2.3\nManagement of Chronic ITP\nMost adults with ITP have a good outcome except for a small subset that\nhas severe symptomatic ITP. Eighty-five percent of patients who had platelet\n>30x 109/L had long term mortality risk equal to the general population\neven without treatment. Patients who suffered major bleeding during their\nfollow up had median platelet counts of 10x 109/L 12, Level 6. These findings favour treating patients with platelet count <30x 109/L and/\nor symptomatic ITP. This will reduce the risks of infection through\nimmunosuppression 12 level 6; 13 , Level 6 ; 14 , Level 8. Recommendations : When to Treat\nPatients with platelet counts exceeding 30 x 109/L require no treatment. Treat when symptomatic or when platelet count < 30x109/L unless\nthey are undergoing surgical procedures\n(Grade C)\n\u2018Safe\u2019 Platelet Thresholds for Procedures\nPlatelet counts considered \u201csafe\u201d in adults undergoing procedures :\nDentistry > 10 x 109/L\nExtractions > 30 x 109/L\nRegional dental block > 30 x 109/L\nMinor surgery > 50 x 109/L\nMajor surgery > 80 x 109/L\n(Grade C)\na.

First Line Treatment\ni. Corticosteroid\nTwo thirds of patients will respond to prednisolone at 1mg/kg body weight/\nday for 2-4 weeks 15 Level 9; 16 Level 8. However long term remission is seen only\nin 10-20% of patients 16 Level 6; 17 Level 8. The response to oral steroids is slower compared to intravenous\nmethylprednisolone 18 Level 3. ii. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)\nIVIG is effective in elevating the platelet count in 75% of patients, of whom\n50% will achieve normal platelet counts. However the responses are\ntransient lasting between 3 to 4 weeks 19, Level 9. Combination of IVIG/ oral\nprednisolone seemed to be more effective than IV methylprednisolone/ oral\nprednisolone in adults with severe ITP 20, Level 2. There is no difference\nbetween the two dosing of IVIG 0.4g /kg/day for 5 days and 1 g/kg/day for\ntwo days 21, Level 2. Adverse effects with intravenous immunoglobulin are common but generally\nmild including fever, chills, rigors, headache and backache 20, Level 2. Recommendations : First Line Therapy in Adults\nOral corticosteroids are used as first line therapy at 1 mg/kg body\nweight /day (max 60 mg) for 2-4 weeks tapering off over several weeks\n(Grade B). Intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg body weight/day with total\nmaximum daily dose of 1 gram for 3 days) is an alternative to oral\nprednisolone where more rapid response is required\n(Grade B). Intravenous immunoglobulin (1g/ kg body weight /day for 2 days or\n0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) is useful in severe ITP who require rapid rise\nof platelet count. (Grade A)\nb. Second Line Treatment\ni. Splenectomy\nSplenectomy is considered as second line therapy with two thirds of patients\nachieving a complete remission 22 Level 8; 16 Level 8; 23 Level 8; 24 Level 8; 25 Level 8; 5 Level 9; 26\nLevel 9. The rest will experience a lesser increase or only transient\nnormalization of platelet counts. Most relapses occur within the first 6 months\nafter splenectomy, however, a small percentage of patients continue to\nrelapse thereafter 16 Level 8; 27 Level 8. Predicting response to splenectomy\nThere are conflicting data on the predictive value of the response to steroids\n28 Level 8; 29 Level 8; 30 Level 8; 31 Level 8; 32 Level 8; 23 Level 8 and IVIG 33 Level 8; 34 Level 8; 30 Level 8; 29\nLevel 8; 35 Level 8; 23 Level 8; 32 Level 8 on splenectomy but in general they do not have\na high predictive value.", "chunk_order": 5}

The most sensitive indicator of response to splenectomy is the indiumlabelled autologous platelet scanning with more than 90% response if\nplatelet destruction is primarily in the spleen 36 Level 8. However, platelet\nsequestration studies are difficult to perform and currently not available in\nMalaysia. The timing of splenectomy does not appear to affect the response rate 22\nLevel 8; 36 Level 8; 30 Level 8; 31 Level 8; 23 Level 8; 32 Level 8. Post-operative complications\nSplenectomized patients have a small risk for overwhelming sepsis with an\nestimated mortality rate of 1.2% 37 Level 1. Operative mortality rates are < 2 % in most series 38 Level 8; 12 Level 8; 24 Level 8. Recommendations : Prevention of Post Splenectomy Sepsis\nAt least 2 weeks before surgery, the patient should be immunized with a\npolyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, Hemophilus influenzae b (Hib)\nconjugate vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. (Grade B)\nA booster dose of pneumococcal vaccine should be given every 5\nyears. (Grade B)\nProphylactic antibiotics with oral penicillin 250 mg bd or erythromycin\n500 mg bd should be given. (Grade C)\nThe optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis is still uncertain (Grade\nC) but is recommended lifelong in the UK guidelines. (Grade C )\nAccessory spleen\nThe presence of an accessory spleen should be considered in patients\nwho fail to respond to splenectomy or relapse following an initial response. ii. Danazol\nResponse can be as high as 60% especially in older females and those who\nhave undergone splenectomy 39 Level 5. It is used as a steroid-sparing agent in\nsteroid responsive patients who require longer term high dose steroids or in\npatients who are refractory to steroids. The usual dose is 200 mg 2-4 times\ndaily 39 Level 5 and a trial of at least 6 months should be allowed. iii. Azathioprine\nApproximately 20% of patients may achieve a sustained complete response\nwith this agent while 30 to 40% may have a partial response 40 Level 9. The\nrecommended dose for ITP is 2 mg/kg/day usually up to a maximum of\n150mg/day 26 Level 9. The treatment should be continued for up to 4 to 6\nmonths before a patient is considered non-responsive 41 Level 8; 42 Level 8. Azathioprine is associated with few side effects, even with prolonged use 43\nLevel 9; 41 Level 8. The potential side effects include a reversible leucopenia and\nelevated transaminases.", "chunk_order": 6}

Secondary malignancies and myelodysplastic\nsyndrome have been reported 44 Level 9. iv. Dapsone\nResponses are seen in 50% of patient with platelet counts < 50 x109/L with\nsustained responses in 25% of patients. Half of all patients with chronic\nITP treated with dapsone will show some response within 3 weeks 45 Level 3. It is less effective in severe cases especially those who have undergone\nsplenectomy 46 Level 4. The usual dose is 75-100 mg orally 45 Level 3. v. Anti-D\nThis is effective only in Rh(D) positive non-splenectomized patients with\nresponse rate of up to 75 to 90% of adults with ITP. The effect last for more\nthan 3 weeks in 50% of responders 47 Level 8. The usual dose is 50-75mcg/\nkg 48 Level 8; 47 Level 8; 49 Level 8. However this drug is not readily available in Malaysia. Recommendations : Second Line Therapy in Adults\nPatients not responding to steroids or requiring persistently high doses\nrequire second line therapy. The choice of therapy must be\nindividualized. The treatment options are:\n-\nSplenectomy. -\nDanazol\n-\nAzathioprine\n-\nDapsone\n-\nAnti-D\nGrade C\nc. Refractory ITP\nRefractory ITP is defined as failure to respond to first or second line treatment. This group accounts for 5.6% of all patients with ITP and are expected to\nhave the worst outcome with a 4.2 fold increased mortality risk 12 Level 6. The cornerstone of management is to raise the platelet counts to a safe\nlevel of more than 30 X 109/L taking into account coexisting risk factors for\nbleeding, patient\u2019s level of acceptance of modifications in lifestyle, tolerance\nor lack of tolerance to treatment, and the potential toxic effects of each\nintervention 12 Level 6.

High Dose Methylprednisolone\nTwo studies have shown that high dose methylprednisolone is effective in\nthe treatment of patients with refractory ITP 53 Level 9; 18 Level 3. v. Cyclosporin A\nCyclosporin A can be used as monotherapy or in combination with steroids. Two small case series reported responses between 50-80% 54 level 8; 55 Level 8. The cyclosporin dose is between 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day in divided doses. The\npatient should be treated for at least 4 weeks before a response can be\nobserved. The side effects may limit widespread practical use. vi. Mycophenolate Mofetil\nMycophenolate mofetil had been shown to be of value in some patients\nwith autoimmune cytopenias including refractory ITP 56 Level 8; 57 Level 5 with\noverall response of 62%.

The serious consequences\nof severe, life-threatening bleeding justify the use of several regimens. Appropriate interventions include platelet transfusions, high-dose parenteral\nglucocorticoid (e.g. methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg daily for 3 days), and\nIVIG, either alone or in combination with corticosteroids 26 Level 9. Conditions requiring urgent treatment in adults with ITP are:\n1. active bleeding from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts\n2. intracranial bleed\n3. bleeding into important structures e.g. upper airway\nThe aims of treatment are to elevate platelet count quickly (within 24 hours)\nand to arrest bleeding. Recommendations : Emergency treatment\n1. i.v. methylprednisolone 500mg to 1g/day for 3 days\n2. IVIG 1g/kg/day for 2 consecutive days\n3. Platelet transfusion\nEmergency splenectomy is considered if above measures fail to\nincrease platelet count to safe level i.e. above 50x109/L. (Grade C)\nIndications for platelet transfusion in ITP\nPlatelet transfusion in ITP is only given in the following situations:\n1. life-threatening haemorrhage e.g. intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)\n2. severe thrombocytopenia < 10 x 109/L and patient has to undergo an\nemergency surgery\nHigh dose i.v. steroids and IVIG must also be given together to raise the\nplatelet counts and to stop the haemorrhage.

ITP IN CHILDREN\nIn children, ITP is usually an acute, self-limiting disorder that resolves\nspontaneously. The clinical onset is usually acute, with a spectrum of\nbleeding severity ranging from superficial (petechiae, purpura) to lifethreatening. Hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy is absent. The\nmajority will give a history of a viral infection in the preceding 2-4 weeks. 75% of patients remit spontaneously with 70% achieving platelet count of\nmore than 50 x109/L by the fourth week of illness 67 Level 9. The diagnosis can be made clinically based principally on the history,\nphysical examination (no stigmata of malignant disease or congenital\nthrombocytopenia), full blood count (isolated thrombocytopenia), and\nexamination of the peripheral blood smear (exclude abnormal cells).

Precaution with physical activities, avoidance\nof contact sports and seeking immediate medical attention if bleeding occurs should\nbe advised 69 Level 9. A repeat platelet count should be performed within the first 7-10\ndays to ensure there is no evidence of a serious evolving marrow condition. Otherwise, the count can be repeated only when clinically indicated 69 Level 9.

There is a wide\nspectrum of manifestations. However, there is insufficient evidence in the\nliterature to determine the best management for these patients 77 Level 9. As far as possible, allow the disease to remit spontaneously. However, other\ncauses of thrombocytopenia e.g. SLE should be considered. Asymptomatic\npatients can be left without therapy with advice regarding precautions during\nphysical activities, contact sports, dental/surgical procedures and menses. Symptomatic children may need short courses of treatment (as for acute\nITP) during periods of \u201crelapse\u201d or for surgical procedures.

However, splenectomy is justified when there is a life threatening bleeding\nevent or severe lifestyle restrictions and where there has been no or only\ntransient success with intermittent IVIG, pulsed steroids or anti-D 82 Level 9. Up to 70% of children achieve complete remission post-splenectomy 83 Level 6. It is important to ensure pre-splenectomy immunization against\npneumococcus, haemophilus and meningococcus .

Management in labour\nPlatelet count above 50 x 109/L is safe for caesarian section under general\nanaesthesia but not epidural anaesthesia. Epidural anaesthesia is best\navoided because of the risk of epidural haematoma and cord compression. However, patients who prefer epidural analgesia need to be admitted earlier\nfor IVIG infusion in order to raise the platelet counts to a safe level >80 x 109/L\n104 Level 9. If platelet counts are less than 50 x 109/L and patient requires immediate\ncaesarian delivery, administer IVIG and methylprednisolone. Give platelet\ntransfusion just prior to surgery. \u2018Safe\u2019 Platelet Thresholds for delivery\n\u2022\nvaginal delivery:\n> 30 x 109/L\n\u2022\ncaesarean section:\n> 50 x 109/L\n\u2022\nepidural anaesthesia:\n> 80 x 109/L\n(Grade C)\n5. NEONATAL CARE\nThe overall incidence of thrombocytopenia in newborns born to mothers with\nITP is reported to vary from 14.3 to 37.5% 110 Level 8; 111 Level 8. Severe\nthrombocytopenia (<50 X 109/l) occurs in 8.9 to 14.7% 48 Level 8; 112 Level 8. Bleeding\nis fortunately a rare event 113 level 8 with overall incidence of intracranial\nhaemorrhage about 0 to 1.5% 48 Level 8. Prediction of neonatal thrombocytopenia is difficult, and there is no relationship\nwith maternal platelet counts. Infants from splenectomized mothers were\nmore likely to have thrombocytopenia 110 Level 8; 113 Level 8 as were mothers who\nhad presence of circulating antiplatelet antibody 110 Level 8. Thrombocytopenia\nis more likely if there is a previous sibling with thrombocytopenia 115 Level 8. Cordocentesis and foetal scalp sampling to measure foetal platelet counts\ncarry more risks than potential benefits and are not recommended 26 Level 9. The application of scalp electrodes for monitoring in labour should be avoided\n26 Level 9. Cord blood platelet count should be done and the neonate with\nthrombocytopenia should be monitored daily. The platelet counts reach a\nnadir on days 2 to 5 116 Level 8. Severe thrombocytopenia (<20 X 109/L) or clinical haemorrhage can be treated\nwith IVIG with good response in 75% of patients 117 Level 8. Life threatening\ncomplications should be treated with immediate platelet transfusions and\nIVIG 26 Level 9. Recommendations : Management of Neonates Born to Mothers\nwith ITP\nThe neonatology team should be alerted prior to delivery. (Grade C).
