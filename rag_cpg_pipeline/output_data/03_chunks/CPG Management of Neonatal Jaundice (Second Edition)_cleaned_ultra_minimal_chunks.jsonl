Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were issued in 2015 and will be reviewed in 2019 or\nsooner if new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating,\nthe Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty\nwill be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for\na revision including the scope of the revised CPG.

There was active involvement of a\nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. The previous CPG entitled Management of Jaundice in Healthy Term\nNewborns 2003 was used as the basis for the development of the\npresent guidelines. A literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N); Medline\nvia Ovid, Pubmed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews\n(CDSR) (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The\ninclusion criteria are all literature on neonatal jaundice occurring less\nthan two weeks, regardless of study design. The search was limited\nto literature published in the last ten years, humans and in English. In\naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were\nsearched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were\nalso contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom 29 May 2013 to 23 June 2014. Literature searches were repeated\nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process\nallowing any relevant papers published before 31 August 2014 to be\nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after\nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to other CPG on neonatal jaundice developed\nby National Collaborating Centre for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health\n(2010)/National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)\n(2010) and American Academy of Pediatrics (2004 and 2009).", "chunk_order": 1}

The\nCPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. A total of 14 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within these\nsections. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions) The DG\nmembers met 18 times throughout the development of these guidelines. The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion\nwere resolved consensually. These guidelines were based largely on\nManagement of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\nthe findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials,\nwith local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). On completion, the draft guidelines was reviewed by external reviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback\nfrom interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MoH\nMalaysia for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nNeonatal Jaundice (NNJ) or neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is one of the\nmost common medical conditions in newborn babies. All babies have a\ntransient rise in serum bilirubin but only about 75% are visibly jaundiced. Jaundice is clinically detectable when the serum bilirubin levels are >85\n\u03bcmol/L (5 mg/dl). NNJ is more common among Asian babies and varies\nwith races. There are also other risk factors that may be associated\nwith severe jaundice including prematurity, G6PD deficiency and ABO\nincompatibility. Due to improving survival rates of preterm babies, and\nbetter identification of risk factors over the years, there is a need to\naddress the management of jaundice in this group of babies. Hyperbilirubinaemia is either unconjugated or conjugated. Without\ntreatment, high levels of unconjugated bilirubin may lead to acute and\nchronic bilirubin encephalopathy. This may cause to neurodevelopmental\nproblems including athetoid cerebral palsy, hearing loss and visual\nimpairment.", "chunk_order": 4}

The CPG on the Management of Jaundice in Healthy Term Newborns\nwas developed in 2003 as a guide to clinical practice, based on the\nbest available evidence at that time. Since then, novel techniques in\nthe assessment of NNJ, different modalities of treatment and newer\nconcepts of prevention have been introduced. Based on recent evidence,\nthis CPG aims to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision-making\nand to provide a standard framework for the management of NNJ in\nthe country. Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\n2. RISK FACTORS\nPhysiological jaundice in babies:\n\u2022 is due to excessive bilirubin production (higher haemoglobin content\nand shorter red blood cell life span in newborn babies) and poor\nbilirubin clearance (liver immaturity)\n\u2022 usually appears two to four days after birth, resolving after one to\ntwo weeks (three weeks if preterm)\n\u2022 is not associated with underlying disease and is usually benign\nRisk factors of severe NNJ are:-\n\u2022 prematurity\n\u2022 low birth weight\n\u2022 jaundice in the first 24 hours of life\n\u2022 mother with Blood Group O or Rhesus Negative\n\u2022 G6PD deficiency\n\u2022 rapid rise of total serum bilirubin\n\u2022 sepsis\n\u2022 lactation failure in exclusive breastfeeding\n\u2022 high predischarge bilirubin level\n\u2022 cephalhaematoma or bruises\n\u2022 babies of diabetic mothers\n\u2022 family history of severe NNJ in siblings\nPhysiological jaundice is usually benign and occurs in almost all\nbabies. It can be exacerbated by certain conditions such as inadequate\nintake, cephalohaematoma and bruises. However, high levels of\nbilirubin can lead to bilirubin encephalopathy. Therefore, it is important\nto identify babies at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and adverse\nneurodevelopmental sequelae. Babies are more likely to develop\nsevere hyperbilirubinaemia if they have any of the following factors:\ni. Low gestational age/late preterm\nNNJ is common among babies delivered <37 weeks of gestation\n(p<0.0001).1 - 2, level II-2 Babies born at 38 to 39 weeks gestation have\nhigher risk for developing severe NNJ compared with babies of \u226540\nweeks gestation (OR=3.12, 95% CI 1.21 to 8.03).3, level II-2\nii. Low birth weight\nIn extremely low birth weight (ELBW) babies, an increasing level\nof unconjugated bilirubin increases mortality and risk of adverse\nneurodevelopmental outcomes (moderate to severe cerebral palsy,\nblindness, severe bilateral central hearing loss or poor mental\ndevelopmental or psychomotor developmental index) (OR=1.18,\n95% CI 1.02 to 1.38).4, level II-2\nManagement of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\niii.", "chunk_order": 5}

Visible jaundice in the first 24 hours of life\nJaundice developing within the first 24 hours after birth is an\nimportant risk factor for severe hyperbilirubinaemia.5 - 6\niv. Mother with Blood Group O or Rhesus Negative\nBabies with rhesus incompatibility have increased risk of bilirubin\nencephalopathy.7, level III Babies with ABO incompatibility and a\npositive direct Coombs test have a greater risk for adverse outcome\nthan those with a negative test (OR=4.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 15.4).8, level II-2\nv. G6PD deficiency\nIn a study of babies with total serum bilirubin (TSB)>20 mg/dL\n(>340 \u00b5mol/L), G6PD-deficient babies had higher peak TSB levels\n(p<0.001), were more likely to require phototherapy (p=0.004) or\nexchange transfusion (ET) (p<0.01) and had a higher mortality rate\n(p<0.05) compared to non-G6PD-deficient babies.1, level II-2; 8, level II-2\nvi. Rapid rise of total serum bilirubin (TSB)\nBabies with a rapid rise of TSB greater than 6 mg/dL/day (103\n\u00b5mol/L/day) are at risk of developing severe hyperbilirubinaemia\n(OR=2.94, 95% CI 1.46 to 5.92).3, level II-2\nvii. Presence of sepsis\nIn a study among babies >34 weeks, proven sepsis greatly increased\nthe risk of bilirubin toxicity (OR=20.6. 95% CI 4.9 to 87.5).7, level III\nviii. Excessive weight loss\nExcessive body weight loss in the first three days after birth is a\npredictor for significant hyperbilirubinaemia.9, level II-2\nRefer to Subchapter 5.1 on Weight loss\nix. Exclusive breastfeeding\nUsing multivariate analysis, exclusive breastfeeding is a significant\npredictor of TSB \u226525 mg/dL (425 \u00b5mol/L) with OR=2.03 (95% CI\n1.03 to 3.99).3, level II-2\nRefer to Chapter 12 on Impact of breastfeeding\nx. High predischarge bilirubin level\nA high predischarge bilirubin level is a predictor for development of\nsignificant hyperbilirubinaemia with AUC ranging between 0.86 and\n0.88.10 - 11, level II-2\nRefer to Nomogram in Appendix 5. xi. Cephalhaematoma or bruises\nBabies with cephalhaematomas or bruises are at risk for\nNNJ.3, level II-2; 6\nManagement of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\nxii. Babies of diabetic mothers\nMacrosomic babies of diabetic mothers are at risk factor for NNJ.12\nxiii.

Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\n3. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BILIRUBIN LEVEL, ACUTE BILIRUBIN\nENCEPHALOPATHY AND KERNICTERUS\nAcute Bilirubin Encephalopathy (ABE)\nABE results in changes of mental (behavioural) status and muscle tone\nduring the neonatal period when the baby is having hyperbilirubinaemia. These include drowsiness, poor feeding and hypotonia followed\nby hypertonia affecting extensor muscles in particular, resulting in\nretrocollis and opisthotonos.14\nClassic kernicterus\nClassic kernicterus may be seen in babies who survive from ABE. The manifestations of ABE include dystonia, athetoid cerebral palsy,\nparalysis of upward gaze, and sensorineural hearing loss. Post-mortem\nicteric (yellow) staining of the basal ganglia, specifically the globus\npallidus is the hallmark of this condition.14\nBilirubin-Induced Neurologic Dysfunction (BIND)\nBIND is a wider spectrum of disorders that not only includes classic\nkernicterus and ABE, but also less severe forms of neuropathy,\nincluding auditory neuropathy, fine and gross motor incoordination, gait\nabnormalities, fine tremors, exaggerated extrapyramidal reflexes and\nbehavioural problems.14\nKernicterus is a rare condition due to severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. It is associated with a high mortality, and survivors usually suffer\nsequelae such as athetoid cerebral palsy, intellectual disability and\nhigh frequency hearing loss.

METHODS OF DETECTING JAUNDICE AND ASSESSING ITS\nSEVERITY\nTSB measurement is the gold standard for detecting and determining the\nlevel of hyperbilirubinaemia. Visual assessment using Kramer\u2019s rule is\nstill widely practised. Newer, non-invasive methods like transcutaneous\nbilirubinometry have been introduced and are gaining wide acceptance. i. Transcutaneous bilirubinometer (TcB)\nThe transcutaneous bilirubinometer is a hand-held device that\nmeasures the amount of bilirubin in the skin. \u2022\nMany studies, including a large health technology assessment,\nshowed a significant correlation (r ranging from 0.75 to 0.95)\nbetween bilirubin measurements taken by TcBs (BiliCheck\nand JM 103), with TSB measurements, in both term and\npreterm babies. However, the TcBs tended to overestimate or\nunderestimate the bilirubin concentration when compared to\nTSB.19, level II-2; 20 - 23, level III Overestimation can lead to unnecessary\ninvasive investigations and treatment. Underestimation, on the\nother hand, can lead to missing babies at risk for developing\nsevere hyperbilirubinaemia. \u2022\nTcB measurements have good correlation (r ranging from 0.85\nto 0.97) with TSB measured by different types of chemistry\nanalysers.24 - 26, level III However the mean differences between the\nTcB and TSB levels vary with each method 24 - 25, level III and TcB\nmeasurement sites (sternum or forehead).25, level III\n\u2022\nMean differences between TcB measurements and TSB levels\nare large when the bilirubin levels exceed 205 \u00b5mol/L (12 mg/\ndL).19, level II-2; 26 - 27, level III\n\u2022\nThere has not been any major adverse effect associated with the\nuse of BiliCheck and JM-103 devices.19, level II-2\n\u2022\nJM-103 as compared to Bilicheck offers some practical advantages.", "chunk_order": 8}

Visual assessment\nVisual assessment of jaundice is based on the assessment of\nthe extent and severity of yellow discolouration of the skin. It is\nperformed by blanching the skin with slight finger pressure and\nnoting the underlying colour of the skin. Jaundice is usually visible\nwhen bilirubin levels are about 5 - 7 mg/dL (86 - 120 \u00b5mol/L) and\nprogresses from head to toe as the level of bilirubin rises. Kramer\u2019s\nrule describes the relationship between serum bilirubin levels\nand the progression of skin discolouration (refer to Table 1 and\nFigure 1).

Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\n7. PHOTOTHERAPY\nPhototherapy is the mainstay of treatment in NNJ. There are many\ntypes of devices that can be used to provide phototherapy such as\nfluorescent tubes, Light Emitting Diode (LED), fibreoptic and halogen\nbulbs. Effective phototherapy consists of:\n\u2022 blue light range (400 - 500 nm)\n\u2022 irradiance of minimum of 15 \u00b5W/cm\u00b2/nm for conventional phototherapy\n\u2022 irradiance of minimum of 30 \u00b5W/cm\u00b2/nm for intensive phototherapy\n\u2022 distance of the light source not exceeding 30 - 50 cm from the baby\ni. Type of phototherapy\na. LED phototherapy\nIn two meta-analyses, phototherapy based on LED and non-LED\nlight sources showed similar clinical efficacy as measured by duration\nof phototherapy and rate of decline of TSB in term and late preterm\nbabies.56 - 57, level I\nIn preterm babies, the use of LED has a similar rate of decline but\nsignificantly shorter duration of phototherapy compared with a nonLED light source.57, level I LED phototherapy does not induce significant\nalterations on transepidermal water loss and cerebral blood perfusion\nwhen compared to conventional phototherapy.58, level I\nNo study reported any major complications of LED phototherapy.56, level I\nb. Fibreoptic phototherapy\nFibreoptic phototherapy units are less commonly used compared with\nconventional/LED phototherapy. Common fibreoptic phototherapy units\nused in studies include Biliblanket and Wallaby II. A Cochrane systematic review showed that:59, level I\n\u2022 In preterm babies, fibreoptic phototherapy was as efficacious as\nconventional phototherapy in terms of duration of phototherapy\nand percentage of serum bilirubin change in 24 hours.", "chunk_order": 15}

Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\nii. Methods of administration\nVarious methods of providing phototherapy have been used in order to\nmaximise the effectiveness of phototherapy especially in babies with\nhigh serum bilirubin. a. Use of reflecting curtains\nWhite reflecting curtains significantly reduces TSB levels after four\nhours of phototherapy and shortens median duration of phototherapy\nby 22 hours.60, level I\nThe use of reflecting curtains shortens the duration of phototherapy and\nachieves a faster reduction of TSB, although these were not statistically\nsignificant.61, level I\nThe effectiveness of reflecting curtains in phototherapy depends on the\nmaterial and type of curtain used. However, the use of curtains may\nimpair observation of the babies. b. Changing positions during phototherapy\nThere is no difference in the fall of TSB by changing baby\u2019s position\n(supine/prone vs supine alone) while receiving phototherapy.62, level I\nIn clinical practice, the supine position is preferred because the prone\nposition is associated with and increased risk of sudden infant death\nsyndrome. c. Double vs triple phototherapy\nThere is no difference in the rate of bilirubin decline and length\nof hospital stay between double and triple phototherapy in term\nbabies.63, level I\nEffective phototherapy is achieved with optimal irradiance and\nadequately exposed body surface area rather than the number of\nphototherapy units. d. Overhead vs underneath LED phototherapy\nDuration of phototherapy is shorter and rate of decrease in TSB is more\nrapid in overhead LED compared to underneath LED with no erythema\nor any other complications in both groups.64, level II - 1\ne. Aggressive vs conservative phototherapy\nThere is a reduction in neurodevelopment impairment (especially\nprofound impairment) in aggressive phototherapy on ELBW babies\nespecially \u2265750 g, when babies are started on phototherapy at TSB\n85 \u00b5mol/L (5 mg/dL) in the first week of life and 120 \u00b5mol/L (7 mg/dL)\nduring the second week of life.65, level I However, there is a need for more\nvigilance in babies with birth weight under 750 g as there is a higher\nrisk of transepidermal water loss.

Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\nf. Prophylactic phototherapy for preventing jaundice\nIn a Cochrane systematic review, prophylactic phototherapy (i.e. initiation of phototherapy before TSB reached a pre-specified level)\nin preterm and LBW babies reduced ET by 78%, reduced rate of\nneurodevelopmental impairment (mainly severe hearing loss and\nmoderate/severe cerebral palsy) at 18 - 22 months by 15% and had\nlower peak TSB during first seven days of life compared to control\ngroup.66, level I\ng. Fluid management\nPresently, there is no good evidence to advocate extra fluids in the\nmanagement of NNJ. Recommendation 7\n\u2022 Phototherapy should be commenced when total serum bilirubin\nreaches the phototherapy threshold for neonatal jaundice*. \u2022 Irradiance of phototherapy units (non-Light Emitting Diode) should be\nregularly checked. \u2022 Overhead phototherapy is preferred to underneath phototherapy. \u2022 Babies should be placed in the supine position with adequate\nexposure. \u2022 Phototherapy should be started at a lower threshold in preterm and\nlow birth weight babies. \u2022 Light Emitting Diode phototherapy is preferred in preterm babies. *Refer to Chapters on Risk Factors and Indications for Treatment. Care of babies during phototherapy\n\u2022 Babies should be regularly monitored for vital signs including\ntemperature and hydration status. \u2022 Babies should be adequately exposed. \u2022 Babies\u2019 eyes should be covered to prevent retinal damage. \u2022 Breastfeeding should be continued. Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\n8. EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION\nET is indicated when the TSB is above the recommended levels (refer\nto Table 3 and Appendix 3). ET is efficacious in reducing TSB levels by 45%. Amongst those who\nhave undergone ET, 93% have TSB levels below 342 \u00b5mol/L (20 mg/\ndL) after the procedure.67, level III\nThere are various methods used in performing ET. These include\nfemoral vein (FV), umbilical vein (UV), umbilical artery/vein (UA/V)\nand peripheral artery (radial artery)/peripheral vein. All methods are\ncomparable in terms of efficacy.68 - 69, level III With regard to safety, ET via\nUA/V route have significantly increased incidence of thrombocytopenia\nwhen compared to FV and UV.68, level III\nThe blood product used most commonly for ET is citrated fresh whole\nblood.

Refer to Appendix 4 on Protocol on Exchange Transfusion. Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\n9. PHARMACOTHERAPY\nThere is limited good evidence on pharmacotherapy in NNJ. i. Clofibrate\nClofibrate, an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors,\nis a lipid-lowering drug used in patients with hypercholesterolemia. In\nNNJ, its presumed mode of action is by increasing bilirubin conjugation\nand secretion. Clofibrate is efficacious when compared to placebo in unconjugated\nneonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in terms of the need for phototherapy\nand ET, duration of phototherapy and peak TSB levels. No major sideeffects have been reported.74 - 76, level I\nIn Malaysia, clofibrate is not registered with the Drug Control Authority. ii. Immunoglobulin\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been used to reduce the rate of\nhaemolysis in babies with rhesus hemolytic disease and other immune\nhemolytic jaundice. It is a competitive inhibitor for antibodies that\ncauses red cell destruction. In a meta-analysis of 12 studies, the efficacy of IVIg was inconclusive in\nboth Rh and ABO haemolytic diseases of the newborn as only studies\nwith high risk of bias showed benefit. No mortality or adverse reactions\nwere reported.77, level I\niii. Human albumin\nIt has been postulated that intravenous (IV) human albumin infusion\nmay be protective against bilirubin toxicity by providing more binding\nsites, thereby reducing the levels of unbound bilirubin. It has also been\nhypothesised that vascular bilirubin-albumin binding would cause a\nshift of bilirubin from the extravascular to the intravascular compartment\nfollowing albumin administration.", "chunk_order": 18}

In two small studies, babies were administered IV human albumin (20%,\n1 g/kg) one hour prior to ET. In the treated group, the mean TSB levels\nafter ET were significantly lower than the control group. The treated\ngroup required a significantly shorter duration of phototherapy postET.78, level II-1; 79, level I The duration of hospital stay was also significantly\nshorter in the treated group.78, level II-1 However, the unbound bilirubin\nwas not measured in both studies. Human albumin is a pooled blood\nproduct with a risk of blood-borne infection. Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\niv. Tin-mesoporphyrin\nIn a Cochrane systematic review, there was no evidence that\nhyperbilirubinaemia can be effectively prevented or treated with\ntin-mesoporphyrin, a drug that inhibits bilirubin production through\nblockage of heme oxygenase.80, level I\nv. Phenobarbitone\nIn a meta-analysis of three RCTs of moderate quality, phenobarbitone\nwas efficacious in reducing peak serum bilirubin, duration and need\nof phototherapy and need of ET in preterm babies with very low birth\nweight. Further studies are warranted to evaluate adverse effects and\nneurodevelopmental outcome.81, level I\n\u2022 Further studies are required before clofibrate or its equivalent can be\nrecommended for use in NNJ. \u2022 There is no conclusive evidence to support the use of IVIG, human\nalbumin and phenobarbitone in the management of NNJ.

Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\n12. IMPACT OF BREASTFEEDING\nBreast milk provides the best nutrition for babies and its benefits\nextend beyond basic nutrition. World Health Organization recommends\nexclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age. There is evidence\nthat breastfeeding is associated with an increased incidence and\nseverity of early NNJ. This may be due to inadequate intake as a result\nof poor lactation support but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Further details on this issue are available in ABM Clinical Protocol #\n22: Guidelines for Management of Jaundice in the Breastfeeding Infant\nEqual to or Greater Than 35 Weeks\u2019 Gestation.84, level III\nIn the USA Kernicterus Registry (1992 - 2004), lactation failure was\nidentified in over 90% of babies discharged on exclusive breastfeeding,\nwith a high incidence of excessive weight loss and dehydration.39, level III. Breastfeeding is significantly associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia,\n1, level II-2; 36, level III; 85, level III; 86, level II-3 greater body weight loss,36, level III;\n85, level III; 86, level II-3 higher peak bilirubin level, and longer mean days\nof phototherapy and hospitalisation.86, level II-3 It is also associated\nwith reduced urine and stool output on the second and third day of\nlife.85, level III; 86, level II-3\nIn exclusively breastfed babies, those with lower gestational age\nand greater weight loss percentage are significantly associated with\nhyperbilirubinaemia.37, level III\nRecommendation 10\n\u2022 Breastfeeding, because of its benefits, should be continued in the\njaundiced babies. \u2022 Adequate lactation/breastfeeding support should be provided to all\nmothers, particularly those with preterm babies. \u2022 In breastfed babies with jaundice associated with inadequate\nintake, excessive weight loss or dehydration, supplementation with\nexpressed breast milk or formula may be considered. Management of Neonatal Jaundice (Second Edition)\n13. PREVENTION OF SEVERE NNJ\nLate preterm, G6PD deficiency and isoimmune haemolytic disease\n(ABO and Rhesus incompatibility) are well known factors for developing\nsevere NNJ. Phototherapy thresholds are lower for babies with these\nfactors (refer to Chapter on Phototherapy). Predischarge bilirubin\nscreening, clinical risk factor scoring, prophylactic phototherapy and\npharmacotherapy are among the strategies studied to prevent severe\nNNJ. Predischarge screening involves performing daily TcB screening until\ndischarge; this TcB value is referenced against the AAP hour-specific\nbilirubin risk-zone nomogram stratified into low-, intermediate- and\nhigh-risk zones (refer to Figure 2).

Parents and carers13, level III\nAdvice that should be given to parents/carers during antenatal and\npostnatal visits include:\n1. Look for jaundice daily during the first week of life. 2. Check the naked baby for jaundice in bright and preferably\nnatural light, by blanching the skin with gentle finger pressure\nover the chest. 3. Presence of jaundice needs to be confirmed by healthcare\nproviders; blood tests may be required. 4. Jaundice in the first 48 hours of life needs urgent review by\nhealthcare providers. 5. Continue breastfeeding even if the baby is jaundiced. Contact a\nhealthcare provider for assistance with breastfeeding if needed. 6. Untreated jaundice may lead to deafness and brain damage. 7. Phototherapy is a safe and effective form of treatment for\nneonatal jaundice. 8. Traditional and alternative methods of treating jaundice are\nunproven and likely to be ineffective. 9. Exposing the baby to sunlight as a form of treatment may be\nharmful due to dehydration and sunburn. B. Healthcare providers\nHealthcare providers should take note on the following in NNJ\nmanagement:\n1. Antenatal education should include NNJ. 2. Routine postnatal visits should include the detection of NNJ. 3. Effectiveness of breastfeeding should be assessed during postnatal\nvisits. Individualised lactation support and help should be given to\nbreastfeeding mothers.
