It is based on the best\navailable evidence at the time of development. Adherence to this\nguideline does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in\nindividual patient care. Thus, every health care provider is responsible\nfor the management of his/her unique patient, based on the clinical\npresentation and management options available locally.

In Malaysia, we have now published Guidelines\non treatment of various aspects of heart disease, including\nhypertension and myocardial infarction. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now an established\nmethod of treating atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The\nadvent of modern stents, delivery systems and allied technologies\nhas allowed interventional cardiologists in the country to improve\ntheir means of delivering a PCI service. The wealth of evidence on PCI, both local and international, has led\nto an expert panel of interventional cardiologists being convened\nto draw up these Guidelines. Clinical evidence, technical \u2018tips and\ntricks\u2019 and information on other aspects of cardiovascular disease\nmanagement, make these Guidelines useful for cardiologists and\nnon-cardiologists alike. While PCI is still a popular option for many Malaysian patients with\ndocumented obstructive coronary artery disease, it is not the only\noption. Aggressive pharmacotherapy and coronary artery bypass\nsurgery are two other important avenues of treatment. Hence, these\nGuidelines serve to aid clinicians to help patients make informed\nconsent about their treatment. I congratulate the panel and the National Heart Association of\nMalaysia on these Guidelines, which I believe will be an important\nresource for all concerned. Y. Bhg Tan Sri Datuk Dr Hj Mohd Ismail Merican\nDirector General of Health Malaysia\nClinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n3\nFOREWORD FROM THE PRESIDENT,\nAMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY\nThe American College of Cardiology supports the use of Clinical\nPractice Guidelines to help improve the quality of care for all patients\nwith cardiovascular disease. We believe these are particularly\nimportant steps in efforts to achieve better patient outcomes in those\npatients with serious disease.

Process:\nEvidence was obtained by systematic review of current medical\nliterature on PCI for CAD using the usual search engines \u2013 PubMed,\nMedscape and Ovid. The other international guidelines (American and\nEuropean) on PCI were also studied. After much discussion, the draft\nwas then drawn up by the members of the Expert Panel and submitted\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines,\nMinistry of Health Malaysia and key health personnel in the major\nhospitals of the Ministry Of Health and the Private Sector for review\nand feedback. The clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and\nmembers of the Expert Panel were assigned individual topics. The\ngroup members met several times throughout the development of the\nguideline. All retrieved literature were appraised by individual members\nand subsequently presented for discussion during group meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively\nby members of the Expert Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient\nthe recommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. The\ndraft was then sent to local external reviewers for comments. It was\nalso sent to members of the American College of Cardiology and the\nEuropean Society of Cardiology for feedback.

INTRODUCTION\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of morbidity and\nmortality in Malaysia1. It accounted for about a fifth of the total burden\nof disease (admissions in government hospitals) in 2000. Coronary\nartery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease accounted for 50%\nand 32% of the cardiovascular burden respectively1. In 2006, CVD was\nthe commonest cause of deaths in government hospitals accounting\nfor 24.2% of total deaths2. Management of CAD includes aggressive risk factor modification and\nlifestyle changes, medical therapy and revascularisation procedures. Revascularisation is by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and\ncoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In Malaysia, there has been an increase in the number of diagnostic\nand interventional cardiac procedures performed over the last few\nyears. With technical improvement in devices and skills, more complex\nPCI cases are now being addressed. The National Cardiovascular Disease (NCVD) - PCI Registry was\ninitiated in 2006 to obtain data and for clinical audit. The objectives of this clinical practice guideline are to critically evaluate\nthe use of PCI in the management of CAD based on currently available\nliterature. It aims to:\n\u2022\nassist health care providers in clinical decision making regarding\nthe appropriate use of coronary revascularisation procedures\n\u2022\nimprove patient outcomes following PCI\n\u2022\nimprove the standard of care in patients undergoing PCI\nFor this purpose, this guideline is divided into 2 parts:\n\u2022\nPart A: The role of PCI in the management of patients with CAD\n\u2022\nPart B: Technical aspects of PCI as a revascularisation strategy\nGuidelines help in the management of patients. Not all eligible\npatients will have access to all the recommendations stated in\nthis guideline. Patient care should be individualised and clinical\njudgement plays an important role in decision making.

ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)\nDefinition:\nMyocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis due to acute total\nocclusion of the coronary artery. The culprit vessel should be reopened as early as possible to\nprevent cell death and for myocardial salvage. Reperfusion may\nbe achieved by either primary PCI or fibrinolytic therapy. Primary\nPCI is defined as intervention in the culprit vessel without prior\nthrombolytic therapy. (see Flow Chart 1, page 23)\nWhen compared to fibrinolysis, patients with STEMI treated by\nprimary PCI have consistently been shown to have3:\n\u2022 lower short term mortality\n\u2022 fewer non fatal reinfarctions\n\u2022 fewer intracranial hemorrhages and strokes\nHigh risk patients have the greatest mortality benefit with\nprimary PCI. The short term benefits persisted during long term\n(6-18months) follow\u2013up4,5.", "chunk_order": 6}

The short term benefits persisted during long term\n(6-18months) follow\u2013up4,5. Timing is one of several factors that should be considered when\ndetermining the appropriate reperfusion strategy. In patients\nundergoing primary PCI, the optimal door to balloon time should\nbe within 90 minutes. However, with every 15 minute delay in\nthe time between arrival at the door and restoration of TIMI 3\nflow, mortality increases6. The mortality benefits of primary PCI is seen when the\nincremental delay to PCI (door to balloon time minus door to\nneedle time) is no more than 60 minutes of the patient\u2019s arrival\nat the hospital7. A more recent study suggests that even if the\nincremental delay is up to 2 hours, primary PCI has mortality\nbenefits beyond fibrinolytic therapy8. \u201cTIME IS MYOCARDIUM\u201d\nMost of the trials comparing primary PCI to fibrinolytic therapy\nhave been carried out by experienced operators with skilled\nsupport staff.

Recent studies show that routine angiography and PCI with stent\nimplantation (as opposed to routine balloon PCI only) in the early\nhours after fibrinolysis improved patient outcomes as compared to\nsymptom or ischaemia guided delayed intervention16-19,21,27-32. This strategy of immediate or early angiography with the intent to\nperform PCI with stenting as necessary, within hours of fibrinolysis\n(< 24 hours), has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality\nand reinfarction rates without an increase in adverse events. The\noptimal timing interval between fibrinolytic therapy and PCI is\nhowever still unknown. 2.1.3. 4. Delayed selective angiography and PCI\nThis strategy refers to patients undergoing angiography and PCI\nonly if there is spontaneous or inducible ischaemia. Stable patients who are at low risk and who did not undergo early\n(< 24 hours) angiography should undergo stress testing33,34. If\nspontaneous or inducible ischaemia is present, then angiography\nand appropriate revascularisation should be performed. Routine PCI of totally occluded coronary arteries 3-28 days\nafter STEMI is not recommended unless there is ischaemia\ndemonstrated35. However if the patient is admitted to a non PCI center and is stable\npost fibrinolysis, an initial conservative approach with delayed\nselective angiography and PCI may be adopted guided by the\nattending physician\u2019s discretion.

In these cases, the treatment of choice is primary PCI. Cardiogenic shock may occur after STEMI or Non ST Elevation\nMI (NSTEMI) and carries a very high mortality rate. It may be\npresent at admission or may develop during hospitalisation\n(in-hospital onset). In Europe, the rate of cardiogenic shock at\nadmission has remained the same but the rate of in-hospital\nonset has decreased. This was due to increased rates of primary\nPCI51. Cardiogenic shock is usually due to left ventricular pump failure\nalthough occasionally it may be due to right ventricular infarction\nor mechanical complications such as acute valvular insufficiency\nand ventricular septal rupture. Mechanical complications should be\nconsidered for early surgical repair although surgical risks are high. Emergency PCI or urgent CABG is the treatment of choice and\nshould be considered early. Patients who are less than 75 years\nof age should be considered for PCI13,52 whatever the time delay;\nthe earlier the intervention the better the outcome.

An IABP should be used early (preferably even\nbefore starting the procedure) to help maintain perfusion and to\naugment LV performance.

The role of IABP in the management of patients\nin cardiogenic is currently being addressed in an ongoing trial60. Patients in cardiogenic shock often have multivessel disease\nand all critical lesions besides the culprit lesion, should be\ndilated taking into consideration the amount of contrast used\nand the length of the procedure. This is in contrast to the usual\nrecommendation to only treat the culprit vessel in primary PCI\nfor STEMI without cardiogenic shock. If multivessel PCI is not\npossible, then the patient should be evaluated for urgent CABG. The use of stents and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors has been associated\nwith improved outcomes36.

The survival of patients post MI\nwho were on all 4 medications (aspirin, \u03b2-blockers, statins and\nACE-I) was greater than those on zero, one, two or three of these\nmedications only77,78. Nitrates, calcium channel blockers and other anti ischaemic agents\n(such as trimetazidine and ivabradine) may also be added for\nrelief of angina and for reducing myocardial ischaemia. Reduction\nin ischaemia was associated with a significant reduction in risk\nand better long term outcomes79. It is important to achieve risk factor treatment goals (Appendix VII,\npage 80). Patients who attained these treatment goals generally\ndid better78,80. These medications should be continued long term\nprovided that there are no contraindications. 2.3.1.1. Indications for revascularisation\nThe following individuals should be considered for revascularisation:\n\u2022 patients with significant and/or disabling angina especially\nwithin 3 months of a recent MI81\n\u2022 patients with large areas of ischaemia on non invasive testing\n\u2022 those whose symptoms were initially well controlled but with\nrecurrence of symptoms or objective evidence of worsening\nischaemia on non invasive testing74\nIn general, all stable asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic\npatients should undergo testing for reversible ischaemia prior to\ncoronary angiography. If this was not done, certain coronary angiographic features may\nhelp decide the need for revascularisation81:\n\u2022 Subtotal occlusions supplying non infarcted myocardium\n\u2022 Stenosis greater than 90%\n\u2022 Significant complex lesions that are prone to develop total\nocclusions\n\u2022 Reduced fractional flow reserve (< 0.8)82,83\n\u2022 Minimal Luminal Area (MLA) <4.0 mm2 in proximal 2/3 of epicardial\nvessels as assessed by intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS)84\n2.3.2.

To obtain the same long term clinical benefits as\nseen in patients undergoing CABG, it is important that patients\nundergoing PCI have complete revascularisation87. In general,\nrepeat revascularisation procedures are less with CABG. With the\nuse of stents, however, the need for repeat procedures following\nPCI has also been reduced by as much as 50%88. Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n30\nCABG has been shown to have a survival benefit in high risk\nindividuals with complex coronary anatomy (e.g. left main stem,\ntriple vessel disease) 89,90. These patients were often not included\nin the randomised clinical trials done in the pre-stent era. In the early trials done in the pre \u2013 DES era, CABG has been\nshown to have a lower 5 year risk of death in patients with:\n\u2022 diabetes85,88,91 (see section on Diabetes)\n\u2022 multi-vessel disease with impaired Left Ventricular (LV) systolic\nfunction (LVEF < 35%)\nPatients with impaired LV function were not randomised in most\nof the trials. These patients are traditionally better treated with\nCABG although treatment needs to be individualised. When compared to medical therapy, patients with significant\nleft main stem narrowing (> 50%) do better with CABG. Most of\nthe early trials of PCI for left main stem disease have used bare\nmetal stents. Procedural success was high but there was high\nearly restenosis and mortality92,93. More recent trials using DES\nhave had more promising results91. When left main stem disease\nis associated with poor LV function, CABG is the preferred\nrevascularisation strategy (see section on Left main stem disease). A recent large trial comparing PCI (with DES) and CABG for\npatients with triple vessel CAD and left main stem disease\nshowed that both procedures were equally effective in reducing\ndeath and MI91. Patients undergoing PCI however, had more\nrepeat revascularisation procedures. Generally patients with\nmore complex disease (higher \u201cSYNTAX\u201d scores94) did better\nwith CABG. There was a lower incidence of strokes in patients\nundergoing PCI85,91. Ideally, the best strategy for revascularisation in a patient with\nCAD should be made by mutual discussion by a \u201cheart team\u201d\nconsisting of cardiologists and surgeons taking into consideration\nthe coronary anatomy, the presence of co-morbidity and the\npatient\u2019s preferences89.

Non-cardiac surgery in the post PCI patient\nPatients with significant cardiac disease (unstable CAD, significant\narrhythmias, decompensated HF and severe valvular stenosis) should\nbe properly evaluated and treated prior to non cardiac surgery99. In patients with CAD, routine prophylactic coronary angiography\nand PCI is not recommended in stable patients undergoing noncardiac surgery100. Patients with UA/NSTEMI, recent MI and Class III and IV\nangina (Appendix VI, page 80) should undergo appropriate\nrevascularisation prior to elective surgery. Where PCI is the chosen\nrevascularisation strategy, POBA or if stents are necessary, BMS\nshould be used instead of DES. Patients post PCI with DES requiring elective or emergency\nsurgeries pose significant challenges. These patients are exposed\nto the risks of either:\n\u2022 possible life threatening surgical bleeding due to the\ncontinuation of their anti platelet therapy\n\u2022 acute MI and cardiac death due to stent thrombosis resulting\nfrom the premature or inappropriate discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. The situation is aggravated by surgery itself which creates a\nprothrombotic and pro\u2013inflammatory state. These risks must be\ncarefully balanced against the risk of delaying the operation to\nsuch time as is considered safe to stop antiplatelet therapy101,102. Antiplatelet therapy should not be stopped casually. The peri-operative physicians, anaesthesiologists and surgeons\nshould contact the patient\u2019s cardiologist prior to surgery to discuss\noptimal patient management. Patients should also be advised\nto inform any healthcare provider who instructs them to stop\nantiplatelet therapy to consult their cardiologist first. Low risk surgical procedures where bleeding is minimal or can\nbe easily controlled such as routine dental procedures or simple\nsurgical operations such as removal of skin cysts/ lumps should\nnot justify cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy. Wherever possible, elective surgery should be deferred for at least\n4-6 weeks after BMS implantation and at least for a year after DES\nimplantation. If surgery cannot be delayed, clopidogrel should be stopped for a\nminimum of 5 days and preferably for 7 days prior to surgery and\nrestarted as soon as possible after the procedure.

ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR PCI\n3.1. Antiplatelet agents\n3.1.1. Oral Antiplatelet Therapy\n3.1.1.1. Aspirin\n\u2022 Patients on long term aspirin therapy undergoing elective PCI\nshould continue taking their usual dose before the PCI procedure. \u2022 Patients not on aspirin therapy should be given 300mg of\naspirin at least 2 hours and preferably 24 hours before the PCI\nprocedure. Enteric coated aspirin should not be given because\nof the slow onset of action. \u2022 After the PCI procedure, patients should be on life long aspirin\ntherapy106. \u2022 The daily long term aspirin dose should be 100-150mg\nindefinitely106. \u2022 The optimal loading dose and maintenance dose of aspirin\nfollowing PCI is being addressed in an ongoing study\n(CURRENT/OASIS-7). 3.1.1.2. Thienopyridines\na) Clopidogrel\n\u2022 A loading dose of clopidogrel 300-600mg should be administered\nbefore PCI107-111. This loading dose is important in patients\nadmitted with STEMI and ACS111,112. \u2022 However, in patients with chronic stable angina undergoing PCI,\na recent study found no benefit in pretreating with clopidogrel. It\nwas found that giving clopidogrel in the catheterisation lab just\nprior to ad-hoc PCI did not result in an increase in ischaemic\ncomplications113,114. \u2022 In patients who have undergone PCI, clopidogrel 75mg daily\nshould be given for at least 1 month after bare-metal stent\nimplantation (unless the patient is at increased risk of bleeding;\nthen it should be given for a minimum of 2 weeks)115. \u2022 After DES, clopidogrel should be given at 75mg daily for at least\na year116,117. \u2022 In patients with an absolute contraindication to aspirin, it is\nreasonable to give a 300-600mg loading dose of clopidogrel,\nadministered at least 6 hours before PCI. This is followed by a\nmaintenance dose of 75-150 mg daily. \u2022 The dose of clopidogrel may be increased to 150 mg per day if\nplatelet aggregration studies show that there is less than 50%\ninhibition of platelet aggregation118. \u2022 Patients who are at high risk of very late stent thrombosis (eg. multiple overlapping stents, long stents, small vessels, ostial\nor bifurcation lesions, LMS, sub-optimal stent result), may be\nconsidered for long term dual antiplatelet therapy (beyond a\nyear)102. b) Ticlopidine\n\u2022 It may be considered as an alternative to clopidogrel following\nPOBA or BMS implantation.

Only patients who\nsubsequently went on to CABG had increased bleeding with\nprasugrel126. 3.1.2. Intravenous Antiplatelet Therapy \u2013 Glycoprotein (GP)\nIIb/IIIa Inhibitors\n\u2022 If clopidogrel is given at the time of an ad-hoc procedure,\nsupplementation with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors can be beneficial\nto facilitate earlier platelet inhibition than with clopidogrel\nalone127,128. \u2022 In STEMI, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be given in the presence of\nintra-coronary thrombus. \u2022 In a recent small study, tirofiban administered in the pre-hospital\nsetting prior to primary PCI, was found to be associated with\nsignificant ST segment resolution129. \u2022 In patients with high risk ACS, it may be administered as\nan upstream therapy or in the catheterisation laboratory (inlab)130,131. \u2022 A recent study showed that patients with NSTEMI treated with\naspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin, there was no benefit to the\nupstream use of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, eptifibatide compared\nwith provisional use immediately prior to PCI. Routine upstream\nuse of eptifibatide increased major bleeding as well as the need\nfor transfusion132. \u2022 In low to intermediate risk elective PCI patients, GP IIb/IIIa\ninhibitors do not confer additional benefits in those who are\nalready pre-loaded with 600mg clopidogrel133.

Antithrombotic Therapy\nThese include:\n- Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)\n- Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)\n- Bivalirudin\n- Fondaparinux\n\u2022 Unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be administered to\npatients undergoing PCI. \u2022 Bivalirudin may be used as a substitute for heparin in patients\nwith heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)135. \u2022 It is reasonable to use bivalirudin as an alternative to UFH\nand GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients undergoing elective\nPCI127,136,137,138. \u2022 In patients with STEMI, the use of bivalirudin instead of UFH\nwas associated with lower major bleeding and all cause\nmortality but with a small increase in stent thrombosis137. \u2022 Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is a reasonable\nalternative to UFH in patients with UA/NSTEMI undergoing\nPCI139. A dose of enoxaparin at 0.75 mg per kilogram given\nintravenously (IV) yields bleeding rates similar to those for\nunfractionated heparin, with more predictable anticoagulation\nlevels140. \u2022 Fondaparinux is best used in UA/NSTEMI and STEMI patients\ntreated conservatively. \u2022 Fondaparinux is associated with an increase in catheter-related\nthrombus and coronary angiographic complications. It is not\nrecommended as the sole anticoagulant during PCI141,142. \u2022 If fondaparinux is used in UA/NSTEMI and the patient requires\nan invasive strategy, UFH should be given during the procedure. When used in PCI, it is associated with lower bleeding rates\nthan LMWH141,142,143. \u2022 No benefit was seen with the use of fondaparinux in Primary\nPCI142. For dosages refer table 5, page 36.

SPECIAL CLINICAL CONDITIONS\n4.1. Diabetes\nDiabetics have higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality\nfollowing both CABG and PCI. Early studies showed that\nCABG [with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior\ndescending artery] was associated with a better long term survival\nthan POBA152,153,154. This was due to:\n\u2022 accelerated\natherosclerosis. New\nlesions\n(plaque\nprogression) were more frequent among diabetics. This\noccurred more commonly in arteries that were dilated during\nthe initial procedure155. Accelerated disease progression has\nalso been seen after surgical revascularisation. \u2022 restenosis: restenosis rates were higher in diabetics and\nthese frequently presented as occlusive restenosis156,157. The\nlong term survival of these patients was worse than those\ndiabetics without restenosis or those who presented with\nnon-occlusive restenosis158. Diabetics especially insulin dependent diabetics with poor\nglycemic control (HbA1c > 7%) were more likely to have restenosis\nand adverse outcomes following PCI159. They also have worse\noutcomes following primary PCI for STEMI, the higher the blood\nglucose levels, the worse the prognosis160. The prognosis of diabetic patients following PCI has improved\nwith the use of:\n\u2022 GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors: In a meta-analysis, the use of abciximab,\nresulted in 1 year mortality rates in diabetic patients being the\nsame as placebo-treated non-diabetics134. \u2022 stents: Stents, especially DES, has resulted in significant\nreduction in restenosis rates in diabetics although it still\nremains higher than in non-diabetics88,91,161-164. PCI in diabetic patients:\n\u2022 is appropriate in \u201cless severe\u201d disease165,166 i.e. 1 or 2 vessel\ndisease with discrete lesions in combination with stents and\nGP IIb/IIIa inhibitors167,168,169. \u2022 with multi vessel disease \u2013 The optimal method of\nrevascularisation is still being addressed in ongoing trials\n(e.g. BARI 2, FREEDOM). More recent trials comparing PCI\nwith DES to CABG found that the 3 year combined rates of\ndeath, MI and stroke were similar for diabetics treated by\nstenting or by surgery. The diabetics however had a higher\nrate of repeat revascularisation91,170,171,172. Lesion characteristics, vessel size and clinical judgement can help\nguide the choice of revascularisation strategy.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n4.2.1. Prognosis\nIn patients with CKD:\n\u2022 PCI was associated with a higher in-hospital and long term\nmortality compared to patients without CKD; the higher the serum\ncreatinine, the worse the outcome173,174. Even patients with a serum\ncreatinine of 1.1 and 1.2 mg/100ml (96.8 and 105.6 \u00b5mol/l) had a\nnon-significant trend towards higher mortality175. \u2022 and on renal replacement therapy (dialysis) CABG was associated\nwith a better 2 year survival compared to PCI176. \u2022 the use of stents was associated with significantly better\nsurvival175,177. There is insufficient data at present on the best means of revascularisation\nin patients with less advanced stages of CKD. In patients with ACS, the presence of CKD is an additional high-risk\nfeature associated with increased mortality, the more severe the CKD,\nthe higher the mortality. A recent meta-analysis showed that patients\npresenting as UA/NSTEMI and treated with an early invasive strategy\nhad better outcomes178. All patients with CAD should be screened for kidney disease by estimating\ntheir glomerular filtration rate (GFR), looking for microalbuminuria and\nmeasuring the urine albumin: creatinine ratio. Estimated GFR can be\ncalculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula (Appendix VIII, page 81). Patients with CKD are at increased risk of:\n\u2022 Acute Renal Failure Post Intervention\n\u2022 Bleeding\n4.2.2. Acute Renal Failure Post Intervention\nAcute renal failure (ARF) following PCI is defined as 0.5mg/100ml (44.2\n\u00b5mol/l) rise in serum creatinine levels from baseline or a relative increase\nof \u226525% from baseline, 2 to 7 days following contrast administration179. Diabetic patients with baseline serum creatinine values <2.0 mg/100ml\n(<176 \u00b5mol/l) are at higher risk than non-diabetic patients, whereas all\npatients with a serum creatinine >2.0 mg/100ml (>176 \u00b5mol/l) and poor\nLV function are at high risk for ARF180,181. Acute renal failure following PCI, is an independent predictor of 30 day\nand long term mortality and morbidity180,181. Possible causes of ARF include contrast nephropathy and cholesterol\nembolisation. Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n39\n4.2.2.1.

A recent trial\nshowed that low osmolar contrast medium was as safe as isoosmolar agents184,185.

The renoprotective effect of sodium\nbicarbonate is hypothesized as being due to urinary alkalinization\nmaking it less amenable to the formation of free radicals. 4.2.2.2. Cholesterol Embolisation\nAcute renal failure may occur due to microembolisation of cholesterol\nparticles into the renal vessels. It is often associated with cholesterol\nembolisation to other visceral organs and the peripheral vessels. It is\nassociated with a high mortality. 4.2.3. Bleeding Risks\nPatients with CKD have increased bleeding risks. This is partly due to\nplatelet dysfunction and also because many cardiac drugs especially\nsome anti thrombotic agents are excreted by the kidneys. In patients\nwith CKD, their doses need to be adjusted to avoid excessive bleeding\n(Table 8, page 41). Bivalirudin and fondaparinux seem to be associated\nwith less bleeding than heparin or enoxaparin138,190.

After adjusting\nfor age and risk factors, however there were no gender differences in\nsurvival rates. Women tend to have smaller coronary arteries and thus higher\nrestenosis rates after POBA194. Coronary dissection and acute coronary\nocclusion are also more common in women. These complications are\neffectively managed with the use of stents. In fact, it has been suggested\nthat stenting may be the primary reason for the improvement in cardiac\noutcomes with PCI in women195. 4.3.1. Technical considerations\nWomen\u2019s smaller blood vessels predispose them to more vascular\naccess site complications. They also tend to have more bleeding complications with the use of antithrombotic agents and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. 4.4. Elderly\nThe elderly tend to have a higher rate of complications following both\nPCI196,197 and CABG198. This includes death, MI, strokes, renal failure\nand vascular complications196. This is partly due to their more extensive\nClinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n42\ndisease with calcified vessels. They also tend to have lower left\nventricular function and more co-morbidity. With the use of stents, procedural success is higher than with POBA and\nrestenosis rates are comparable to that of younger patients197,199,200. Elderly patients presenting with ACS have better outcomes with\nPCI69,199,200. However the bleeding and vascular complication rates are\nhigher. Clinical decision should take into consideration the biological age rather\nthan the chronological age. 4.4.1. Technical considerations\nIn view of their often calcified vessels, rotablation may sometimes be\nnecessary prior to stent deployment. Anti-thrombotic agents, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors and X-ray contrast agents\nmust be used judiciously. 4.5. History of bleeding diasthesis, bleeding gastrointestinal or\nprevious hemorrhagic stroke\nIn these patients the choice of revascularisation strategy should be\ncarefully balanced against the risks associated with bleeding. If PCI is\nthe chosen strategy, POBA or using BMS should be considered.

It can\nincrease in size by up to 0.25 to 0.5 mm at higher pressures. Its\nrated burst pressure is lower, typically between 12 to 16 Atm. \u2022 Non-compliant balloon \u2013 this balloon minimally increases in size\nand its rated burst pressure can be as high as between 24 to 26\nAtm. It is usually used to post dilate a stent for optimal results and\nto \u201ccrack\u201d open hard lesions e.g. calcified or fibrotic lesions. The\nballoon profile is poor after initial dilatation and deflation. As such it\nmay not be reusable. 5.1.1. Cutting Balloons\nThis device has 3 to 4 very fine blades within the folds of the balloon. When the balloon is expanded, the blades will cut into the tissue and\nproduce controlled dissections. This in turn leads to less inflammatory\nClinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n44\nresponse and reduced neo-intimal proliferation.

Focus force (Safe cut) Balloons\nThis balloon is used in the same way as a cutting balloon. It utilizes the\nvery same guidewire in the artery to cut into the tissue. It may not cut as\neffectively as a cutting balloon but it has a lower crossing profile. 5.1.3. Drug-eluting Balloons\nThis balloon is coated with an anti-proliferative drug with a special coating\nto retain the drug whilst the balloon is being delivered to the target site. At present only the balloons coated with paclitaxel are available. Since\nthe drug is coated onto a balloon it gives a more homogenous drug\ndelivery to the tissue as compared to a DES whereby the drug is located\nonly on the stent struts. It has been shown to be better than POBA and the Taxus DES in the\ntreatment of ISR with lower late loss, target lesion revascularization\n(TLR) and major adverse coronary events at 6 months and better event\nfree survival at 12 months 204,205,206. It may be useful in the treatment of small vessel disease. Studies are\nongoing in the treatment of subsets of high risk patients e.g. in multivessel disease, diabetics and bifurcation lesions. 5.2. Stents\nThis metallic device is used to scaffold the vessel. Its uses include:\n\u2022 treating dissections to prevent abrupt/acute closure\n\u2022 preventing restenosis following suboptimal results after balloon\ndilatation \u2013 residual stenosis of > 30% following POBA. \u2022 preventing restenosis in high risk lesions (e.g. chronic total occlusion,\nleft main stem lesions and saphenous vein graft lesions)\nStenting reduces recurrence of ischaemic symptoms and re-intervention\nbut do not affect mortality outcomes36-40,207,208.

Bare Metal Stents (BMS)\nCurrently available coronary stents are made of either stainless steel\n316L or cobalt chromium. The latter has thinner struts thus resulting in\nlower risk of restenosis. It is more flexible and conformable whilst at the\nsame time having similar radial strength as the stainless steel stents. However it is less radio-opaque. Coronary stents come in different sizes ranging from 2.25 to 5.0 mm in\ndiameter and from 8 to 38 mm in length. Larger and longer stents are\nless deliverable. When dealing with a tortuous vessel, it is better to use\na shorter stent. Another consideration in the choice of a stent will be its side branch\naccess. Good side branch access allows easier passage of devices\nthrough the stent struts.", "chunk_order": 26}

Good side branch access allows easier passage of devices\nthrough the stent struts. Most stents can be delivered through a 5F guiding catheter (except for\nthe larger stents which are >3.5 mm in diameter). Generally, for the\nsimultaneous deployment of 2 stents, the minimum size of the guiding\ncatheter should be 7F. 5.2.2. Drug Eluting Stents (DES)\nThe Achilles heel of angioplasty and stenting has been restenosis as a\nresult of neointimal proliferation. If substantial, it can lead to significant\nin-stent restenosis (ISR). The rates of restenosis with BMS can be as\nhigh as 50% in certain situations e.g. CTO, long lesions, small vessels,\ndiabetics, ostial and bifurcation lesions. In large vessels (>3.5 mm) with\ndiscrete lesions the restenosis rates with BMS is low. Stents may be coated with antiproliferative agents to inhibit neointimal\nproliferation and therefore reduce the risk of restenosis. They act on\nspecific sites in the cell growth cycle. The current agents used are the\nlimus group e.g. sirolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus and biolimus and the\ntaxol group i.e. paclitaxel. The clinical studies were mainly conducted in uncomplicated (i.e. type\nA and B lesions). In the real world setting however, it is mainly used in\ncomplex lesions with a higher tendency for restenosis. There are several concerns with DES:\n\u2022 Cost consideration \u2013 DES generally cost more than BMS. \u2022 Stent Thrombosis \u2013 section 6.8.1 (page. 55)\nIn making a choice between a BMS and DES, it is important to take into\nconsideration the patient\u2019s risk for stent thrombosis, ISR and bleeding. If\nthe patient is unlikely to comply with long term dual antiplatelet therapy,\nis at increased risk of bleeding or may need a non-cardiac operation in\nthe near future, one should consider alternative strategies such as using\nBMS, endothelial progenitor cell capture stents or refer for CABG. 5.2.3. Endothelial Progenitor Cell Capture Stents\nThis stent is coated with antibody that captures circulating endothelial\nprogenitor cells. These cells rapidly transform into endothelial cells. This\nleads to rapid healing with a functional endothelium. With this stent,\nClinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n46\ndual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for only a month followed by\nlong term aspirin therapy. A recent study however, showed that it was inferior to BMS in patients\nwith STEMI due to a high incidence of adverse events, late lumen loss\nand stent thrombosis at 6 months209. 5.2.4.

Covered stents\nThese are useful for sealing coronary perforations and excluding\naneurysms. They have a higher profile and are less trackable. They are\nalso associated with higher rates of stent thrombosis and restenosis. These patients require long term dual anti platelet therapy. 5.2.5. Biodegradable (Bioabsorbable) polymers and stents\n5.2.5.1. Biodegradable Polymer\nOne of the concerns with polymer based stents is the risk of inflammation\nthat may predispose to stent thrombosis. Biodegradable polymer\nreduces this risk. A study has shown that they are as efficacious as\nother first generation DES but they have not been shown to be any safer\nat 1 year210. 5.2.5.2. Biodegradable DES\nThe potential advantage of this type of stent is the avoidance of\nstent thrombosis. It also offers the possibility of allowing that stented\nsegment to be grafted during CABG after it has degraded. Typically an\nideal biodegradable DES will be degraded over 18 to 24 months after\novercoming the problem of elastic recoil and neointimal proliferation. These stents are currently being evaluated in ongoing trials. 5.3. Rotational Atherectomy (Rotablator)\nThis device rotates at very high speeds (target usually between\n140,000 to 200,000 rotations per minute) to selectively break down\nthe atheromatous plaque into very small particles which is then\nwashed downstream. There is a steep learning curve in utilizing this\ntechnology. Its use is now mainly limited to:\n\u2022 debulking calcified lesions that may impede delivery of devices and\ngood stent deployment\n\u2022 pre-treating uncrossable and undilatable lesions prior to stenting\nAdjunctive devices like a temporary pacemaker is required to avoid\nbradyarrhythmias particularly when dealing with right coronary artery\nand dominant left circumflex lesions. Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n47\n5.4. Directional Atherectomy\nThis device is able to cut though atheromatous plaque and the\n\u201cshavings\u201d are then brought out from the catheter. It is used mainly for\nbulky lesions especially for LMS and ostial lesions. However directional\natherectomy is rather cumbersome to use and the advent of DES has\nlimited its usage. 5.5. Microcatheters\nThese catheters are mainly used in the treatment of CTO lesions. It\nlends support for the wire in crossing the CTO and also facilitates wire\nexchange. 5.6. Thromboaspiration catheters\nThese devices are useful in the treatment of thrombus-laden lesions\nespecially during primary PCI. These catheters are effective in removing\nthe thrombus and improving TIMI flow and myocardial perfusion (TMP\nflow) post-procedure.

Thrombectomy Devices\nThese devices are used in decimating thrombus during primary PCI\nfor the same purpose as thromboaspiration catheters. Mechanical\nthrombectomy appeared to increase mortality during primary PCI43. 5.8. Protection Devices\nThese devices help to protect the distal vessels to reduce distal\nembolization. Situations in which these devices are useful are in the\ntreatment of thrombus laden vessels (especially in primary PCI) and in\ndegenerated SVG intervention211,212. Protection devices may be placed either distal or proximal to the lesion. Distal protection devices come in the form of balloon occlusive devices\nand filter devices. Proximal protection devices are useful for distal SVG\nlesions that do not have an adequate landing zone. However this device\ncannot be used for ostial SVG lesions. When used during Primary PCI, these distal protection devices had a\nneutral effect on mortality43. 5.9. Laser Therapy\nBesides being used in primary PCI to lyse thrombus, the laser device\ncan be used in CTO lesions to create a channel to facilitate balloon\npassage before subsequent balloon dilatation and stent deployment. Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n48\n5.10. Coil Embolisation\nCoils are used to seal off persistent perforations created by wire\nmanipulation and for closure of arterio-venous (AV) fistulae. These are\ndelivered through a large lumen microcatheter. 5.11. Intravascular Imaging Devices\n5.11.1. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)\nIVUS is the most common imaging device introduced on the guidewire. Its uses are:\n\u2022 assessing the severity of borderline lesions\n\u2022 assessing the degree of calcification\n\u2022 assessing vessel size especially in small vessels, LMS\n\u2022 aiding stent size selection and assessing results post-stent\ndeployment eg stent apposition and deployment, edge dissections,\ncoverage of ostial lesions, stent malapposition\n\u2022 guiding wire crossing in CTO lesions\n5.11.2. Optical Coherence Tomography\nThis device gives a more detailed imaging of the vessel wall as compared\nto images obtained from IVUS. It gives a clearer image of red and white\nthrombus, plaque rupture, plaque protrusion through stent struts and\nstent malapposition. However the depth of image tissue penetration is\nlower than those obtained from IVUS. 5.11.3. Virtual Histology\nThis imaging modality uses the same IVUS catheter but a special software\nprogram allows lesion characterization to be made. Atherosclerotic\nlesions can be divided into fibrous, fatty, necrotic, calcified and fibrocalcified components. Presently it is used mainly as a research tool for\nidentifying vulnerable plaques. 5.11.4. Angioscopy\nThis is mainly an investigative tool.", "chunk_order": 29}

However in order to visualise the vessel a balloon\nneeds to be dilated proximally to obstruct flow during the whole duration\nof imaging. Thus care needs to be given to prevent the occurrence of\nventricular fibrillation. 5.12. Others\n5.12.1. Pressure Wire\nPressure wire is useful in the assessment of borderline lesions. The wire\nhas a small transducer at the tip of a 0.014 inch wire which can be used\nas a regular guidewire. Following bolus intracoronary adenosine injections, the pressure\ndifference between the aorta and distal to the lesion is measured. A\nvalue of < 0.8 indicates a significant lesion82,83.

Left Main Stem (LMS) Disease\nThe conventional treatment for unprotected LMS (>50%) is\nCABG. PCI of unprotected LMS is feasible and promising but\nthe early studies have showed high morbidity and mortality\nrates91,92,213-218. With the use of DES, the results have improved and the incidence\nof adverse events has decreased. In a recent trial comparing the\nuse of DES and CABG, both treatment strategies had similar\nrates of death and MI at 1 year91. When undertaking PCI for unprotected LMS disease the following\nare important considerations:\n\u2022 anatomical location of the lesion \u2013 the results of PCI with\nDES for ostial and body lesions are better as compared to\ndistal lesions involving the bifurcation\n\u2022 LV function \u2013 in the presence of depressed LV function,\nCABG is the preferred strategy\n\u2022 associated multi vessel disease \u2013 CABG is a better option\n(Table 3, page 14 for recommendations and grading)\n6.1.1. Technical considerations\nPCI of the unprotected LMS should be done by skillful operators\nin high volume centers with surgical back-up. PCI should be performed preferably with DES216,217,218. If a DES\nis used for a vessel that is >4.0 mm then it should be upsized\nappropriately. The stent must be well deployed and apposed. An IVUS is highly recommended to ensure optimal stent\ndeployment. If the LV function is depressed and when dealing with high risk\nunprotected LMS lesions, IABP support is recommended. Close surveillance either by coronary or CT angiogram is\nrecommended at about 3 to 9 months after the procedure. Long term dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended. 6.2.", "chunk_order": 30}

Close surveillance either by coronary or CT angiogram is\nrecommended at about 3 to 9 months after the procedure. Long term dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended. 6.2. Multi-vessel disease\nAn important factor determining treatment strategies in a patient\nwith multi-vessel disease is the clinical status of the patient i.e. elective versus an urgent procedure. 6.2.1.

UA/NSTEMI\nIn the setting of ACS, it is recommended to treat the culprit lesion and\nstage the procedure. However in certain situations where the patient\nis stable and the anticipated procedure is uncomplicated, complete\nrevascularisation may be attempted at the same sitting36. 6.2.3. STEMI\nIn STEMI, where the patient is noted to require CABG as a definitive\nprocedure, PCI of the infarct related vessel may serve as a bridge to\nstabilise the patient. Wherever possible, use of a BMS is advocated in\nthis setting to avoid the risk of peri-operative (CABG) stent thrombosis.

It is also associated with a higher\ncomplication rate (e.g. coronary perforation and cardiac tamponade). Hence it requires experienced, skillful operators performing in high\nvolume centers with cardiothoracic surgical back-up. Certain lesion characteristics favor successful recanalisation with PCI. (Appendix X, page 82)\n6.3.1. Technical Considerations\nGenerally an antegrade approach is utilised aided with contra-lateral\ninjections of contrast to delineate the distal segment. Retrograde and\nControl Antegrade and Retrograde Techniques (CART) techniques\nshould be performed only by experienced operators. Challenges in CTO intervention include:\n\u2022 good guide support \u2013 sometimes \u201cmother and child\u201d technique (2\nguiding catheters \u2013 1 bigger and 1 smaller) is utilised for better\nsupport\n\u2022 wires for crossing the lesion \u2013 these include 0.010 inch tip,\nintermediate wire, stiff hydrophilic or polymer coated wire (from the\nMiracle and Conquest series). These special wires are used for\npenetration of CTO lesion with innovative techniques which include\nparallel wire and anchor balloon. \u2022 devices for crossing the lesion \u2013 these include OTW and small\nballoons, microcatheter, Tornus, rotablation\n\u2022 IVUS guidance may be used to help identify the true lumen\nRadiation dose to the operator can be reduced by lower dose (kV)\nsetting, extra shield, pulsed fluoroscopy and extra collimation. Radiation\ndose to the patient can be reduced by lower dose (kV) setting and\navoiding extreme angulations. Indications for stopping the attempted procedure:\n\u2022 Excessive contrast (> 600 ml in non-diabetic with normal renal\nfunction)\n\u2022 Complications (false lumen, excessive staining)\n\u2022 Long procedure\nDES is preferred for CTO222. 6.4.

(Appendix XI, page 83)\nIt is important to make the distinction of whether it is a \u2018true\u2019 bifurcation\nor a \u2018non-true\u2019 bifurcation lesion. 6.4.2. Technical Considerations\nA number of strategies have been described and used to treat bifurcation\ndisease223. These include:\n\u2022 simple strategy \u2013 one that involves a single-stent. \u2022 complex strategies \u2013 involve double (or multiple) stents for bi-/trifurcation lesions\n\u2022 dedicated bifurcation stent \u2013 still in development\nDifferent techniques which are often utilized are:\n\u2022 V stenting\n\u2022 T stenting\n\u2022 Culotte\n\u2022 simultaneous kissing stents\n\u2022 minicrush, reversed crush\nMost bifurcations can be treated with a single-stent strategy in the main\nvessel with a provisional plan for a second stent implantation in the\nside-branch in the event of suboptimal results223,225,226. The definition of\nsuboptimal result varied among the different trials. It will depend upon\nthe size of the side-branch223. The 2-stent strategy tends to be more time-consuming, uses more\ncontrast and is related to more biomarker release. It may look better\nangiographically immediately after the procedure, but, in the long\nterm is associated with greater restenosis, TVR rates and stent\nthrombosis226,227,228. If the 2-stent strategy is utilised, DESs are preferred223. In post stent\ndeployment it is crucial to have kissing balloon inflation especially in\nthe crush and Cullote techniques229,230. There are some studies that\nsuggest that simultaneous kissing balloon inflation after each stent\ndeployment may further improve long term result (Double Kissing-Crush\ntechnique)231. An IVUS is generally recommended when a large area of myocardium\nis at risk e.g. LMS bifurcation disease. Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n53\n6.5. Ostial Lesions\nOstial lesions are usually defined as lesions within 3mm of the takeoff of a major coronary artery. Native aorto-ostial, aorto-graft-ostial and\nbranch-ostial lesions can be distinguished. Treating ostial lesions is technically difficult and is associated with a\nhigher risk of complication and re-stensosis rates. 6.5.1. Technical considerations\n\u2022 Precise placement of the stent is important to ensure that the ostium\nis well covered and to avoid excessive jutting of the stent struts into\nthe main vessel. \u2022 Ideally the ostium needs to be \u2018well prepared\u2019 prior to stent\ndeployment. \u2022 The vessel needs to be dilated appropriately (balloon sized to the\nvessel size) before stent deployment to allow for good stent expansion. This will reduce the risk of re-stenosis. \u2022 Directional atherectomy may be useful to debulk the lesion first. \u2022 DES is preferred.", "chunk_order": 33}

Problems that may occur include:\n\u2022 fall in BP when engaging the vessels \u2013 a smaller size guiding catheter\nor the use of side holes may help alleviate this. \u2022 risk of dissection \u2013 the dissection may spiral down the vessel and\noccasionally it can occur retrogradely into the aortic root. This\ncomplication may be due to guiding catheter manipulation. 6.6. Saphenous Vein Grafts (SVG)\nFollowing CABG:\n\u2022 between one and six years, the annual graft attrition rate is 1% to 2%\nand becomes 4% to 6% per year after that, so that about half of SVGs\nhave significant stenosis or are occluded after 10 years. \u2022 up to 15% of SVGs are closed within 1 year232,233,234 and by 10 years,\nnearly a third of patients require repeat revascularisation235. This could be due to new disease in vessels not previously bypassed,\nprogressive disease in native vessels beyond the graft anastomosis, or\ndisease in the bypass grafts themselves. Treatment options for Saphenous Vein Graft Disease include:\n1. Redo-CABG\n\u2022 Redo-CABG is associated with 2- to 4-fold higher risk than the\ninitial CABG, with periprocedural deaths in 2-5% and myocardial\ninfarctions in 2-8% of patients. Five- and 10-year survival rates are\n84-94% and 75%, respectively236,237. Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n54\n\u2022 Difficulties in redo-CABG include:\n- risk of injuring the other patent grafts especially the\ninternal mammary artery\n- patient subsets who tend to be older and sicker with more\ndiseased target vessels, poorer LV function, availability of\nconduit and serious co-morbid medical problems\n2. PCI\n\u2022 the main limitation of POBA in SVGs is the high restenosis\nrates of up to 23-73% of patients within 6 months and the\nrisk of distal embolisation\n\u2022 DES is a reasonable option but its definite role remains to\nbe defined\n\u2022 PTFE-covered stents may be useful for treatment of graft\nrupture or aneurysm\nSome trials comparing PCI and repeat CABG demonstrated\nless in-hospital death and MI after PTCA, but more complete\nrevascularisation and less target lesion revascularisation (TLR)\nat 4 years after repeat CABG238,239. 6.6.1. Technical considerations during SVG\nPercutaneous Intervention:\nDegenerated SVGs are characterised by friable plaques\nwith overlying thrombus which increases the procedural\nrisks of distal embolisation manifesting as slow or no-reflow\nphenomenon. As such the use of protection devices is strongly\nrecommended211,212, 240.

GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors have not been found to be helpful in SVG\nintervention241,242. Vasodilators eg. adenosine, verapamil, sodium\nnitroprusside may be used for situations of slow-flow or no-reflow. 6.6.2. Arterial conduit \u2013 Internal Mammary Artery (IMA)\nAngioplasty and stenting procedure to the IMA has high success rates\nwith less acute complications of abrupt closure, distal embolisation,\nacute myocardial infarction or need for emergency surgery.

Coronary Artery Aneurysm\nThe optimal treatment of coronary aneurysms remains\ncontroversial. Coronary aneurysm may lead to ischemia and MI. Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice243,244.

If platelet\naggregation studies reveal insufficient (<50%) inhibition of platelet\naggregation with standard dual antiplatelet therapy, a higher dose\nclopidogrel - 150 mg/day- should be considered119. Additional stent implantation should be limited to bail out significant\nresidual dissections. The implantation of a second stent for stent\nthrombosis is associated with a worse 6 month outcome254. PCI for stent thrombosis due to either BMS or DES have similar\npoor outcomes with low rates of reperfusion and high rates of death\nand adverse cardiac events254. This further highlights the importance\nof preventing stent thrombosis and choosing the appropriate\nrevascularisation strategy for the individual patient. In preventing stent thrombosis, it is important to consider253:\n\u2022 Patient factors: Patient compliance and absence of contraindication to\ndual antiplatelet therapy is pivotal during the decision making process\nfor stent selection254. \u2022 Technique: The stent must be well deployed and fully\nexpanded throughout its entire length. This can be done\nusing a short non compliant balloon at high pressure. Care\nshould be taken to avoid dissections. If it occurs, it should be\nClinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n57\ntreated appropriately. It is important to avoid excessive stent length\nand usage of multiple overlapping stent255 since this correlates with\nstent thrombosis. \u2022 Anti platelet therapy: It is crucial that dual antiplatelet therapy not\nbe discontinued prematurely256. It should be continued for at least a\nyear and in some complex cases, long term. 6.8.2. In-stent Restenosis (ISR)\nBalloon angioplasty is associated with up to 40% risk of restenosis207.

Most times this can be\nmanaged conservatively by prolonged compression preferably guided\nby ultrasound. Occasionally, vascular consult may be necessary. Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nmanagement of percutaneous\ncoronary intervention (PCI) 2009\n59\n7.1.3. Arterio-Venous (A-V) Fistula\nThis can be prevented by avoiding a through-and-through puncture of\nthe artery and vein. Most A-V fistula can be treated conservatively. Most of these access site complications are more common with femoral\nrather than with radial punctures. Thus radial punctures are generally\npreferred270,271. However the radial artery is also a good arterial conduit\nduring CABG with good long term results272,273. Thus the choice of\naccess will depend upon the patient characteristics, the operator and\nthe institution. 7.2 Acute Renal Failure Post Intervention\nSection 4.2.2, page 38\n8. LONG TERM FOLLOW UP AND CARE\nThe objectives of follow-up post-PCI patients are:\n\u2022 to look for recurrent symptoms\n\u2022 for secondary prevention\n8.1. Evaluation of Ischemia\nNeither exercise testing nor any form of imaging has been proven to be\nbeneficial for the routine, periodic monitoring of asymptomatic patients\nafter PCI without specific indications. For high risk patients (e.g. diabetes mellitus and suboptimal PCI results)\nstress imaging is preferred to evaluate for ischemia after PCI. 8.2. Secondary Prevention\nIt is important that the patient should adhere to medical therapies\nand secondary prevention programs to prevent progressive disease. (Appendix XIII, page 85)\n9. RADIATION PROTECTION\nThe largest source of radiation comes from medical radiation and the\nlargest users of medical radiation are interventional cardiologists. It is\nimportant to be know the biohazards of radiation. Interventional cardiologists should be aware of radiation protection. This\nentails reducing the radiation exposure to as low a level as reasonably\nachievable to patients, medical staff and themselves.
