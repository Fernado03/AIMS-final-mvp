The guidelines should not override the responsibility of\nthe practitioners to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of\nthe individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and\ntheir families or guardians, taking into account the management options\navailable locally. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2024 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2028) or sooner if new evidence warrants earlier\nrevision. When it is due for updating, the Chairperson of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or\nomissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this\ndocument, which will be the definitive version at all time.

Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nii\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe following recommendations are highlighted by the CPG\nDevelopment Group as the key recommendations that answer the\nmain questions addressed in the CPG and should be prioritised for\nimplementation. Diagnosis\n\u2022 Diagnosis of asthma should be made based on typical clinical\nhistory, physical examination and evidence of airway obstruction\nvariability. Spirometry is the preferred tool to demonstrate airway\nobstruction variability or reversibility. General Principles\n\u2022 The assessment of asthma control should be performed before\nconsidering stepping up or down the treatment. Patient Education\n\u2022 Regular medical reviews in asthma patients are preferred over\nself-adjustment of medications aided by asthma action plan. Stable Asthma\n\u2022 Assessment of asthma should include:\n\uf0a1 evaluating current asthma symptoms control using validated\ntools\n\uf0a1 identifying future exacerbation risk factors and co-morbidities\n\uf0a1 checking adherence, inhaler techniques and other treatment\nrelated issues\n\u2022 In the treatment of asthma:\n\uf0a1 inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonists (SABA) should not be used as\nmonotherapy\n\uf0a1 inhaled SABA may be used as reliever therapy with regular\ninhaled corticosteroids (ICS)\n\u2022 All asthma patients should be on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-\ncontaining therapy. \u2022 Asthma patients who smoke or vape should be strongly encouraged\nto quit at every clinic visit. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\niii\nAsthma Exacerbation\n\u2022 Treatment should be initiated immediately based on severity of\nasthma exacerbation. \u2022 Systemic corticosteroids should be given in all patients with asthma\nexacerbation. \u2022 Following asthma exacerbation, all patients should be given a followup plan upon discharge. Special Groups\nSevere Asthma\n\u2022 Biologics should be considered as add-on treatment for severe\nasthma after optimising therapy. Phenotype assessment should be\nconducted prior to this. \u2022 Long-term oral corticosteroids should be reserved for severe\nasthma when no alternative treatments are available. Pregnancy\n\u2022 Inhaled corticosteroids-containing therapy should be initiated in\npregnant asthma patients and continued if already in use.", "chunk_order": 2}

Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\niv\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this CPG were from\nthe Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Higher Education and private\nhealthcare. There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review\nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database\nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines\nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans,\npublication from year \u201c2017 to Current\u201d and English language. In\naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were\nsearched, and experts in the field contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 17 January 2023 to 5 March 2023. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of\nthe CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published\nbefore 31 July 2024 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search\nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other CPGs on Asthma which included:\n\u2022 Global Initiative for Asthma \u2013 Global Strategy for Asthma\nManagement and Prevention (2024)\n\u2022 Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR)]\n\u2013 GEMA 5.3. Spanish Guideline on the Management of Asthma\n(2023)\n\u2022 British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines\nNetwork \u2013 British Guideline on the Management of Asthma (2019)\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as\nreferences. A total of 21 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 23 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the two groups.", "chunk_order": 3}

These pathophysiological changes lead to episodic symptoms, e.g. shortness of breath, which can range from mild to severe in severity. However, asthma symptoms are often subtle and may be overlooked\nor misdiagnosed as other conditions, contributing to delays in proper\nmanagement. Recognising and addressing this diagnostic challenge is\na key focus of this CPG, which aims to improve asthma care through\nevidence-based recommendations. Asthma continues to pose significant public health challenges, affecting\nmillions globally and thousands in Malaysia. Despite advances in\ndisease understanding and treatment, asthma remains frequently\nmisdiagnosed or poorly managed, resulting in avoidable suffering,\nhospitalisations and even deaths. The inaugural CPG for asthma in adults, introduced in 2017, was a\nlandmark achievement in standardising asthma care. It set a strong\nfoundation for evidence-based practice and improved patient outcomes. Since then, the rapidly evolving landscape of asthma management -\nincluding the advent of biologics for severe asthma e.g. omalizumab,\nbenralizumab and dupilumab - has necessitated a comprehensive\nupdate. With two additional biologics currently in the pipeline, i.e. tezepelumab and mepolizumab, this updated CPG aims to provide\nclinicians with the latest evidence-based resource to deliver the highest\nstandard of care for asthma patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for innovative\nand adaptable healthcare solutions. Recognising this, the MoH is\nactively exploring the development of online inhaler technique tutorials,\nwith plans for their release in the near future. These resources, once\navailable, will complement the appendix of inhalers provided in this\nupdated CPG. Together, they aim to enhance inhaler technique,\nempower patients and improve treatment adherence for better asthma\nmanagement. For those with severe asthma, the availability of cutting-edge biologic\ntherapies has transformed the management paradigm. The CPG\nDevelopment Group takes pride in the locally developed algorithm for\nselecting biologics in severe asthma management. Designed by the\ngroup, this tool is comprehensive and user-friendly, providing a practical\nresource for clinicians. Tailored to the Malaysian context, this CPG acknowledges the\nchallenges of local healthcare system, cultural nuances and prevalent\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nmisconceptions about asthma. It aims to dispel myths, address gaps in\nunderstanding, and provide clear, actionable guidance for healthcare\nproviders and patients. This updated CPG aspires to be more than just a\nreference - it\u2019s a tool to elevate asthma care in Malaysia. By empowering\nhealthcare professionals with the latest knowledge and strategies, the\nburden of asthma can be reduced leading to transformation of the lives\nof those affected.

DIAGNOSIS\nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease with distinct inflammatory patterns. In Type 2 (T2)-high asthma, inflammation is driven by T2 cytokines\n[interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13], leading to eosinophilic inflammation,\nelevated IgE and increased fractionated exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)\nlevels. This phenotype is typically responsive to inhaled corticosteroids\n(ICS) and biologics targeting T2 pathways. In contrast, neutrophilic\nasthma is associated with low or absent T2 inflammation and may\ninvolve IL-17 and other non-T2 cytokines, with neutrophilic inflammation\nand steroid resistance often observed. \u2022 There is no gold standard test in diagnosing asthma. The diagnosis\nis based on a combination of clinical history, physical examination\nfindings and lung function test with evidence of variable and\nreversible airway obstruction. A thorough history taking to identify asthma symptoms is important\nfor accurate diagnosis. Physical examination may appear normal\nparticularly when the patient is not experiencing an asthma exacerbation. Physical examination is important to rule out other conditions with\nsimilar symptoms. Typical clinical signs of asthma include tachypnoea,\nrhonchi, prolonged expiratory phase and decreased breath sounds. Spirometry should be used to diagnose asthma whenever possible. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity\n(FVC) are parameters obtained from spirometry. These parameters are\nused to show evidence of obstructive lung disease and reversibility\n(refer to Table 3).", "chunk_order": 10}

These tests should be performed\nbefore treatment, at 3 \u2013 6 months after treatment and periodically (1\n\u2013 2-yearly) to establish patient\u2019s personal best FEV1 and monitor for\nlung function decline. A low FEV1 indicates underlying untreated airway\ninflammation and is a risk factor for future exacerbation.2\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) can be measured using both peak\nflow meter and spirometry machine. Peak flow meter is used primarily\nfor home monitoring. Whereas, spirometry is performed in a clinical\nsetting under supervision of a healthcare provider. Whenever possible,\nPEFR should be recorded before treatment is initiated. It should be\nmonitored at 1-hour post treatment and at regular intervals until a clear\nresponse has occurred or a plateau is reached.2\nIf a patient has already started on treatment, the response to the\ntreatment (bronchodilator or corticosteroids) may aid in the diagnosis\nbut lack of response may not exclude asthma.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n4.1. Treatment Goals\nThe goals of asthma management encompass both long-term objectives\nand patient-centred considerations.2\n\u2022 The asthma treatment goals include:\n\uf0a1 achieving optimal symptom control\n\uf0a1 minimising risk of future exacerbations\n\uf0a1 reducing treatment side effects\n\uf0a1 preventing persistent airflow limitation\n\uf0a1 lowering asthma-related mortality\nIt is also essential to identify and incorporate patient\u2019s personal goals\nfor asthma management into the care plan. Effective asthma management requires a collaborative partnership\nbetween the patients and their healthcare teams. This partnership\ninvolves agreeing on management goals and following a cyclical\nprocess of ongoing assessment, treatment adjustment and review of\nresponses as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: The Control-based Asthma Management Cycle\n4.2. Initiating and Optimising Asthma Treatment\n\u2022 The assessment of asthma control is mandatory before considering\nstepping up or down the treatment algorithm. \u2022 Assessment of asthma should include:\n\uf0a1 symptom control by using a validated numerical test (e.g. ACT\nscore), GINA or RCP questionnaire\n\uf0a1 future exacerbation risk\n\uf0a1 adherence to current therapy (insufficient use of ICS and overreliance of SABA)\n\uf0a1 inhaler techniques\n\uf0a1 spirometry readings \u2013 FEV1\n\uf0a1 FeNO (if available)\n\uf0a1 other medical co-morbidities e.g. allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal\nreflux disease (GERD) etc. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nBased on the reviewed evidence, the consensus of the CPG DG for the\nmanagement of stable asthma are presented below. Modifiable risk factors, poor adherence and incorrect inhaler techniques\nshould be addressed and rectified prior to changing the current\ntreatment plans. Once the assessment is completed, treatment can\nthen be initiated (refer to Algorithm 1) or adjusted (refer to Algorithm\n2). The choice of inhalers should be based on its availability, patient\u2019s\npreference, inhaler technique and shared decision making. a. Treatment Initiation\nThe initiation of asthma treatment should be guided by the asthma\ncontrol (severity and frequency of symptoms) and lung function.", "chunk_order": 13}

Treatment Initiation\nThe initiation of asthma treatment should be guided by the asthma\ncontrol (severity and frequency of symptoms) and lung function. For patients with well-controlled asthma (ACT score of \u226520 or \u2018NO\u2019 to\nall GINA questionnaire or RCP questionnaire) and normal lung function:\n\u2022 prescribe a regular low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA as a\nreliever\n\u2022 alternatively, as-needed ICS-formoterol or as-needed ICS-SABA\n(either as separate devices or a combined single device) may be\nprescribed\n\u2022 Monotherapy with SABA is not recommended as its excessive use is\nassociated with risk of asthma exacerbation and mortality. \uf0a1 Thus, it is vital to use ICS together with SABA or regimen without\nSABA [ICS-formoterol anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR)]\nFor patients with not well controlled asthma (ACT score of <20 or \u2018YES\u2019\nto \u22651 GINA questionnaire or RCP questionnaire) with symptoms on\nmost days OR night-time awakening of \u22651 night per week OR FEV1\n<80% of predicted or LLN, the followings are recommended. \u2022 Prescribe either low-dose ICS-LABA or low-to-medium-dose ICS\nas maintenance therapy. In patients with concomitant allergic\nrhinitis, low-dose ICS with leukotriene receptor antagonists\n(LTRA) may be used. \u2022 For reliever therapy, SABA or ICS-SABA may be used. If ICSformoterol is used as maintenance, it can also be used as the\nreliever. In those patients with not well controlled asthma (ACT score of <20\nor \u2018YES\u2019 to \u22651 GINA questionnaire or RCP questionnaire) with daily\nsymptoms OR night-time awakening of \u22651 night per week AND FEV1\n<80% of predicted or LLN, the followings are recommended. \u2022 Prescribe medium-to-high-dose ICS-LABA as maintenance\ntherapy. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\n\u2022 Alternatively, medium-dose ICS-LABA with add-on LAMA or LTRA\n(concomitant allergic rhinitis) may also be used as maintenance\ntherapy. \u2022 For reliever therapy, SABA or ICS-SABA may be used. If ICSformoterol is used as maintenance, it can also be used as the\nreliever. Patients on maintenance therapy, as per Algorithm 1 on Initiation of\nAsthma Treatment, should be assessed for control at 3 - 6 months. If\nthey are well controlled, current therapy could be continued or stepped\ndown with regular assessments. If symptoms remain uncontrolled,\nmanagement should be adjusted according to Algorithm 2 on Step Up\nand Step Down Options in Management of Stable Asthma. b.

LTRA may be added to maintenance therapy if the patient has\nconcurrent allergic rhinitis. Refer to Subsection 6.2.1.b (iv) on LTRA\nand 8.5.c on Allergic Rhinitis. Patients with persistent uncontrolled asthma despite on high-dose\nICS-LABA-LAMA triple therapy should be referred to a respiratory\nphysician and discuss within a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) for\nthorough evaluation and optimal treatment including consideration of\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nbiologics use. Other add-on treatments e.g. low-dose azithromycin\nor oral corticosteroids (OCS) may be offered. An MDT for severe\nasthma typically includes chest physician, allergist, respiratory nurse,\npharmacist and sometimes a psychologist or physiotherapist to provide\ncomprehensive care and management. The choice of reliever therapy depends on the patient\u2019s maintenance\ntherapy. For those on ICS-formoterol, the preferred reliever is ICSformoterol (maximum doses of 12 puffs/day) to avoid confusion and\nimprove adherence. For those on ICS-LABA or ICS monotherapy as\nmaintenance, the choice of reliever can be either SABA or ICS-SABA. The treatment should be continued until reassessment at 3 - 6 months.

Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\n5. PATIENT EDUCATION AND SKILLS TRAINING\nThe main goal of education is to provide patients and their family/other\ncarers with suitable information and training on asthma management in\npartnership with their healthcare providers.2 Patient education should\ninclude:\n\u2022 asthma information\n\u2022 guided self-management\n\u2022 skills training on effective inhaler use\n\u2022 adherence improvement\n5.1. Asthma Information\nThe key topics of asthma information are provided in Table 4.

Guided Self-Management\nGuided self-management is the active process by which healthcare\nproviders guide and support patients to develop self-management\ncompetencies. \u2022 It is essential for patients to understand their asthma, actively\nengage in shared decision-making and take charge of managing\ntheir condition. \u2022 The components of guided asthma self-management include:\n\uf0a1 self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEFR\n\uf0a1 AAP\n\uf0a1 regular medical review by healthcare providers\na. Self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF\nSelf-monitoring by either symptoms or PEF with regular medical review\nand an AAP has been shown to reduce both emergency department\n(ED) visits and hospitalisation rates compared with usual care in\nasthma.3\nb. Asthma action plan\nAAP contains action (decision) points which guide patients in making\nshort-term adjustments to their treatment based on their symptoms\nand/or PEFR. Refer to Appendix 5 on Asthma Action Plan. The AAP\nshould be completed and explained to the patient by the attending\nhealthcare provider to ensure patients understand how to manage their\nasthma effectively.", "chunk_order": 16}

Refer to Appendix 5 on Asthma Action Plan. The AAP\nshould be completed and explained to the patient by the attending\nhealthcare provider to ensure patients understand how to manage their\nasthma effectively. Individualised AAP based on PEFR is equivalent to the plan based on\nsymptoms in hospitalisation and ED visit.3\nAn effective AAP may contain two to four action points. In PEFR-based\nplans, personal best PEFR should be used for the action point. The\ntreatment instruction should include reliever therapy, ICS and oral\nOCS.3 The best PEFR is the patient\u2019s known personal best under\nstable conditions i.e. not measured during an exacerbation. In patients\nwithout known personal best, the predicted value may be used. Refer\nto Appendix 4 on Peak Expiratory Flow Nomogram. In an RCT on mild to moderate asthma patients, increasing a patient\u2019s\nICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation compared with maintaining\nstable dose of ICS showed no difference in the following outcomes:4, level I\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\n\u2022 treatment failure (need for systemic corticosteroids)\n\u2022 unscheduled physician visits\n\u2022 unscheduled acute care, ED visit or hospital admission\nHowever, in patients with poorer asthma control, an open label RCT\nfound temporarily increasing ICS dose by four-fold prolonged the time\nto a first severe exacerbation with HR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.92)\ncompared with stable dose group.5, level I\nIncreasing the dose of ICS does not benefit all patients during\nexacerbation. Patients are advised to seek further medical assistance if\nsymptoms persist despite following the AAP. c. Regular medical review by healthcare providers\nOptimisation of asthma control by adjustment of medications may be\nconducted by either self-adjustment with the aid of an AAP or by regular\nmedical review.3 In a local cross-sectional study, 47.7% of patients\nwere overprescribed with SABA, with 9% receiving prescriptions\nwithout appropriate assessment.6, level III Patients who are unable\nto manage their asthma using AAP will benefit from regular medical\nreview.2 Therefore, the CPG DG opines that regular medical reviews\nare preferred in local setting. d. Strategies to implement guided self-management\nBehaviour change techniques (BCTs) are methods used to facilitate the\nadoption of new desirable behaviours or the cessation of undesirable\nones by targeting various psychological, social and environmental\nfactors. BCTs can range from:\n\u2022 providing information and education\n\u2022 using rewards or incentives\n\u2022 goal-setting\n\u2022 social support\n\u2022 cognitive-behavioural strategies\nA network meta-analysis (NMA) found that BCTs were important\nelements to effective self-management.", "chunk_order": 17}

Recommendation 3\n\u2022 Regular medical reviews in asthma patients are preferred over selfadjustment of medications aided by asthma action plan. \u2022 Behavioural change techniques should be considered in selfmanagement strategy of asthma. 5.3. Skills Training on Effective Use of Inhaler Device\nThe three main categories of inhalers are dry powder inhaler (DPI),\npressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and soft-mist inhaler (SMI). They require different inhalation and operating techniques for effective\nuse. Inhaler technique errors are a common challenge faced by patients\nwith asthma. Improper use can lead to inadequate medication\ndelivery, resulting in poor asthma control and an increased risk of\nexacerbations.9, level I; 10, level II-2\nInhaler errors include failing to exhale completely to empty lungs before\ninhalation, not holding breath or holding it for less than 3 seconds, not\ntilting the head slightly back and improperly loading the dose before\nadministering the second dose.9, level I\nA cross-sectional study on asthma patients using pMDI found the\nfollowing errors were associated with uncontrolled asthma:10, level II-2\n\u2022 actuation before inhalation\n\u2022 incorrect preparation of second dose inhalation\n\u2022 exhaling into the inhaler device\n\u2022 not holding the device upright\nIt also found that in patients using DPI, insufficient inspiratory effort was\nsignificantly associated with an increased likelihood of uncontrolled\nasthma and exacerbations.10, level II-2\nThe CPG DG opines that factors contributing to the above errors\ninclude lack of proper training, misunderstanding of inhaler instructions\nand complexity of multiple inhaler devices prescribed. Addressing these\nissues through education and training is essential to improve inhaler\ntechnique, enhance patient outcomes and ensure effective asthma\nmanagement. Refer to Appendix 6 on Inhaler Devices and Techniques. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\na.

Factors to consider when selecting an inhaler for a patient\nA systematic review of nine published algorithms identified five key\nfactors for device selection:11, level I\nAbility to perform the required inspiratory manoeuvre\n\u2022 Patients\u2019 ability to inhale \u2013\n\uf0a1 slowly and deeply for pMDI and SMI\n\uf0a1 forcefully and deeply for DPI\nThis ability depends on cognitive function and inspiratory muscle\nfunction. For patients with difficulty performing these manoeuvres\nand/or having cognitive impairment, a pMDI with a valved holding\nchamber (VHC) is recommended. Ability to handle the device correctly\n\u2022 Assess patients\u2019 ability to perform the steps of using the inhaler\ndevice, which depends on their manual dexterity and hand\nstrength. Sufficient inspiratory flow for DPI\n\u2022 Assess inspiratory flow and effort to estimate the patient\u2019s\nability to generate turbulent energy needed to disaggregate the\npowder into fine particles. For individuals with insufficient or\nsuboptimal inspiratory flow and effort, a pMDI with VHC or SMI is\nrecommended.

This includes using reliever therapy for relief of symptoms\nand maintenance therapy to reduce inflammation. Treatment should be\ntailored to disease severity, patient\u2019s preferences and response. a. Reliever therapy\nReliever therapy is taken as needed for quick relief of asthma symptoms. It includes SABAs, ICS-formoterol and ICS-SABA. i. Short-acting \u03b22-agonists\nThere is limited new evidence on safety and effectiveness of SABA\nmonotherapy. Regular SABA monotherapy is associated with\ndecreased in bronchodilator response and, increased in airway\nhyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. Excessive SABA\nmonotherapy use (\u22653 of 200-dose canisters a year) is associated with\nrisk of asthma exacerbation and mortality.2\nA local study also showed that patients prescribed with \u22653 canisters of\nSABA/year, either as monotherapy or combination, were more likely\nto have severe exacerbations (OR=2.04, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.89) and\nless likely to have controlled asthma (OR=0.42, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.67)\ncompared with those with 1 \u2013 2 canisters of SABA/year.6, level III\nIn chronic asthma, a combination of short-acting muscarinic antagonists\n(SAMA) and SABA does not offer any additional advantage.3\nOral SABA is not recommended due to its higher risk of side effects\ncompared with inhaled SABA.2\nii. Anti-inflammatory reliever\nAnti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) is a reliever inhaler that contains both a\nlow-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a fast-acting bronchodilator.2\nA Cochrane systematic review of four RCTs on mild asthma showed\nthat as needed single combined budesonide-formoterol inhaler\nreduced asthma-related hospital admission or emergency department/\nurgent care visit (OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91) compared with regular\nbudesonide plus as needed SABA (salbutamol or terbutaline) at 52\nweeks. There were NS differences in exacerbations requiring systemic\ncorticosteroids and annual severe exacerbation rate. However, asthma\ncontrol assessed by ACQ-5 favoured regular budesonide plus as needed\nSABA (MD=0.12, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.15) although it did not reach minimal\nclinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5 points.", "chunk_order": 24}

The percentage of\npatients with any AEs was similar between the groups.25, level I\niii. Long-acting \u03b22-agonists\nThe inhaled rapid-onset LABA i.e. formoterol is as effective as SABA\nas a reliever medication in asthma, but its use without ICS is strongly\ndiscouraged because of the risk of fatal and non-fatal adverse events.3\nThis is supported by a recommendation in SIGN-BTS guidelines where\nLABA should only be started in patients who are already on ICS and the\nICS should be continued.26\nRecommendation 5\n\u2022 In the treatment of asthma:\n\uf0a1 inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonists (SABA) should not be used as\nmonotherapy\n\uf0a1 inhaled SABA may be used as reliever therapy with regular\ninhaled corticosteroids (ICS)\n\uf0a1 inhaled SABA overuse (\u22653 canisters/year) should be avoided\n\uf0a1 oral SABA should not be used\n\uf0a1 anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy (either ICS with formoterol\nor ICS with SABA) may be used as a reliever therapy\n\uf0a1 inhaled long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABA) without ICS should not be\nused as reliever monotherapy\nb. Maintenance therapy\nMaintenance is defined as medication targeting both domains of\nasthma symptom control and prevention of future exacerbation risk. It\nis intended to be used on a regular basis, even when asthma symptoms\nare absent. i. Inhaled corticosteroids\nRegular daily low-dose ICS is indicated for asthma patients on as\nneeded ICS and SABA who either are unable to adhere to treatment or\nremain symptomatic. It significantly reduces asthma symptoms, risk of asthma-related\nexacerbations, hospitalisation and death. However, patients with mild\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nasthma often have poor adherence to ICS, resulting in them relying on\nSABA alone and thus increasing risk of exacerbations.2\nICS dosage can be categorised into low-, medium- or high-dose as\nshown in Table 7.

Combination of ICS and long-acting \u03b22-agonists\nRegular daily ICS-LABA is indicated for asthma patients on regular daily\nlow-dose ICS or as-needed ICS/formoterol who remain symptomatic\ndespite good adherence and inhaler technique. Combination of ICS-LABA is more effective in reducing risk of\nexacerbations compared with a higher dose of ICS alone in asthma\nwith sub-optimal control on low-dose ICS monotherapy.3\nProactive regular dosing (PRD) is a treatment strategy where\nmedication is taken at scheduled consistent interval. It also referred\nto as regular maintenance dosing. A local retrospective study on\npatients with uncontrolled asthma despite using either as-needed\nbudesonide-formoterol or ICS and SABA PRN, PRD of fluticasone/\nsalmeterol was shown as an effective and safe treatment approach. It significantly improved symptom control (mean ACT scores), and\nreduced hospitalisations and systemic corticosteroids use.27, level III\nA recent Cochrane systematic review found no evidence on safety\nconcerns that would affect the choice between salmeterol/ICS and\nformoterol/ICS combination inhalers used for regular maintenance\ntherapy.

Long-term macrolides should be part of a comprehensive asthma\nmanagement plan tailored to individual patient needs. It should only be\nstarted after consultation with a specialist. viii. Oral corticosteroids\nThe use of OCS at the minimum necessary dose and for the shortest\ntime possible may be considered as a last resort for patients with severe\nasthma. Refer to Subchapter 8.1 on Severe Asthma. The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand position paper\nrecommends practicing OCS stewardship in asthma to minimise the\nuse of OCS and mitigate the harm associated with its use.40, level III\nix. Sublingual immunotherapy\nSublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) involves administering allergen\nextracts, typically in tablet or liquid drops to desensitise and decrease\nsensitivity to specific allergen trigger in patients with allergy. The\nduration varies depending on the specific allergens targeted e.g. house\ndust mite (HDM) or grass pollen. A systematic review of RCTs in well-managed mild-to-moderate\nallergic asthma patients showed that SLIT tablets targeting HDM were\neffective in reducing ICS dosage (MD=81 mg, 95% CI 27 to 136) while\nmaintaining adequate asthma control.41, level I The primary papers used\nwere of mixed quality based on ROB assessment. In cases of allergic asthma, allergen immunotherapy is advised when\nthere is clinical evidence of IgE-mediated sensitisation to common\nairborne allergens. It is recommended that allergen immunotherapy be\nadministered by experienced specialists.33\nThe role of SLIT as therapeutic options for asthma is not yet clearly\nestablished in most guidelines.

Refer to Appendix 9 on Common Medications in Asthma. 6.2.2. Non-pharmacological treatment\nNon-pharmacological treatments for asthma include a range of\ninterventions that complement pharmacological approaches. These\nmethods focus on reducing symptoms and improving QoL through\nstrategies e.g. smoking cessation, allergen avoidance, dietary\nmodification, exercise and vitamin D supplementation. a. Smoking cessation\nSmokers have higher risk of adult-onset asthma compared with nonsmokers.3 Smoking in asthma affects airway inflammation, reduces\nresponse to corticosteroid therapy and is associated with poor\ndisease control, decline in lung function, and increased healthcare\nutilisation.2; 42, level III\nAsthma patients who smoke or vape should be strongly encouraged to\nquit at every clinic visit. They should be provided access to counselling\nand smoking cessation programmes. They should also be advised to\navoid environmental smoke exposure.2 For smoking cessation, refer\nto the Malaysian CPG on Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder (Second\nEdition). b. Vitamin D\nVitamin D has been suggested to improve asthma control in patients\nwith vitamin D deficiency.2; 43, level I; 44, level , However, a Cochrane review\nfound that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce the\nrisk of asthma exacerbations or improve overall asthma control in mild\nto moderate asthma.45, level I Most of the primary papers used had low\nrisk of bias. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nc. Physical activity\nPhysical activities improve cardiopulmonary effectiveness by improving\noxygen consumption, maximum heart rate and work capacity. There\nis limited evidence that they cause significant airway narrowing and\nworsening of asthma symptoms. Therefore, they should be promoted\nas part of the general approach to improving lifestyle and rehabilitation\nin people with asthma.26\nPatients\nwith\nexercise-induced\nbronchoconstriction\n(EIB)\nmay\nexperience symptoms if their condition is not well-controlled. However,\nwith proper treatment, they can exercise without triggering asthma\nsymptoms and thus avoiding physical activity is not necessary. There is no specific type of exercise recommended exclusively for\nindividuals with asthma.2 A cohort study in middle-aged adults showed\nthat lighter physical activity 3-times per week reduced current asthma\n(asthma attacks, need for asthma medicine or wheezing in the past\n12 months) by 56% (OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89) compared with\nvigorous physical activity.", "chunk_order": 30}

It\nshould be incorporated into the overall strategy for lifestyle improvement\nand rehabilitation, with careful consideration of the potential for EIB.2; 26\nd. Breathing exercise\nBreathing exercise programmes, which may involve techniques taught\nby physiotherapists in person as well as through audiovisual resources,\ncan be offered as a complementary approach to medication. It can\nreduce respiratory rate, decrease breathing volume, promote the use\nof abdominal and lateral chest muscles, encourage nasal breathing and\nfacilitate relaxation.47, level III These programmes aim to reduce asthma\nsymptoms and improve QoL.26\nA multicentre RCT showed that breathing exercise added to usual care\nwas better than usual care alone in improving QoL in asthma patients\nat six months as measured by mini-AQLQ (MD=0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to\n0.62). This effect was maintained at 12 months (MD=0.38, 95% CI 0.12\nto 0.65).

Dietary modifications\nThe GINA guidelines advocate the consumption of a diet high in fruits\nand vegetables as it can significantly reduce risk of lung function\ndecline which lead to improved asthma control and reduce risk of\nexacerbations.2\nIncreased dietary sodium has been linked to geographical differences\nin asthma mortality with high sodium intake being associated with\nincreased bronchial hyper-responsiveness.

However, there is insufficient evidence to\nsupport the recommendation of fish oil supplementation for asthma\ntreatment.26\nh. Weight reduction\nWeight loss interventions, including dietary and exercise programmes,\nshould be recommended for overweight and obese adults with asthma\nto enhance asthma control.26 Refer to Subchapter 8.5 (a) on Obesity. i. Allergen exposure\nSpecific recommendations for managing allergic asthma should be\nmade after confirming sensitisations to various allergens in a patient.2\nImplementing a combination of specific measures of multifaceted\nallergen avoidance to decrease allergen exposure results in improved\nclinical outcomes.33; 26 Examples of effective strategies involve avoiding\nexposure to these allergens e.g. avoidance of outdoor activities when\nair quality is poor/air pollution, removing pets from the home for\nthose allergic to animal dander and addressing dampness for mold at\nhome.2; 33; 26\nj.

Treatment\ni. Oxygen therapy\nPatients with asthma exacerbation are often hypoxaemic and may\nrequire oxygen therapy. Oxygen saturation of \u226594% should be\nmaintained in all hypoxic asthma patients.3\nAn RCT on severe asthma exacerbation complicated by respiratory\nfailure showed that high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) led to significantly\nhigher pO2 and, lower heart rate and respiratory rate at 24 and 48\nhours after admission compared with conventional oxygen therapy\n(COT). However, overall clinical response was NS between the two\ngroups.53, level I\nAnother RCT on severe asthma exacerbation with hypoxaemia in the\nED setting found that HFNC gave higher comfort scale (MD=3, 95%\nCI 2 to 4) and reduction in dyspnoea (MD=4.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.8) than\nCOT.54, level I\nNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) involves the delivery of oxygen into the\nlungs via positive pressure without the need for endotracheal intubation. In a retrospective cohort study on patients admitted to ICU with asthma\nexacerbation, NIV reduced the risk of intubation (OR=0.36, 95% CI\n0.32 to 0.40) and in-hospital mortality (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.58)\ncompared with no NIV.55, level II-2\nA cohort study of adults with asthma exacerbation-related hospitalisation\nfound that history of 1 - 2 asthmatic exacerbation in the past 12\nmonths was a strong independent predictor for requirement of invasive\nmechanical ventilation with OR of 3.12 (95% CI 1.19 to 8.21).56, level II-2\n\u2022 Patients who are having life-threatening asthma exacerbations with\nsigns of respiratory distress, worsening hypoxaemia, hypercapnia,\naltered mental status, or failure to respond to maximal medical\ntherapy should be considered for early intubation and referral to\ncritical care.

Monitoring\nincludes:\n\uf0a1 Vital signs - Monitor continuously or at least every 15 \u2013 30 minutes,\nincluding SpO2, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure. \uf0a1 Mental status - Monitor for any signs of lethargy, restlessness or\nother changes indicating hypoxia or hypercapnia, or confusion. \uf0a1 Auscultation - Regularly check for changes in breath sounds,\nrhonchi or silent chest. \uf0a1 ABG - Monitor hypercapnia or hypoxaemia. A rising or normal\nPaCO2 may indicate impending respiratory arrest. The specific frequency of monitoring might vary based on the severity\nof the exacerbation, response to treatment, and institutional protocols. Patients with severe exacerbations often require close, continuous\nobservation until they stabilize.

Additionally, it is important\nto discuss strategies to improve asthma management, including\nmedications adherence, proper inhaler techniques and an asthma\naction plan.2 The follow-up plan should include a referral letter to a clinic\nfor the patient to be seen within seven days. Recommendation 14\n\u2022 All patients with severe, life-threatening asthma should be admitted. \u2022 Early referral to critical care team should be considered for patients\nwith asthma exacerbation who respond poorly to optimal treatment. \u2022 Patients with asthma may be discharged with asthma action plan if\nthey:\n\uf0a1 have resolution of symptoms after treatment and\n\uf0a1 are able to follow their prescribed treatment at home\n\u2022 Following asthma exacerbation, all patients should be given a followup plan upon discharge. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\n8. SPECIAL GROUPS\n8.1. Severe Asthma\nSevere asthma affects about 5 - 10% of asthma patients. These patients\nexperience poor QoL, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased\nhealthcare utilisation. Up to 40% of these patients rely on maintenance\nor frequent use of systemic corticosteroids which leads to serious AEs. Asthma is heterogeneous, with various clinical phenotypes driven by\ncomplex biologic endotypes including type-2 (T2) high, T2 low and\nmixed endotypes. Patients with severe asthma should be evaluated by\nthe respiratory physicians, discussed in MDTs and be considered for\nbiologic therapy to improve outcomes. In managing severe asthma, it is crucial to understand the definition of\ndifficult-to-treat and severe asthma as follows:\nClassification\nCriteria\nIncludes one or both of the following:\n\u2022 poor symptom control in the past four weeks (\u22653\nof the following)\n- daytime asthma symptoms more than twice/\nweek\n- reliever use more than twice/week\n- activity limitation due to asthma\n- night waking due to asthma\n\u2022 frequent exacerbations*\n- \u22652/year requiring OCS and/or\n- serious\nexacerbations\n(\u22651/year)\nrequiring\nhospitalisation\nUncontrolled\nasthma\nDefined by any of the following:\n\u2022 uncontrolled\nasthma\ndespite\nmedium-\nor\nhigh-dose ICS with a second maintenance\n(usually LABA) or maintenance OCS\n\u2022 requires high-dose treatment to maintain good\nsymptom control and reduce exacerbation risk\nThe condition may be influenced by modifiable\nfactors:\n\u2022 incorrect inhaler technique\n\u2022 poor adherence\n\u2022 smoking\n\u2022 co-morbidities\nIt may be due to an incorrect diagnosis or asthma\nmimickers e.g.", "chunk_order": 39}

T2 inflammation is present in 95% of patients with severe asthma and\ncan be readily identified using biomarkers. It reflects the underlying\npathobiology of asthma, which is directly involved in the causal\npathway of asthma exacerbations. It also represents actionable targets\nfor anti-inflammatory therapy, including ICS, OCS and biologics. An RCT demonstrated that the use of composite biomarkers of T2\ninflammation is important and may support biomarker-adjusted steroid\nreduction.62, level I\nb. Treatment\ni. Systemic corticosteroids\nLong-term treatment with OCS has been recognised as adjunct therapy\nin uncontrolled asthma. Systemic corticosteroids are considered the\nlast therapeutic option and should be used at the lowest effective dose\nand for the shortest duration possible.2; 33\nExposure to both long-term and repeated acute courses of systemic\ncorticosteroids (>4 courses of OCS in a lifetime) is associated with a high\nrisk of serious AEs e.g. osteoporosis, fracture, pneumonia, heart failure,\ncardio-/cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression/\nanxiety, cataract, renal impairment and weight gain, especially when\nprescribed onto a background of other corticosteroids.63, level III; 64, level II-2\nii.

FeNO-guided treatment demonstrated significantly better ACQ score\nand reduction in exacerbation rate compared with non-FeNO guided\ntreatment.73, level I; 74, level I However, in a recent larger RCT found that\nFeNO-guided treatment in pregnant woman did not show any significant\ndifference in perinatal outcomes or exacerbations compared with nonFeNO guided treatment.75, level I\nDuring pregnancy, patients with asthma should be monitored every 4\nto 6 weeks.2; 3\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nc. Treatment\nTreatment of asthma during pregnancy provides more benefits than the\npotential risks associated with commonly used asthma medications.2\nThe treatment of asthma in pregnancy is the same as in non-pregnant\npatients as listed below.2; 26; 3\n\u2022 ICS is safe and remains the preferred long-term maintenance and\nshould be continued. \u2022 Inhaled \u03b22-agonists and LTRA are safe and should be continued. \u2022 Step-down treatment should be deferred until after delivery. \u2022 Biologics for asthma should be considered only when benefits\noutweigh risks after consultation with a specialist. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to asthma exacerbation\nespecially during the second trimester.

Occupational Asthma\nOccupational asthma (OA) is a form of work-related asthma caused by\nspecific workplace exposures and triggered by immunologic or nonimmunologic airborne stimuli present in the workplace.76 Workplace\nexposures account for an estimated 5 \u2013 20% of new cases of adult\nonset asthma.2 Patients with pre-existing asthma or new adult-onset\nasthma whose symptoms worsen due to non-specific factors in the\nworkplace are considered to have work-aggravated asthma and not\nOA.76\na. Risk factors\nOver 400 causes of OA have been described. Individual susceptibility\nand level of workplace allergen exposure are key risk factors for\ndeveloping OA.76\nIn a systematic review, a cross-sectional study showed that\ninhalable particulate dust was a risk factor for occupational asthma. A cohort study identified atopy to be a predictive risk of occupational\nasthma.77, level III\nCommon occupational groups and workplace agents identified to be at\nrisk for OA are shown in Table 10.76\nTable 10: Frequently Reported Causes of Occupational Asthma\nOccupational Groups\n- Animal handlers\n- Bakers\n- Carpenters\n- Chemical workers\n- Cleaners\n- Dental workers\n- Electrical/electronic\nproduction workers\n- Farm workers\n- Food processors\n- Forestry workers\n- Hairdressers\n- Laboratory\ntechnicians\n- Metal workers\n- Painters\n- Plastics/rubber\nworkers\n- Storage workers\n- Textile workers\n- Waiters\n- Welders\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nWorkplace Agents\n- Animal\u2019s and\ninsects\u2019 protein\n(animal dander,\nurine, saliva,\nserum proteins)\n- Chemicals and\nsolvents\n(aldehydes, acids\nand alkalis)\n- Colophony and\nfluxes\n- Drugs (antibiotics,\nothers)\n- Dyes (used in\ntextile)\n- Henna and\npersulphates\n- Isocyanates\n- Metals (e.g. chromium,\ncobalt, nickel,\nzinc)\n- Plant protein\n(flour and grain\ndust, latex)\n- Wood dust\n\u2022 Patients with OA exhibit typical asthma symptoms and are often\nemployed in high-risk occupations.

They experience a significant\nimprovement in symptoms when away from work or on vacation. b. Diagnosis and assessment\nThe diagnosis of OA is based on recognising characteristic symptoms\nand ruling out other possible explanations. A detailed occupational\nhistory should cover the nature of the patient\u2019s work, possible exposure\nto irritants, patterns of symptoms in relation to work and presence of\nimprovement in symptoms on days off work. \u2022 All working-age adults with new or worsening asthma symptoms,\nreappearance of childhood asthma or unexplained airflow obstruction\nshould be asked about their occupation. PEFR is an important tool in diagnosing and monitoring OA. An\nobjective diagnosis of OA should be made using serial peak-flow\nmeasurements.76\n\u2022 PEFR should be done as per Appendix 3. \u2022 Minimum of four readings should be recorded per day, preferably\nbefore taking bronchodilator. \u2022 The readings should be done two hours apart during waking\nhours. \u2022 The duration of recording should be at least three weeks which\nideally includes three series of workdays with three periods away\nfrom work. \u2022 Work times, task exposures and medication should be recorded\nwith timing specified. A variability of \u226520% on workdays compared to off days is suggestive\nof work-related asthma.3 Refer to Appendix 11 on example of\nmeasurement. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nOther diagnostic modalities for OA include specific IgE assays, skin\nprick tests for causative factors and specific inhalation challenge tests.76\nc. Treatment\nEarly diagnosis and identification of occupational sensitisers, along\nwith worker relocation or hazard substitution, are crucial aspects of OA\nmanagement. Relocating away from exposure as soon as the diagnosis\nis confirmed, ideally within 12 months of experiencing the first workrelated symptoms of asthma is recommended.76\nA Cochrane systematic review on patients with OA showed that:78, level II-1\n\u2022 removal from occupational exposure vs continued exposure\nresulted in \u2013\n\uf0a1 increased likelihood of reporting absence of asthma symptoms\n(RR=4.80, 95% CI 1.67 to 13.86)\n\uf0a1 improved asthma symptoms (RR=2.47, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.84)\n\uf0a1 improvement in FEV1 (MD=4.23, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.31)\n\uf0a1 improvement in non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness\n(SMD=0.43, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.82)\n\u2022 reduced exposure vs continued exposure resulted in \u2013\n\uf0a1 increased likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms\n(RR=2.65, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.68)\n\uf0a1 NS difference in FEV1\n\u2022 Patients with suspected OA should be referred to a specialist for\nfurther evaluation.

Exercise-induced Bronchoconstriction\nExercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is de\ufb01ned as acute airway\nnarrowing (which is transient and reversible) that occurs during or after\nexercise and can be observed in both patients who have and those who\ndo not have chronic asthma.79, level III\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nDiagnosis of EIB in adults relies on typical clinical symptoms and\ndemonstration of reversible airflow limitation, primarily through\nexercise or surrogate challenges.3 Diagnostic test involves measuring\na post-exercise fall in FEV1 of >10% measured 30 minutes after\nexercise cessation.33 The recommended assessment for EIB is a\ndecrease in FEV1 post-challenge through exercise testing or indirect\nbronchoprovocation tests (e.g. mannitol challenge).80\nPatients with well-controlled EIB can exercise safely with proper\nmanagement. They are advised to perform gradual increase intensity\nof warm-up exercises before engaging in sports activities which can\nhelp reduce the severity of bronchoconstriction.33 Patients can use\nSABA (in non-asthmatic EIB) or ICS-SABA or low-dose ICS-formoterol\nfor reliever as needed, prior to exercise, with regular daily ICS regimen\nto help reduce EIB.2 The recommendations on the use of LTRA in EIB\nare not consistent.2; 26\n8.5. Asthma with Co-morbidities\nCo-morbidity is a common problem in patients with asthma and\nassociated with increased risk of AEs to treatment, poorer quality of\nlife and increased healthcare utilisation compared with those without\nco-morbidities. Patients with multiple co-morbidities often have difficultto-treat or severe asthma. Active management of co-morbidities is\nimportant to improve asthma control and asthma-related outcomes. a. Obesity\nObesity is defined as BMI >27.5 kg/m2.81 Patients with asthma who\nare obese tend to have poor asthma control and do not respond well\nto standard asthma treatment. Thus, BMI should be recorded in all\nasthma patients.2\nThe treatment of obese asthma patients is no different from that of other\nasthma patients. ICS remains the mainstay of treatment. However,\nthe response to ICS may be reduced due to activation of alternative\npathways of inflammation (non-type-2 inflammation).2\nWeight loss is important in managing these patients and should be\nadvocated.81 Weight reduction in obese adults with asthma improves\nsymptoms, lung function, morbidity and health status.26 A weight loss of\nat least 5% can lead to an improvement in FEV1.2; 81\nb.

For those who are obese,\ntreatments are similar as outlined in the above section. Continuous\npositive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the recommended treatment\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nfor OSA patients.2; 82 CPAP therapy has been shown to reduce risk of\nasthma exacerbation.2\nc. Allergic rhinitis\nMost patients with asthma have allergic rhinitis while 10 \u2013 40% of\npatients with allergic rhinitis have asthma.3 Rhinitis is defined as irritation\nand inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and can be\neither allergic or non-allergic. Symptoms may vary with environmental\nand/or occupational exposure (e.g. furred pets, house dust mite, molds,\npollens).2 Intranasal corticosteroids is the most effective therapy for\nallergic rhinitis.26 LTRA as an add-on therapy can be beneficial in\npatients with concomitant seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma.3\nd. Chronic rhinosinusitis\nRhinosinusitis is defined as inflammation of the nose and paranasal\nsinuses and, characterised by more than two symptoms including\nnasal blockage/obstruction and/or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior\nnasal drip). Other symptoms may include facial pain/pressure and/or a\nreduction or loss of smell. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined when\nsymptoms occur on most days for at least 12 weeks without complete\nresolution. It can be further classified into CRS with nasal polyps and\nwithout nasal polyps.2\nCRS is associated with more severe asthma, especially in patients with\nnasal polyps. The treatment of CRS should follow the local guidelines.83\nThe presence of nasal polyps may guide the selection of biologic\ntreatment in severe asthma.2\ne. Gastroesophageal reflux disease\nGERD causes symptoms e.g. heartburn, epigastric or chest pain and\ndry cough. Patients with asthma are more likely to experience GERD\ncompared with general population due to relaxation of lower sphincter\ncaused by \u03b22-agonists. Treatment of GERD has no clear effect on\nsymptoms, lung function or airway responsiveness. Proton-pump\ninhibitors has shown benefits in asthma patients with GERD who have\nsymptomatic reflux and nocturnal respiratory symptoms.2\nf. Anxiety and depression\nPsychiatric co-morbidities e.g. anxiety and depression are linked to\npoor asthma control, reduced medication adherence and poor QoL. Patients with these co-morbidities have more frequent exacerbations\nand emergency department visits.2 Referring to psychiatry services is\nimportant to aid proper assessment and effective management of these\npatients.

Therefore, if clinically indicated, nebuliser use should not be\ndiscouraged especially in life-threatening asthma and adherence to\nrecommended safety measures should be emphasised.84, level III\nThe use of pMDI with spacer is an alternative to nebulisers. It should\nbe either single patient use or autoclaved if manufacturer permits.2 If\na commercial spacer is not available or unaffordable, homemade or\ncustom-made spacers e.g. plastic bottles may be used but should not\nbe regarded as equivalent replacements due to their variable sizes,\nshapes and existing electrostatic charge on the devices\u2019 wall.85\nA study evaluating the effectiveness of four accessory devices\n(homemade spacer, Dolphin spacer, DispozABLE paper spacer and\nAeroChamber Plus VHC) in delivering aerosolised drugs from a pMDI\nshowed that homemade and Dolphin spacers had the lowest emitted\ndose fractions with large amounts of salbutamol remaining in these\nspacers (p<0.05) compared with the pMDI alone or the other accessory\ndevices.86, level III\nAsthma in patients with COVID-19 is treated similarly to those without\nCOVID-19.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of asthma should be guided by an evidence-based\napproach, in order to provide quality care to the patients. Several\nfactors may affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 10.1. Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitating factors for application of the recommendations in\nthe CPG include:\n\u2022 wide online dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers\nnationwide\n\u2022 regular respiratory scientific meetings/congress and trainings\nnationally where updates on asthma management are delivered\n\u2022 Malaysian Thoracic Society Adults Severe Asthma Registry Steering\nCommittee that oversees the programme on asthma and severe\nasthma registry\n\u2022 Respiratory Pharmacy Protocol developed by the Clinical Pharmacy\nWorking Committee (Respiratory Subspecialty) of MoH to optimise\npharmacists\u2019 management of asthma in hospitals and clinics\n\u2022 Asthma Malaysia website where reliable and credible information on\nasthma is provided to public\n\u2022 World Asthma Day celebration and educational activities at various\nhospital level across country to raise awareness on asthma and its\nmanagement\n\u2022 Malaysian Thoracic Society Spirometry Certification Workshop,\nInhaler Steering Committee\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:\n\u2022 insufficient knowledge on asthma diagnosis and its management\namong healthcare providers\n\u2022 inadequate accessibility to asthma training at all levels of healthcare\n\u2022 inadequate accessibility to diagnostic tools in asthma e.g. spirometry,\netc. \u2022 inadequate resources to manage asthma e.g. inhalers, biologics,\nsub-specialty clinic, etc. \u2022 lack of proper subspecialty or post-basic training in respiratory\nmedicine including asthma for allied healthcare\n\u2022 lack of awareness, knowledge and understanding on asthma among\npatients and caregivers\n10.2. Potential Resource Implications\nThe recommendations in this CPG require additional resources in terms\nof funds, healthcare infrastructures and human resources/expertise for\ntheir successful implementation as discussed below. Training programmes for healthcare providers are needed to ensure\nthey are equipped with the latest knowledge and skills in asthma\nmanagement. These include ongoing education and certification\nprogrammes to keep healthcare providers updated on best practices\nand emerging treatments. Apart from that, educational resources\nin multiple languages and platforms should be made available and\naccessible to patients, caregivers and public.", "chunk_order": 49}

These will improve\ntreatment adherence and asthma management which will prevent\nfrequent and severe exacerbations. In the diagnosis of asthma, spirometry is essential to confirm\nobstructive lung disease and reversibility. However, this vital tool\nis not readily available especially at primary care. On another note,\ninhalers are the primary method for delivering treatment for asthma. The issues related to the use of inhalers have been emphasised and\naddressed in length in this new edition of CPG. Numerous inhaler types\nare available in market to match different patients need. Unfortunately,\nthese are not always accessible in healthcare facilities as well. These\nare dampened by commonly encounter incorrect inhaler techniques\ndue to confusion and lack of training of the different devices in both\npatients and healthcare providers. It is important to emphasised that\nSABA inhalers are available without a prescription which allow patients\nto purchase them over-the-counter and this may lead to overreliance\non SABA medications. Thus, healthcare providers should be educated\non the harmful effects of SABA monotherapy which should be avoided\nin the clinical practice. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nBiologics for treatment of severe asthma incurs a high cost and may not\nbe accessible to many patients who may require them. This situation\noften leads to the need for long-term OCS and expose patients to risk\nto many AEs. There are also limited accessibility to specialised severe\nasthma clinics with trained personnel to manage these patients.

Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nAppendix 3\nPEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE VARIABILITY\nPeak expiratory flow (PEF) rate variability is an alternative way to\ndiagnose patients with asthma. Firstly, patient need to be educated on the use the PEF meter at home. Preferably the correct technique and reading being done in the clinic\nbefore asking patient to do (record) it at home. Patient is asked to use the same PEF meter (to reduce bias) to record\nhis peak expiratory meter in the morning and evening preferably at the\nsame time of the day. They need to be advised to do PEF reading three\ntimes and record the highest reading in a given table. Diurnal PEF variability is calculated from twice daily readings as below:\nDay\u2019s highest \u2013 Day\u2019s lowest\nx 100\n(Mean of day\u2019s highest and lowest)\nThen the average of each day is calculated over 1 to 2 weeks. Example:\nTotal diurnal PEF Variability = (11.3 + 23.0 + 25.7 + 22.2 + 23.0\n+ 19.6 + 18.5) = 143.3%\nMean Diurnal PEF Variability = 143.3 % \u00f7 7 days\n= 20.47 %\nDiurnal PEF Variability is significant if the reading is >20% in adults\nManagement of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nAppendix 4\nPEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW NOMOGRAM\nMark the patient\u2019s height and age on the respective lines.

Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\n6. *Shaking pMDI well immediately before each actuation is important for delivering the correct dose. While only suspension formulations require shaking,\nto avoid confusion, it is recommended that all pMDI is to be shaken before use. **Varies from product to product. Refer to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. ***VHC are spacers that incorporate a one-way-valve. Tidal breathing can only be performed with VHCs. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nDRY POWDER INHALERS (DPIs)\n\u2022 DPIs are breath-actuated. Patients do not have to coordinate actuation with inhalation. \u2022 Forceful and deep inhalation is needed to create turbulent energy within the device, which de-agglomerates the powder into fine particles. Sufficient inspiratory flow is needed for optimal drug delivery. Management of Asthma In Adults (Second Edition)\nReferences:\n1. Usmani OS.
