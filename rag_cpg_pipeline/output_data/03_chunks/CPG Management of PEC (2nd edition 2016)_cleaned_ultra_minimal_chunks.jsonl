The\nReview Committee was actively involved in the development process of\nthese guidelines. The previous edition of the CPG on the Management of the Palatally Ectopic\nCanine (2004) was used as the basis for the development of these\nguidelines. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. In\naddition to the general text and photographic updates, new and updated\ninformation have been included. In addition, clinical audit indicators have\nalso been identified for the purpose of monitoring referrals. Evidences were updated from publications until June 2016. Literature search\nwas\ncarried\nout\nusing\nthe\nfollowing\nelectronic\ndatabases:\nPUBMED/MEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews; ISI Web of\nKnowledge; Health Technology Assessment and full text journal articles via\nOVID search engine.

Only literatures written in English\nwere retrieved. There were nine clinical questions which were assigned to members of\nthe development group. The group members met a total of eight\ntimes throughout the development of this CPG. All literatures retrieved\nwere appraised by at least two members and presented in the form of\nevidence tables\nand\ndiscussed\nduring\ngroup\nmeetings. All\nstatements and\nManagement of the Palatally Ectopic Canine\n2016\nrecommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the development\ngroup and review committee. These CPGs are based largely on the findings\nof scientific evidence and adapted according to local practices. However,\nwhere there was lack of evidence, recommendations were based on\nconsensus of group members. Although, ideally patients\u2019 views and\npreferences need to be considered in the development of CPGs, in this\ninstance, it was not feasible. Nevertheless, patient information leaflets would\nbe developed to facilitate the dissemination of important information to the\npublic. The levels of evidence of the literature were graded using the modified\nversion from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF),\nwhile the grading of recommendations was based on the modified version of\nthe Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). The draft guidelines were reviewed by a team of external reviewers and were\nalso posted on the Ministry of Health, Malaysia and the Academy of\nMedicine, Malaysia websites for comments and feedbacks. These guidelines\nwere presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, and finally\nto the Health Technology Assessment and Clinical Practice Guidelines\nCouncil MOH Malaysia for approval.

INTRODUCTION\nThe maxillary canine plays a vital role in the functional aspect of the\nocclusion. It has a long root and good bony support and is often referred to\nas the cornerstone of the maxillary arch. Missing or impacted canine will\naffect the function and aesthetic appearance of the smile. An impacted tooth can be defined as the failure of a tooth to erupt within the\nspecified time. An impacted canine is a canine that is prevented from\nerupting into its normal functional position by bone, tooth or fibrous tissue. Palatally ectopic canine (PEC) is defined as the developmental dislocation\nof the upper canine to a palatal site often resulting in tooth impaction\nrequiring surgical and orthodontic treatments.1, level III\nThe erupting maxillary canine should be palpable in the buccal sulcus from\nage of 10 to 11 years.2, level II-3 Eruption of maxillary canines after 12.3 years\nof age in girls and 13.1 years of age in boys may be considered as late.3, level\nIII\nMaxillary canine is the second most commonly impacted tooth after the third\nmolar. The prevalence of impaction of maxillary canines ranges from 0.8%\nto 5.2%.4-5,7-8 level III; 6, level II-3 The crowns of ectopic maxillary canines are more\noften palatally (61%), while 34% are placed in the line of the arch and 4.5%\nare displaced buccally.9, level III Ectopic maxillary canines are twice as common\nin girls. In about 8% to 10% of cases, canine impactions occur bilaterally.10,\nlevel III Currently, there is no published data available on the prevalence of\nimpacted canines in the Malaysian population. This CPG is focused on PEC based on the higher prevalence of its\noccurrence, which requires complex and multidisciplinary management\ncompared to buccally ectopic canine. 1.1 Aetiology\nMaxillary canine has the longest path of eruption into the occlusion and the\nlongest period of development. The aetiology of palatally ectopic maxillary\ncanine remains unclear. However, the following are some of the contributing\nfactors. These contributing factors may be either local or general.", "chunk_order": 5}

Naoumova et al. 32, level I found 69%\nin those aged 10 to 13 years had spontaneous eruption of the PEC, while\nBazargani et al. 33, level I found 67% of PEC normalised. It was noted that the\neffect was significantly more pronounced in the younger patients (10 to 11\nyears) compared to older patients (12 to 14 years). The efficacy of this procedure is supported by Naoumova et al. 34, level I This\nrandomised controlled trial (RCT) found that the greatest predictor on\neruption of the PEC was the timely removal of the deciduous canine. This\ninterceptive procedure may reduce treatment complexity, duration, cost and\npotential complications involved with management of PEC. 3.1.1 Indications\nEricson & Kurol,19, level II-1 listed the following indications:\na) Patients aged between 10 to 13 years. b) Uncrowded arch. c) Ectopic canine root still developing. d) Horizontal overlap of the ectopic canine crown is not beyond the\nmidline of the nearest lateral incisor root. Management of the Palatally Ectopic Canine\n2016\nPower & Short,31, level II-1 reaffirmed the findings regarding the success rate\nbeing affected when the horizontal overlap exceed beyond the midline of\nincisor width. A 91% success rate was reported if the crown of the canine is\ndistal to midline of the lateral incisor and 64% success rate when the crown\nis located mesial to midline of the lateral incisor.19, level II-1 Therefore, early\ndetection is important to ensure greater success rate. 3.1.2 Review\nThis should be done at 6 monthly intervals with follow-up radiographs until\nthe permanent canines erupt.
