Specific attempts were made to use local data and publications to\nensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not necessarily lead to the\nbest clinical outcome in individual patient care. Every health care provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical\npresentation and management options available locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline is issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in about 5 years or earlier if\nimportant new evidence becomes available.

This CPG supersedes the previous CPG. Management of Dyslipidaemia 2017\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nDyslipidaemia remains a significant problem in Malaysia, with the\nNational Health and Morbidity survey in 2015 reporting an estimated\n47% of the adult population having hypercholesterolaemia. In the\nmain, dyslipidaemia is asymptomatic but its associations with serious\nvascular conditions such as acute myocardial infarction and stroke is\nwell known. The previous edition of the National Clinical Practice Guidelines\n(CPGs) were launched in 2011. Since then, the evidence base on this\nsubject has grown and new treatments now available. In addition,\nmore clinical information on dyslipidaemia has emerged from Malaysia and the region. Therefore, this edition, which is the 5th Edition of the CPG on the Management of Dyslipidaemia,\nis timely. Accessing this CPG, and others endorsed by the Ministry of Health, by healthcare providers is\nnow easier, with the advent of modern telecommunications \u2013 downloading a soft copy of this\nCPG should be a seamless affair. I anticipate the readership of this and other such CPGs to grow\nand the information provided be useful for healthcare providers in their day to day management\nof patients. I would like to congratulate the multidisciplinary team for working together for many months to\nproduce this CPG. Members of the this CPG Expert Panel consist of experts from both the\nprivate and public sectors, from primary to tertiary care centres, and from across the country. Under the capable and enthusiastic leadership of Dr Robaayah Zambahari, supported by Dr\nJeyamalar Rajadurai, the Expert Panel regularly met to ensure the most recent and relevant\ninformation are incorporated into this CPG. I also thank members of the Panel of External\nReviewers for their efforts. Finally, I hope elements of this CPG will be put into practice on a daily basis, to tackle the\nproblem of dyslipidaemia in this country, and eventually result in a drop in mortality and morbidity\nassociated with vascular disease.", "chunk_order": 0}

CHD is a spectrum ranging from stable angina to\nacute coronary syndromes (ACS). The prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors \u2013 dyslipidaemia,\nhypertension, diabetes, smoking and overweight/obesity have been on an\nincreasing trend. Malaysians develop heart disease (ACS) at a younger age when\ncompared to people in Thailand, mainland China and western countries. Our local\nNCVD-ACS Registry (2011-2013), showed that most patients (96.8%) had at least\none established CV risk factor \u2013 hypertension (65%), dyslipidaemia (37%) and/or\ndiabetes (46%)2. In preventing CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global risks. This Clinical\nPractice Guideline (CPG) is on management of dyslipidaemia. The last CPG (4th\nedition) was published in 2011. Thus the need for an update. Objectives:\nThe objective of this clinical practice guideline is to review:\n\u2022\nThe\nclinical\nevidence\nlinking\ndyslipidaemia\nand\natherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis affects the entire vascular tree. However, evidence for a causal\nlink is strongest for CVD (heart disease and strokes). \u2022\nStrategies for assessing CV risk that is most applicable to our local\npopulation. \u2022\nEvidence based management of dyslipidaemia, utilising existing healthcare\nresources wherever possible. Process:\nThis CPG has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart\nAssociation of Malaysia, Ministry of Health and the Academy of Medicine. It\ncomprises cardiologists, endocrinologists, general physicians, pharmacists and\ndieticians from the government and private sectors as well as from the Universities. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases \u2013 PubMed\nand Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. The following MeSH terms\nor free text terms were used either singly or in combination:\n\u201cHyperlipidaemia\u201d; \u201cDyslipidaemia\u201d; \u201cHypercholesterolemia\u201d; \u201cCholesterol\u201d;\n\u201cLDL-cholesterol\u201d \u201cHDL-cholesterol\u201d; \u201cTriglycerides\u201d; Diabetic dyslipidaemia\u201d\n2017\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and\npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from\nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were\nsearched to identify further studies. The search was conducted from August\n2010 (date of last review for previous CPG) till 31st August 2016. Local guidelines were also studied. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain\nfurther information. International guidelines mainly that from the American Heart\nAssociation/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the European\nSociety of Cardiology were used as main references. After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up by the members of the Expert\nPanel and submitted to the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and key health personnel in the major\nhospitals of the Ministry of Health and the Private Sector for review and feedback.

Period of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThis guidelines needs to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with\nrecent developments and knowledge that is being learnt. Applicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThis guideline was developed taking into account our local health resources. Blood\nchemistry for lipid profiles, liver and renal function tests can be done in all\ngovernment health facilities. Almost all the medications recommended (except for\nthe PCSK9 inhibitors) are approved for use in Malaysia and available in public\nhospitals as generics. This guideline aims to educate health care professional on strategies to optimize\nexisting resources in the management of dyslipidaemia. Facilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barrier for successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of knowledge\nof the:\n\u2022\nrole of cholesterol (especially LDL-Cholesterol) in the pathogenesis of\ncardiovascular disease\n\u2022\nbenefits of total cholesterol (especially LDL-Cholesterol) lowering\n\u2022\nsafety profile of pharmacotherapy\nImplementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical\ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\u2022\nIncreasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the\nimportance of knowing their individual CV risk. \u2022\nContinuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on CV\nrisk assessment tools and the implementation of appropriate preventative\nstrategies depending on each individual\u2019s CV risk status. This can be done\nbyroad shows, electronic media, and in house training sessions.

Introduction\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of mortality in both\nMalaysian men and women for more than a decade1,5. CVD includes coronary heart\ndisease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease (strokes) and peripheral arterial disease\n(PAD). According to the National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS) the prevalence of\nthe common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors among adults \u2265 18 years had been on\nan increasing trend.6\u20138 (Table 8, pg. 24). The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia\nhad risen by 46% over the 4 years, 2011 \u2013 20157,8. Almost 1 in 5 adults in the 18-19\nyear age group had hypercholesterolemia.8 The prevalence increased with age, from\n22.0% in the 18-19 year age group, reaching a peak of 68.8% among adults aged\n55-59 years. The prevalence was the same in both rural and urban areas. A similar\nsurvey carried out recently among 13-year old students from both urban and rural\npublic schools, found that almost 23% of them had total cholesterol >5.2\nmmol/L.9\nAlthough atherosclerosis affects the entire vascular tree- coronary, cerebral and\nperipheral vessels- the causal link between hypercholesterolemia and CVD (heart\ndisease and strokes) has been most well established.

(Section 4, pg. 30). Data from the National Cardiovascular Disease \u2013 Acute Coronary Syndrome\n(NCVD-ACS) Registry 2011-2013, indicated that Malaysians developed acute\ncoronary syndrome (ACS) at a younger age than that seen in neighbouring\ncountries.2 The mean age was 58.5 years and the peak incidence was in the 51-60\nyear age group.2 This is younger than that noted in Thailand (63.5 years)10 and\nSingapore (median: 68.3-69.2 years).11 About 6.6% of our patients admitted with\nACS were <40 years2. In the prevention of CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global risks. This\nguidelines emphasize:\n\u2022\nA multifactorial approach that addresses all risk factors. This is because the\nbenefits of modifying several risk factors simultaneously are synergistic. \u2022\nThat preventing CVD should be directed at global CVD burden rather than CHD\nalone.

It has been postulated that LDL-C levels of 1.3 to 1.8 mmol/L are physiologically\nnormal in man.51 There is a near absence of clinical CHD in populations with very low\nlevels of serum cholesterol throughout their life (TC < 3.9 mmol/L or LDL-C < 2.6\nmmol/L).52,53 The risk of CHD appears to increase progressively above these levels. In the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) Study the lowest incidence of\nCHD was seen in individuals at the lowest quartile of LDL-C suggesting that optimal\nvalues for both gender is < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/100 ml).54\nA recent analysis of selected observational studies suggests that there is an inverse\nrelationship between levels of LDL-C and all-cause mortality in the elderly (> 60\nyears)55.

A 1\nmmol/L reduction in LDL-C reduces CV mortality by 22%.70 A meta regression\nanalysis showed that the use of statin and non-statin therapies that act via\nupregulation of LDL receptor expression (i.e. diet, bile acid sequestrants, ileal\nbypass, and ezetimibe) lead to similar reduction in major CV events per 1 mmol/L\nreduction in LDL-C.71\nStatins have consistently been shown to reduce CV events, are safe, well-tolerated\nand cost effective. 4.2\nLow HDL-C levels\nThere is substantial epidemiological evidence linking low HDL-C levels (< 1.0\nmmol/L) with increased risk of CHD.15,72 A 1% decrease in HDL-C, in epidemiological\nstudies, has been associated with 2-3% increase in CHD risk.15\nClinical trials using pharmacotherapy to increase HDL-C levels have, however, not\nshown any CV benefit.73-76\n4.3\nElevated TG levels\nThe role of TG as a CV risk factor is controversial and not as robust as is with\nLDL-C.14,77\u201380 It is now widely believed that TG is not directly atherogenic but remains\na biomarker of CV risk via its association with remnant lipoproteins and\nApoCIII.14\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017\nTwo studies have suggested that non-fasting TG measurements are more predictive\nof CV risk than fasting TG.17,81 Non-fasting TG more accurately reflects the presence\nof atherogenic remnant lipoproteins compared to fasting TG measurements. There\nis however a lack of a standardized protocol for quantitation of post-prandial\nhypertriglyceridemia. This limits its clinical applicability. Recent clinical trials with pharmacotherapy (fibrates and niacin) that were\nspecifically directed at reducing TG levels have not however, shown any benefit in\nreducing CV events.76,82\u201385\n4.4\nElevated Non-HDL-C levels\nNon-HDL-C reflects the concentration of cholesterol within all lipoprotein particles\nconsidered atherogenic. Studies have demonstrated that non-HDL-C is a better\npredictor of CV risk than is LDL-C and may be especially true in statin-treated\npatients.16,86\u201392 A prospective study demonstrated that non-HDL-C levels conferred a\nsimilar risk of future major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as LDL-C in patients with\nclinically manifest cerebrovascular, coronary artery or polyvascular diseases.89\nAchieved non-HDL-C levels seem more closely associated with coronary atheroma\nprogression than LDL-C.93 Among statin-treated patients, on-treatment levels of\nLDL-C, non\u2013HDL-C, and apo B were each associated with risk of future major CV\nevents, but the strength of this association was greater for non\u2013HDL-C than for\nLDL-C and apoB.16\nNon-HDL-C has however, not been used as a target of therapy in either primary or\nsecondary prevention clinical trials. 4.5\nAtherogenic Dyslipidaemia\nThis consists of low HDL-C, raised TG and small dense LDL particles.94,95 The LDL-C\nlevels are usually normal but there is a higher proportion of small dense LDL\nparticles which are more atherogenic.", "chunk_order": 18}

Both Thailand and\nSingapore have their own CV risk score which is based on the older Framingham\nRisk Score (10-year risk of CHD deaths, Non-fatal MI only) adapted\nto the local populations.112,113\nThe risk score that is widely used in Malaysia is the Framingham General CVD risk\nscore tool (FRS-General CVD) for primary care that assesses the 10-year risk of\ndeveloping CVD (heart disease, strokes, PAD and heart failure).3 (Tables 1 & 2 pg. 17-18) It can also be calculated online at https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/\nrisk-functions/cardiovascular-disease/10-year-risk.php\nThe earlier version of the Framingham Risk Score CHD (2002) provided a risk\nestimate of \u201chard\u201d CHD events only i.e. cardiac death and non-fatal MI.

For a more detailed discussion of nutrition\nfor health and weight loss, refer to the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines\nPrimary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, 1st Ed. 2017.139\nTLC is an essential component of the treatment of dyslipidaemia from the initial\ndiagnosis. It is especially important in obese individuals, smokers and those who\nlead a sedentary lifestyle. It should be emphasized in both primary and secondary\nprevention. (Table 6, pg. 21)\nDietary therapy is aimed at optimising lipid levels while maintaining a balanced diet. It is advised to refer to a dietician for medical nutrition therapy (MNT). Dietary\ntherapy is continued to empower the individual to manage their stages of change to\nachieve their nutritional goal. To optimize outcomes, motivational interviews are\nbeneficial.140\n7.1.1.1\nDietary Cholesterol\nThe role of serum cholesterol (especially LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of\natherosclerosis and CVD is consistent and robust. (Section 4, pg. 30). The\ncontribution of dietary cholesterols to blood cholesterol levels is however, more\ncomplex and controversial. The question is whether eating food high in cholesterol\nleads to high serum cholesterol and LDL-C, and whether limiting dietary cholesterol\nintake lowers serum LDL-C.141\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017\nRecent data indicate that the impact of dietary cholesterol on serum\ncholesterol levels is weak.131,142 However, many high-cholesterol foods also\ncontain high levels of saturated fats (SFA). This includes dairy products, meat\nand most processed foods. For this reason, international lipid guidelines\nrecommend limiting dietary cholesterol to < 200 mg/day in secondary\nprevention.131,143\n7.1.1.2\nTotal Fats, Saturated Fats and Unsaturated Fats\nThe recommended total fat intake is between 20 to 25% with an upper limit\nof 30% of total energy intake in all individuals.144,145 (Table 6, pg.", "chunk_order": 25}

A central issue in the relationship between SFA and CVD is the specific\nmacronutrients that are used to replace it in the diet.142 When SFA is replaced\nwith:\n\u2022\nPUFA, there is consistent data that CV events and coronary mortality\nare reduced.142\n\u2022\nMUFA or CHO, the evidence is not that clear that it lowers CVD risk.140,142\n\u2022\nExcess CHO, it may, in fact, contribute to an atherogenic dyslipidaemia\nwith small dense LDL, low HDL-C levels, insulin resistance and\nobesity.140,142\nTaking PUFA or MUFA (e.g. 1 teaspoon of olive oil/ virgin coconut oil) without\ncutting down SFA intake will not confer CV benefit.

A low carbohydrate (CHO) diet (< 26% of total enegy intake)\nresults in a significant reduction in TG levels, an increase in HDL-C levels and\na shift from small dense LDL-C to the larger buoyant LDL-C even in the\npresence of a high SFA diet and in the absence of weight loss.164\u2013169 The Low\nFat diet, on the other hand, required weight loss for an improvement in the\natherogenicprofile.167\nThe effects of a low CHO diet on long term health are unknown.142, 170,171\n7.1.2\nExercise\nRegular exercise reduces the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in both\nhealthy individuals and patients with CVD by 20\u201330%.172\u2013174\nStudies show that regular aerobic exercise can:175,176\n\u2022\nincrease HDL-C by 3\u201310% (up to 0.16 mmol/L)\n\u2022\nreduce TG by about 11% (up to 0.34 mmol/L)\nVigorous aerobic exercise improves HDL-C more than less-intense exercise.175\nThe decrease in TG with exercise is acute and short-lived, becomes evident\n12-18 hours after a single bout of exercise and lasts for 2-3 days.177 It requires\nthat a certain amount of energy (a threshold) be expended during exercise,\nindependent of duration or intensity.", "chunk_order": 28}

LDL-C reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid lowering\ntherapy to reduce risk of CVD.108\u2013111 They are the drugs of choice in reducing\nLDL-C because of the consistent results of numerous randomized primary and\nsecondary prevention clinical trials.108\u2013111\nThe amount of CV risk reduction seen will depend on the absolute risk of the\nindividual and the degree of LDL-C lowering that is achieved (level of LDL-C\nachieved and/or the percentage reduction).70,108,109,132\u2013137 Depending on the on\ntreatment level of LDL-C level achieved, lipid modifying agents can slow the\nprogression or even promote regression of coronary atherosclerotic\nplaques.132\u2013134,186,187 An achieved treatment LDL-C level of <1.8 mmol/L\nappears to significantly slow down progression of atherosclerosis. 132\u2013134,186,187\nStatins have moderate effect in lowering TG and in elevating HDL-C. (Table\n11, pg. 49)\nTreatment is initiated at the recommended starting dose with the evening meal\nor at bed time especially with simvastatin.188 Small short term clinical studies\nindicated that the LDL-C fell significantly by 5-8% when simvastatin was taken\nin the evening rather than in the morning.189\u2013193\nSince cholesterol is biosynthesized in the early morning hours, statins with\nshorter half-lives (lovastatin 2 hours, simvastatin <5 hours, and fluvastatin <3\nhours) should be administered in the evening. In contrast, statins with longer\nhalf-lives (atorvastatin 14 hours, rosuvastatin 19 hours, and pravastatin 22\nhours) can be administered during the day.188,194\nStatin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. It should not be\nprescribed to women of child bearing potential unless adequate contraception\nis taken. If pregnancy is planned, then statins should be discontinued.

Liver Function\n\u2022\nHepatic transaminases should be measured at baseline and at 1 to 3 months\nafter starting treatment and/or following a change in dose. \u2022\nIf levels are elevated prior to therapy, other causes (e.g. fatty liver, hepatitis)\nshould be excluded. If due to fatty liver, lipid lowering therapy is not\ncontraindicated. \u2022\nMild elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT) occurs in < 3% of patients on statin\ntreatment, more commonly with potent statins or high doses.201\nEdition of\nClinical Practice Guidelines\n5\nth\n\u2022\nMild elevation of ALT has not been shown to be associated with true\nhepatotoxicity or changes in liver function. \u2022\nWhen transaminase levels (especially ALT) are > 3 times the upper limit of\nnormal (ULN) on 2 occasions, the drug should be stopped. Reversal of\ntransaminase elevation is frequently noted with reduction of the dose or\ncessation of the drug. \u2022\nCautious reintroduction of therapy may be considered under close monitoring\nafter ALT values have returned to normal. \u2022\nProgression to liver failure is exceedingly rare. Routine monitoring of ALT\nduring long term statin treatment is no longer recommended.202\nB.2. Muscle Symptoms\n\u2022\nIn clinical practice and registries, 10-30% of patients report statin-associated\nmuscle symptoms (SAMS).203,204 This includes myalgia (normal creatine\nkinase (CK)), myositis (CK > ULN) and rhabdomyolysis (CK > 10X of ULN). \uf0d8 The incidence of SAMS is much lower in clinical trials, and only differs\nslightly from placebo.205-207 In observational studies, the frequency\nvaries between 10 and 15%208-209. In a study by Parker designed\nspecifically to study the effects of statins on muscle symptoms, the\nfrequency of muscle-related complaints was approximately 9%.210\n\uf0d8 Myalgia (without CK elevation) occurs in 5-10% of patients in clinical\npractice.210 If the symptoms are not tolerable or are progressive, the dose\nof statin should be reduced or the drug stopped. \uf0d8 The incidence of myopathy (myositis and rhabdomyolysis) is low and is\nmore likely to occur in persons with complex medical problems (in particular\nCKD) and/or who are taking multiple medications, or in elderly persons,\nespecially women. \u2022\nCreatine Kinase (CK) is not routinely measured unless myositis is suspected. If\nthe level is more than five times the ULN on two occasions, the drug should be\ndiscontinued. \u2022\nThere is no uniform definition for statin intolerance.", "chunk_order": 32}

If\nthe level is more than five times the ULN on two occasions, the drug should be\ndiscontinued. \u2022\nThere is no uniform definition for statin intolerance. In certain trials; \u2018statin\nintolerant\u2019 patients are defined as patients unable to tolerate at least two different\nstatins because of unexplained skeletal muscle-related symptoms (pain, aches,\nweakness, or cramping) that began or increased during statin therapy and\nreturned to baseline when statin therapy was discontinued.205\n\u2022\nWhen a statin myopathy is suspected, typically the first step is statin\ndiscontinuation for 2-3 weeks. \uf0d8 If symptoms have not resolved, it is unlikely to be statin related and the\npatient should be continued on the same dose of statin\n\uf0d8 If symptoms have resolved, then the following strategies may be\nconsidered:\n\u25aa Lowering the dose or decreasing the frequency to less than daily.211\n\u25aa An alternative dosing such as every other day or twice a week with\natorvastatin or rosuvastatin212 can be used\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017\n\u25aa\nTreatment with the highest tolerable dose of statin in combination\nwith a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe),\n\u25aa\nIf indicated, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered.213,214\n92% of statin intolerant patients do well with a second statin.211\n73% will tolerate a re-challenge with a third statin.211\n\u2022\nAn alternative approach is to consider co-enzyme Q10 to alleviate the\nsymptoms of myalgia. The relationship between co-enzyme Q10 and\nstatin related muscle symptoms is circumstantial. However, the risk of\nside effects from co-enzyme Q10 is low. Thus a trial of co-enzyme Q10\nin patients with possible statin related muscle side effects may be\nconsidered. The response rate is variable.215\u2013217\n\u2022\nThe routine use of co-enzyme Q10 together with statins is unproven and\ntherefore not recommended.215\u2013217\nCare should be taken when prescribing high doses of simvastatin\n(>20 mg/daily) together with certain other medications that inhibit the\ncytochrome P450 pathway. It has the potential of increasing the risk of muscle\ninjury.218,219\nB.3. Diabetes\n\u2022\nStatins have been associated with a slight increase in new-onset\ndiabetes (9-12%)220,221. It occurs with all statins and may be dose\nrelated. \u2022\nThe CV reduction benefits seen with statins far outweigh the risk of\ndeveloping diabetes.

Kidney Effects\n\u2022\nAn increased frequency of proteinuria has been reported for all statins,\nmore so for rosuvastatin. \u2022\nThe proteinuria induced by statins is of tubular origin and is due to\nreduced tubular reabsorption and not to glomerular dysfunction.223\n\u2022\nIn clinical trials the frequency of proteinuria is in general, low and in\nmost cases is not higher than for placebo.224\n\u2022\nAs such, we do not recommend routine monitoring of renal function or\nproteinuria.224\nB.5. Neurocognitive function\n\u2022\nRegulatory bodies have required that a statement be added to the drug\nlabel for all statins indicating that there is a potential for cognitive\nside-effects (such as memory loss and confusion).225\n\u2022\nClinical studies designed to assess the effect of statins on cognitive\nfunction have, however, found little to no evidence that statins are\nassociated with adverse effects on memory or cognition.226,227\nB.6. Others\n\u2022\nThere is no evidence that patients on statins have increased risk of\nnon-CV mortality (e.g. cancers, suicides). 7.2.1.2 Optimising Statin Therapy\nThe therapeutic doses of statins used in clinical practice should be similar\nbetween Asian and Caucasian populations. Studies conducted among Asian\nand Caucasian subjects concluded that systemic exposure to atorvastatin did\nnot differ between the two groups.228,229\n\u2022\nHigh-intensity statin therapy produces a greater percentage LDL-C\nreduction and thus reduces CV events more than moderate-intensity\nstatin therapy.108-111(Table 12, pg. 54)\n\u2022\nLower-intensity statin therapy has also been shown to reduce CV events,\nbut to a lesser degree.108-111\n\u2022\nVery High Risk and High Risk individuals should be treated with the\nmaximum appropriate intensity of a statin that does not cause adverse\neffects.108,109,132\u2013137\nIII, B\nI, A\nI, A\nI, A\nManagement of Dyslipidaemia 2017\nTable 12: Recommended Doses of Statin Therapy#\n7.2.1.3 Adhering to Statin Therapy\n\u2022\nThe importance of LDL-C lowering to prevent CVD is strongly emphasized.
