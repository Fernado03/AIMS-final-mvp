There are many good clinical data to\nindicate that the use of HT started in early menopause is effective\nand safe. Despite all this, both doctors and the public are still apprehensive\nand anxious about its continued use. Prevailing misconceptions and\nmisinterpretations about HT may be contributed by several factors,\nincluding cultural practices, social mores, misinformation through\nmedia, and differing practices of medical personnel based on\ninconsistent\nscientific\ndata. Access\nto\ninformation\nthrough\nunmonitored media and internet has to some extent, contributed to\nconfusing information playing down the value of good scientific facts. The HT users and prescribers have opened themselves to such\ninfluences. What they really need to do is to broaden their\nknowledge of the menopause and its treatment and assess its\nappropriateness in the light of recent scientific evidence. The results of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) study has initially\nraised anxiety on HT use for the menopause, but it is prudent to\nrefer to the many international criticisms of this study, and its\nrelevance only to certain age groups with allied clinical profiles. It is therefore timely to re-look at the current evidence available and\nsee how scientific data will impact on HT use in Malaysian\npostmenopausal women. The production of these Clinical Practice\nGuidelines (CPG) is largely based on review of such data and\nacceptable clinical practice. The CPG Committee has carefully deliberated on much of the\navailable scientific data to come out with various Consensus\nStatements and the CPG. Input has also been given by invited nongynaecology experts in the areas of bone, cardiovascular and breast\nhealth. To further make this document credible, local and\ninternational reviewers have been invited to critically review the\ndocument before its final print.", "chunk_order": 0}

SOURCE OF FUNDING\nThis CPG was made possible by an unrestricted educational grant\nfrom Pfizer (M) Sdn Bhd. COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS & GYNAECOLOGISTS\nAcademy of Medicine of Malaysia\nClinical Practice Guidelines on\n\u201cHormone Therapy during Menopause in Malaysian Women\u201d\nI. TITLE\nThe title of this document is\nHORMONE THERAPY DURING MENOPAUSE IN MALAYSIAN\nWOMEN. II. BASIS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS CPG\nHormone Therapy (HT) has been the mainstay for treatment of\nmenopause. When the results of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative\n(WHI) study were published in 2002 and 2004, concerns were raised\nabout the safety of HT use and this caused anxiety and concern to\nboth medical professionals and the public. There are, currently, many new research evidences available,\nespecially on the safe use of HT in early menopause. The College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists, Academy of\nMedicine of Malaysia, in line with its academic aspirations, decided\nto produce an updated Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) in the\nhope that this would benefit medical practitioners in Malaysia when\nfaced with the issue of menopause treatment in their clinical practice. The College enlisted other relevant agencies to participate in this\nventure, namely the Obstetrical & Gynaecological Society of\nMalaysia, the Malaysian Menopause Society, the Academy of\nFamily Physicians of Malaysia, and the Ministry of Health Malaysia. The CPG Committee was tasked with deliberation of the available\nscientific data. Experts in the areas of bone health, cardiovascular\nhealth and breast health were invited to give their input, and\nevaluation of the final document by local & international assessors\nwas sought to lend credibility to this document. III. CLINICAL QUESTIONS ADDRESSED\nWhen considering the use of HT in postmenopausal women,\nmedical practitioners may have important questions on their minds. Such questions include:\n\u2022\nwhat are the clinical benefits of HT ? \u2022\nwhat are the risk situations in HT use ? \u2022\nwho would benefit from HT ? \u2022\nwhen to start HT ? \u2022\nhow does one prescribe HT ? \u2022\nwhat are the dose regimes ? \u2022\nis there a time limit to its use ?", "chunk_order": 2}

This Clinical Practice Guidelines will serve to answer many of the\nabove questions, and allow the medical practitioner more confidence\nin the clinical use of HT in their practice. IV. TARGET GROUP\nThis CPG was developed for medical practitioners in Malaysia who\nare involved in the management of postmenopausal women. V. TARGET POPULATION\nThis CPG was developed for the safe use of estrogen therapy and\nestrogen-progestin therapy for postmenopausal women in Malaysia. VI. PROCESS\n1. This CPG Committee was established by the College of\nObstetricians & Gynaecologists, Academy of Medicine of\nMalaysia on September 3, 2008. 2. Representation into this committee was sought from the\nMalaysian\nMenopause\nSociety,\nthe\nObstetrical\n&\nGynaecological Society of Malaysia, the Academy of\nFamily Physicians of Malaysia, and the Ministry of Health\nMalaysia. 3. The first meeting of the CPG Committee was held on 2202-09, and altogether the committee has had 7 monthly\nmeetings. 4. Initially, during the meetings, the committee members\nlooked at various scientific evidence related to various\nparameters pertaining to the menopause, and how\nhormone therapy affected these. 5. Scientific evidence was obtained through review of current\nmedical literature on hormone therapy and menopause\nusing search engines available online. ( The search engines include Yahoo Search, Medline, e\nMedicine,\nGoogle,\nWebMD,\nSearch\nMedica,\nMdLinx.ObGyn,\nMedscape.OB/GYN,\nDocGuide,\nORGYN.com, websites of the International Menopause\nSociety, North American Menopause Society, British\nMenopause Society, Australasian Menopause Society. )\n( Key words used in the searches \u2013 menopause,\nmenopause-heart disease, -VTE, -stroke, -vagina, -quality\nof life, -sexuality, -urinary tract, -breast cancer, -\nmenopausal symptoms, -depression, -sleep, -skin, -bone\nhealth, -colon cancer.)\nThe committee looked at mainly meta-analysis, systematic\nreviews, randomized controlled trials, longitudinal cohort\nstudies, and others. International guidelines on the subject were also referred to. 6. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation used in\nthis CPG follow that of the SIGN50 criteria, revised edition\n2008, Reference 82 in the list of references. The details of\nthe SIGN50 criteria are enclosed in this CPG document. These were applied to the section on \u201c Clinical Benefits of\nHormone Therapy \u201d and the list of References. 7. During the course of the meetings, experts in the areas of\ncardiovascular, bone and breast health during menopause\nwere invited to participate in the discussions. 8. The draft copy of this CPG was then produced by the CPG\nCommittee, and circulated to all its members for scrutiny\nand feedback comments. Following this, the final draft copy was produced. 9.", "chunk_order": 3}

The final draft copy was then sent to 2 local reviewers for\ntheir comments. These comments were reported to the\nCPG Committee at its last meeting on 27-09-09, and\nfurther modifications were made. 10. The modified final draft copy was then sent to 2\ninternational reviewers and their comments sought. 11. After receiving the international reviewers comments, the\nCPG document was then prepared\n12. The CPG document was then sent to the Health\nTechnology\nAssessment\nUnit,\nMedical\nDevelopment\nDivision, Ministry of Health Malaysia for assessment. 13. The CPG Committee had agreed that this CPG will be\nreviewed in 3 years time and any new data pertaining to\nthe subject matter of this CPG will be reviewed, discussed,\nand modifications made to the CPG wherever necessary. No pharmaceutical company has been directly involved in the\npreparation, discussion and finalization of this document. The CPG Committee wishes to emphasise that this document\nserves as a guideline for clinical practice in the use of HT for\nmenopause in Malaysian women. When in doubt, readers should relook at the references quoted and after re-evaluation of the data, act\nappropriately for their patient\u2019s benefit.

OBJECTIVES\nOverall Objective\nThe overall objective is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of\nclinical care in the area of hormone therapy for menopause through\nthe identification of evidence-based good clinical practice and\ndesired clinical outcomes. Specific Objectives\n1. To provide medical practitioners in Malaysia with a working\nknowledge of the clinical benefits and risks of the use of\nhormone therapy, i.e. estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogenprogestin therapy (EPT) for female menopause. 2. To provide medical practitioners in Malaysia with practical\nworking guidelines on the use of ET and EPT for female\nmenopause. VIII. DEFINITIONS\nThe following definitions will be used in this document:\nMenopause\nMenopause is a state of natural ovarian senescence with\naccompanying estrogen deficiency. It also refers to states of ovarian\nfailure and ovarian destruction/removal with accompanying estrogen\ndeficiency. Premature Menopause ( 15, 96, 97 )\nThis refers to menopause in a woman aged below 40 years. Early Menopause\nThis refers to menopause in a woman aged 50 years to 59 years. Late Menopause\nThis refers to menopause in a woman aged 60 years and over. Surgical menopause refers to menopause occurring as a result of\nsurgical removal of both ovaries in a woman. Medical menopause refers to menopause occurring as a result of\npermanent damage to both ovaries in a woman following either\nchemotherapy or radiotherapy. ( NB. Women with either surgical or medical menopause can be\nallocated to one of the menopause groups above. )\nHormone Therapy (HT)\nThis refers to the use of estrogens (ET), estrogens plus progestins\n(EPT) and androgens (AT). Estrogen-Progestin Therapy (EPT)\nThis refers to therapy with estrogen in combination with a progestin. This term is synonymous with the term \u201chormone replacement\ntherapy\u201d (HRT). Estrogen Therapy (ET)\nThis refers to therapy with estrogens alone. This term is synonymous with the term \u201cestrogen replacement\ntherapy\u201d (ERT).", "chunk_order": 5}

Estrogen-Progestin Therapy (EPT)\nThis refers to therapy with estrogen in combination with a progestin. This term is synonymous with the term \u201chormone replacement\ntherapy\u201d (HRT). Estrogen Therapy (ET)\nThis refers to therapy with estrogens alone. This term is synonymous with the term \u201cestrogen replacement\ntherapy\u201d (ERT). Standard Dose ET & EPT*\nEssentially this refers to the dose of estrogen in the preparation, viz,\n\u2022\nConjugated equine estrogens 0.625mg\n\u2022\nEstradiol valerate 2.0mg\nLow Dose ET & EPT*\nEssentially this refers to the dose of estrogen in the preparation, viz,\n\u2022\nConjugated equine estrogens 0.30mg or 0.45mg\n\u2022\nEstradiol valerate 1.0mg\n( NB * for the actual preparations available, please refer to\nAPPENDIX II and other relevant drug compendiums for details )\nIX. DIAGNOSIS OF MENOPAUSE\nThe diagnosis of menopause is mainly clinical, viz\na. Clinical Criteria\n1. age around menopause ( around 50 years )\n2. no periods for 12 months\n3. menopausal symptoms\n( NB. All 3 clinical criteria need not be present for a diagnosis )\nLaboratory diagnosis is generally not necessary for the diagnosis of\nmenopause. However, where in doubt, laboratory testing of FSH\nmay support the diagnosis, viz\nb. Laboratory Criterion\n1. FSH level > 35miu/ml\n(NB. estradiol levels can be tested for, but this is not\nrequired for the establishment of diagnosis. )\nX. CLINICAL BENEFITS OF HORMONE THERAPY\nThe following benefits of hormone therapy have been reported by\nscientific studies:\n(NB Grades of recommendations \u2013 A to D, follow the SIGN50 criteria,\nreference 82, Appendix I )\na. VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS\nHot Flushes\n1. ET and EPT are effective in reducing the frequency of hot\nflushes. ( 1, 3-5, 12-13,18, 25, 30, 32 )\n2.

( 1, 3-5, 18, 25 )\nSweats / Night Sweats\n1. ET and EPT are effective in reducing the frequency of\nsweats, including night sweats. ( 2, 3, 4, 30 )\n2. ET and EPT are effective in reducing the severity of\nsweats, including night sweats. ( 2, 3, 4, 30 )\n3. Low-dose ET and EPT are also effective in reducing the\nfrequency and severity of sweats, including night sweats.

ET and EPT increase the vaginal maturation index and relieve\nvaginal atrophy. ( 1, 3, 5, 18, 51, 54, 55 )\n2. ET and EPT reduce vaginal dryness. ( 3, 5, 51, 52, 53 )\nEPT reduces the incidence of vaginal pain, dyspareunia,\nvaginal discharge, and burning sensation. ( 49 )\n3. The above effects are also seen with low-dose ET and EPT. ( 1, 3, 5, 18, 45 )\n4. There is better relief of vaginal symptoms and greater\nimprovement in cytological findings with topical vaginal\nestrogen therapy compared to oral estrogen therapy. ( 51, 52, 54 )\n5. Daily and twice weekly use of low dose estrogen cream was\nequally effective in relieving symptoms of vulvo-vaginal atrophy. ( 99 )\nEvidence statements\ni)\nLow-dose and standard dose ET are effective in relieving\nvaginal atrophy, and its related symptoms, e.g. vaginal\ndryness and dyspareunia ( painful coitus ).

EPT reduces the incidence of lower urinary symptoms, e.g. dysuria, frequency of micturition, nocturia. ( 3, 18, 49, 50, 52,\n53, )\nNB. However, with regards to urinary incontinence, stress and urge\nincontinence, most studies indicate that these conditions are not\nbenefited by ET and EPT, Instead ET and EPT use may\nworsen the above conditions. ( 12, 13, 50 )\nEvidence statements\ni)\nEPT is effective for relief of lower urinary tract\nsymptoms related to estrogen deficiency. (1+)\nii)\nMost studies show that in postmenopausal women with\nurinary incontinence, ET and EPT are not beneficial and\nmay worsen the condition.

EPT reduces the incidence of difficulty in sleeping, sleep\ndisturbances, and sleep problems. ( 2, 3, 4, 5, 32, 33 )\n2. ET decreases the sum of time spent awake during sleep,\nand increases the total time spent in rapid-eye-movement\nsleep. ( 34 )\n3. Sleep improvements with EPT may, however, be\nsecondary to reduction in hot flushes. ( 4 )\nEvidence statement\ni) ET and EPT are associated with improved sleep patterns and\nless sleeplessness. (1+)\nRecommendation\ni) Sleep disturbance related to menopause, particularly\nsleeplessness, is an indication for the use of ET and EPT. ( A )\nf. SKIN\n1. EPT improves various parameters associated with skin\naging, namely, decreases dryness, increases hydration,\nelasticity and skin thickness. ( 22, 23 )\nEvidence statement\ni) EPT use improves skin health during menopause. (1+)\nRecommendation\ni) Improvement of skin health per se is not an indication for\nthe use of EPT. ( \u221a )\ng. BONE\n1. ET and EPT increase bone mineral density ( BMD ) at both the\nhip and vertebral spine. ( 7, 9, 11, 18, 27 )\nThis response is dose-related for the vertebral spine. ( 18, 27 )\n2. Low dose EPT plus calcium supplements is more effective in\nincreasing BMD compared to EPT alone. ( 18, 27 )\n3. ET and EPT reduce bone turnover, as evidenced by bone\nturnover markers. ( 11, 18 )\n4. EPT reduces the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral ( hip &\nlower arm ) fractures. ( 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 27, 98 )\n5. The effect of EPT on non-vertebral fractures is greater in\nwomen below 60 years of age compared to those 60 and\nabove. ( 27 )\n6.

In the context of bone health, besides HT, other first-line\nchoices include calcitonin, bisphosphonates, and raloxifene. h. SEXUALITY\n1. ET and EPT improve various aspects of female sexuality. 2. ET and EPT increase sexual desire, sexual arousal, sexual\nactivity & its frequency, frequency and intensity of orgasm,\nsexual responsiveness, and overall sexual satisfaction. ( 36,\n37, 45 )\nET and EPT also decrease the incidence of sexuality\nproblems. ( 37 )\n3. The addition of testosterone to ET and EPT significantly\nfurther improves on the female sexuality issues mentioned\nabove. ( 39, 43, 44, 46, 47 )\nOne study showed that the use of testosterone alone\nimproves on sexuality in postmenopausal women. ( 38 )\nEvidence statements\ni) ET and EPT improves female sexual desire, sexual activity\nand overall sexual satisfaction in post-menopausal women. (1+)\nii) Testosterone supplementation of ET and EPT further\nimproves various aspects of sexual function in postmenopausal women.

ET use is associated with a reduction in the risk of colo-rectal\ncancer ( 24, 40, 41, 42 ). 2. EPT use is associated with a reduction in the risk of both\ninvasive colon cancer ( 26, 40, 41, 42 ) and rectal cancers\n( 26, 41 ). 3. Some studies show the longer the duration of use of ET and\nEPT, the higher the reduction in risk ( 24, 42 ), while others\ndo not show this ( 40, 41 ). 4. ET and EPT use are also associated with a reduction in the\nrisk of fatal colon cancer ( 40 ). Evidence statement\ni) ET and EPT use are associated with reduced incidences of\ncolon and rectal cancers.

With EPT, the risk of VTE has been shown to increase in\nwomen with other risk factors for VTE, e.g. increasing\nage, over-weight, obesity, presence of factor V Leiden\nmutation. ( 64, 65, 92 )\n3. With ET, VTE risk has been shown not to be increased\nfurther in women by age, BMI or presence of other risk\nfactors for VTE. ( 92 )\n4. With EPT, the risk is highest with the first year of use. ( 64, 67, 89, 92 ) and remains high for at least 5 years. ( 92 )\n5. With ET, the risk has been shown to be greatest in the\nfirst 2 years, and remains elevated after this. ( 92 )\n6. Use of oral estrogens increases the risk of VTE. ( 64, 66, 67, 92 )\n7. Use of transdermal estrogens does not appear to\nincrease the risk of VTE ( 64, 66, 67, 92 ), and has been\nshown not to confer additional risk in women at high risk\nof VTE.

ET and EPT increase the risk of stroke. ( 12, 13, 58, 60, 89, 90, 91 )\n2. ET increases the risk of ischaemic stroke in generally\nhealthy postmenopausal women, and this risk is present in\nall subgroups of women, including younger and more\nrecently menopausal women.

(1+)\nRecommendation\ni) ET and EPT are not to be used in postmenopausal women\nwith high risk for stroke. ( A )\nd. BREAST\nET use\n1. Overall, there is no increase in risk of breast cancer with\nthe use of ET ( 13, 70, 71, 74, 75, 77, 78 ). The WHI\nstudy showed that this is true up to 7.1 years of use ( 13 ),\nwhile other studies showed no increased risk up to 15\nyears ( 70, 95 ), and even up to 20 years of use. ( 75, 78 )\n2. For ductal cancers, studies showed, overall, that there is\nno increase in risk, even after 20 years of use of ET. ( 75,\n76, 78 ). Any increase in risk of ductal cancer was entirely\nrestricted to lean women with BMI < 25. ( 69, 75, 78 )\n3. For lobular cancers, one study showed that there is an\nincreased risk after 10 years of ET use. ( 78 )\n4. One study showed that there was a statistically significant\nincrease in risk of estrogen receptor and progesterone\nreceptor positive cancers after 15 years of ET use. (75 )\nEPT use\n1. Overall, with the use of EPT, there is an increase in risk of\nbreast cancer. The WHI study showed that this increase in\nrisk is seen after 5 years. ( 12 ). In other studies, the\nincreased risk is seen after the first 2- 3 years of use. ( 69,\n70, 71, 73, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 )\n2. There is a suggestion that the increase in risk of breast\ncancer is for lobular cancer, and not for ductal cancer. ( 71,\n73, 76 )\n3.

This\nwill give insight to the medical practitioner as to how best to counsel\nthe patient. The following conclusions are derived from a Malaysian\nsurvey and surveys from other international communities. ( please\nrefer to references 83 \u2013 88 in the \u201cReferences\u201d list )\n1. The top 3 most common menopausal symptoms experienced by\nMalaysian women are sleeplessness, headache and reduced\nsex drive. Nevertheless, the experience of menopausal symptoms can be\nquite varied in different populations.

It is also seen that the more negative the attitude to menopause\nand aging, the more likely is the woman to report presence of\nsymptoms. 2. In general, Malaysian women feel that menopause does affect\ntheir life somewhat, the greatest impact coming from symptoms\nsuch as joint aches and pains, followed closely by lack of\nphysical fitness. 3. The menopause experience in women is worse when associated\nwith perception of losses in life, e.g. loss of childbearing capacity,\nloss of culture, threatened loss of children. Menopause experience seems to focus on the difficult\nexperiences a woman undergoes in relation to family life and\nwork experiences. 4. Data shows that Malaysian women are not well informed about\nmenopause in general, but they agree slightly that severe\nmenopausal symptoms need to be treated. Overall, postmenopausal women are poorly informed about the\nmenopause, and they also have a poor understanding of it. Low\nawareness of HT is associated with its low prevalence of use. 5. Some of the most common sources of information that Malaysian\nwomen use or have ever used to get information on menopause\nare magazines, and newspapers, and the most sought-after\npeople for information are acquaintances and family doctors. However, it has been shown that doctors and health-care\nprofessionals provide little information about HT. Nevertheless, women do have a genuine desire for more\ninformation about menopause and its treatment. 6. HT is not the most common treatment for menopausal\ncomplaints. For those who are currently using HT or had ever\nused HT, they have a somewhat positive feeling about HT. In Malaysia, only about 10% of postmenopausal women are\ntaking HT, while 30-40% are on herbal remedies. Headache is the main menopausal symptom that prompted most\nMalaysian women to seek treatment. 7. For Malaysian women who are on HT for their menopausal\nsymptoms, the gynaecologist is the influencer to most women in\nstarting HT. Most women perceive HT only for short-term relief of symptoms,\nrather than for its long-term benefits. European women also believe that HT is good for the prevention\nof osteoporosis. 8. Only 8% of women had stopped using HT once, and they were\nadvised by their family doctor to stop on medical grounds. Other reasons for stopping HT include side-effects, concern\nabout long-term health, e.g. breast cancer and VTE,\ndisappearance of menopausal symptoms, and weight gain. 9. The main benefit women associate with HT use is alleviation of\nsymptoms, and the main risk associated with HT is developing\nbreast cancer. In western countries, women also include prevention of\nosteoporosis as a benefit. 10.", "chunk_order": 14}

Though most women have somewhat positive feelings about HT\nin general, there is a significant number of women who are not\naware of the benefits and consequences of using HT. Overall, women have both positive and negative benefits about\nHT. Women were more likely to use HT if they have symptoms. 11. The number one hurdle for women to start using HT is the fear of\nbreast cancer, and belief that HT cannot alleviate the symptoms. Studies show that the reasons for refusal to start taking HT\ninclude: belief that menopause is a natural event, hence, there is\nno need for any treatment; that HT is unnatural and with potential\ndangers; HT was never recommended to them; their doctor was\nagainst HT use. 12. Data shows that gynaecologists and doctors can be the main\ninfluencer of using HT. On the other hand, it has also been shown that most of the\nwomen were not recommended to use HT by their doctors. In never-users, one reason for not using HT is that HT was never\noffered to them.

Explanation on risks should be made in absolute numbers as this\nwould be more appropriate rather than in percentages or relative\nrisks, as follows:\n* WHI ( 2002 ) Absolute risks of EPT ( ref 12 ) New cases Additional\nabsolute risks\nheart disease\n7\n7 / 10,000\nstroke\n8\n8 / 10,000\nbreast cancer\n8\n8 / 10,000\nVTE\n18 18 / 10,000\npulmonary embolism\n8\n8 / 10,000\n* WHI ( 2004 ) Absolute risks of ET ( ref 13 ) New cases Additional\nabsolute risks\nheart disease\n-5\n-5 / 10,000\nstroke\n12\n12 /10,000\nVTE\n7\n7 / 10,000\nbreast cancer\n-7\n-7 / 10,000\nOne should also take into account the woman\u2019s own preferences\nand expectations. Only after this, can the woman make an informed, individual\ndecision on whether or not she would want to take HT. 4.", "chunk_order": 16}

Pre-treatment Evaluation\nThis should include taking a medical history, relevant family history,\ndoing a physical examination including weight, height, BMI, blood\npressure and breast examination. Where possible, a bimanual vaginal examination and cervical\ncytology should be done. Relevant investigations can be considered, either laboratory or\nimaging - these are not mandatory. These include mammography /\nsonography, cardiovascular risk profiles including lipid profile,\ndiabetes screening, full blood count etc. Mammography should be undertaken according to age and national\nguidelines. Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered on\na case-to-case basis. Other tests may be done on a case-to-case basis, e.g. liver function\ntests, thyroid profiles, ultrasonography of the pelvis. 5. Contra-indications\nContra-indications to HT should be ruled out before starting HT. These include the following:\n\u2022\nhistory of breast cancer\n\u2022\nhistory of VTE or stroke\n\u2022\nundiagnosed uterine bleeding\n\u2022\nsignificant cardiovascular disease\n\u2022\nhypersensitivity to estrogen. 6. Timing of Initiation\nInitiation of HT should be done in relation to proximity to menopause. Thus, it is best to start HT between the ages of 50-59 years, or\nwithin 10 years of the menopause. After the age of 60 years, HT should not be initiated unless there is a\ncompelling indication. For those with premature menopause, HT should be recommended\nand started as soon as possible. 7. Dosages\nAs a principle, the lowest effective dose of estrogen consistent with\ntreatment goals should be used, with a corresponding low dose of\nprogestogen. Low-dose HT has been shown to be as effective as standard-dose\nHT for most of the indications mentioned above, and hence, should\nbe the first-line choice. Lower doses of progestogen will have less negative effect on breast\ncancer risk. For women with premature menopause, higher doses of\nestrogen may be required for relief. 8. Addition of progestogen\nIn a woman with an intact uterus, progestogen is added to systemic\nestrogen. This provides endometrial protection from unopposed estrogen and\nprevents the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Progestogens should be given for 12-14 days for every 28 days of\nestrogen ( cyclical ), or it can be given together with estrogen on a\ndaily basis ( continuous ). When using low-dose vaginal estrogen for relief of uro-genital\natrophy, there is no necessity for added progestogen. Progestogen supplementation is also not generally required in a\nwoman who has had a hysterectomy, and who is on ET. 9. Dose Regimes\nThere are multiple dosing regime options especially for endometrial\nsafety when adding progestogen to estrogen (EPT). There are also\nmultiple dosing regimes when using ET.", "chunk_order": 17}

Progestogen supplementation is also not generally required in a\nwoman who has had a hysterectomy, and who is on ET. 9. Dose Regimes\nThere are multiple dosing regime options especially for endometrial\nsafety when adding progestogen to estrogen (EPT). There are also\nmultiple dosing regimes when using ET. For ET, estrogens can be given as standard or low dose, viz:\nestrogen\nstandard dose\nlow dose\nconjugated equine estrogen\n0.625mg\n0.3mg\n17\u03b2 estradiol valerate\n2.0mg\n0.5mg \u2013 1.0mg\nmicronised estradiol\n1.0 \u2013 2.0mg\n0.25 \u2013 0.5mg\ntransdermal estradiol\n50-100mcg\n25mcg\n______________________________________________________________________________________\nFor EPT, progestogens should be added to the estrogen doses above, viz:\nprogestogen\nstandard dose\nlow dose\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate\n2.5 \u2013 5.0mg\n1.5mg\nnorethindrone acetate\n1.0 \u2013 2.0mg\n0.1 \u2013 0.5mg\ndrosperinone\n2.0mg\n0.5mg\nmicronised progesterone\n100mg\n50mg\n______________________________________________________________________________________\nThe dose and regime of HT need to be individualized. This is the key to successful use of HT to provide health benefit with\nminimal risks, thereby enhancing quality of life. Older postmenopausal women generally require lower doses than\nyounger women. 10. Routes of administration\nThese include oral and transdermal routes. Transdermal routes include the patch, gel and implant. There is currently no symptomatic benefit of one route of\nadministration over the other for systemic ET. Both oral and non-oral\nroutes have advantages and disadvantages. Transdermal routes have the advantage of avoiding the first-pass\nliver effect, and may be more favourable than oral routes, especially\nwith regard to VTE and cardiovascular risks. Estrogen administered vaginally\nWhen used for the treatment of vulvo-vaginal symptoms,\nconsideration should be given to the use of local vaginal products. The use of vaginal estrogen products for the treatment of atrophic\nvaginitis is well documented. Creams have the advantage over tablets in their ability to be applied\ndirectly to the vulva and vulvo-vaginal area and provide flexibility in\ndosing and frequency of administration. The most widely prescribed\nlocal vaginal therapy for vaginal atrophy is conjugated equine\nestrogens ( CE ) cream. Studies have shown the effectiveness of CE cream in reducing the\nsign of atrophic vaginitis as measured by effects on the vaginal\nmaturation index ( VMI ). Even the use of low dose vaginal estrogens, given daily or twice\nweekly have proven effective for the same purpose. 11. Duration of use\nThere is no mandatory limitation to the duration of HT use,\nespecially when HT is started during the menopause transition, and\nthe woman is symptom-free on HT. HT should be given for as long as the woman wants, if the lowest\neffective dose is used; the woman is aware of the potential benefits\nand risks; and there is clinical supervision.", "chunk_order": 18}

HT can be considered even in the absence of symptoms where\nthere is a genuine need for further prevention of osteoporotic\nfractures and/or preservation of bone mass in women with\nosteopenia when alternative therapies are not appropriate. 12. Follow-up Assessment & Frequency\nAnnual risk-benefit assessment should be carried out. The same procedures as in the \u201cCounselling\u201d visit and the \u201cPreTreatment Evaluation\u201d should be considered. Timely mammography is the key, including genital tract cancer\nstudies, e.g. cervical cytology and other investigations. A 12-monthly follow-up assessment is recommended. As for mammography, if the initial mammogram is normal, 2-3\nyearly mammography is recommended. 13. Premature menopause\nWomen with premature menopause should be considered as a\ngroup with special needs compared to those with natural\nmenopause. Special counseling in various areas needs to be addressed. Premature menopause is associated with a lower risk of breast\ncancer, but with a higher risk and earlier onset of osteoporosis and\ncardiovascular disease. HT should be started as soon as possible. HT is to be continued until the typical natural normal age of\nmenopause. Higher doses of HT may be required in these women for symptom\nrelief. The risks of HT attributable to these young women are likely to be\nsmaller and the benefits potentially greater than those in older\nwomen. Nevertheless, the merits of long-term use of HT need to be\nassessed for each individual at regular intervals. Conclusion\nBesides the role of life-style modifications and dietary adjustments in\nthe prevention of menopause-related disease, HT ( hormone\ntherapy ) remains a principal tool in preventing menopause-related\nillnesses and maintaining quality of life in the post-menopausal\nwoman.", "chunk_order": 19}
