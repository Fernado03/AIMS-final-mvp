There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee\nduring the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane\ndatabases. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion criteria are all infants with risk of developing ROP and\nthose with the established disease regardless of study design. The first\nsearch was limited to literature published over the last 18 years (2005\n- 2023) since the first CPG edition. The search was based on inclusion\ncriteria and all studies were in English. In addition, the reference lists of\nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify\nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted for studies\nrelated to the issues addressed. All searches were conducted from\n8 March 2022 to 23 March 2022. The literature search was repeated\nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process\nallowing any relevant papers published before 17 March 2023 to be\nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after\nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.

Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG\nmembers met 18 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and Review Committee (RC). Where evidence was insufficient,\nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. Management of Retinopathy of Prematurity (Second Edition)\niv\nThe literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE II). On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It\nwas also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from\nany interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for CPG and the Health Technology Assessment\n(HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative disease in\nthe developing retinal vessels of premature infants. This potentially\nblinding condition is largely preventable if appropriate, adequate and\naccessible screening programme are available. However, the preexisting ROP screening protocol needs to be updated based on the\nlatest development in neonatal care. A 2019 report by the Malaysian National Neonatal Registry reviewed\nthe screening for ROP of 2,145 inborn infants at gestational age <32\nweeks who survived to six weeks of age before discharged from\nneonatal care. A total of 87.1% infants did not have ROP, 10.7% had\nROP stage 1 or 2, 1.6% stage 3 and 0.4% stage 4 or 5. The incidence\nrate of severe ROP (stage 3, 4 and 5) were 20%, 7% and 0.7% in\ninfants with gestational age of 22 - 24 weeks, 25 - 27 weeks and 28 -\n31 weeks respectively. A total of 38 infants had laser therapy and one\ninfant underwent cryotherapy.1, level III\nThe first local edition of the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the\nmanagement of ROP was published in 2005. With the advances\nin research and technology, there is a great shift in the paradigm of\nclassification and treatment of the disease. This current edition intends\nto update the recommendations in the management which includes\nInternational Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity Third Edition\n(ICROP-3) classification, intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (anti-VEGF) treatment and vitrectomy techniques. It is hoped that this latest edition of the CPG will improve the management\nof ROP and thus prevent visual impairment (VI) and blindness in the\naffected children. Management of Retinopathy of Prematurity (Second Edition)\n2. RISK FACTORS\nThere are various systemic risk factors that influence the development\nand progression of ROP. Among these, low gestational age (GA) and\nlow birth weight (BW) are the strongest and most established risk\nfactors. a. Prematurity\nGestational age is the most predictive risk factor for the development\nof ROP.2\nb. Low birth weight\nThe incidence of ROP was 68% among infants weighing <1251 g.3, level I\nc.

IDENTIFICATION AND SCREENING OF INFANTS AT RISK\n3.1 Screening Criteria\nScreening for ROP has been recommended to be carried out for infants\nwith either:2\n\u2022 BW <1500 g\n\u2022 GA <32 weeks\n\u2022 infants with an unstable clinical course who are at high risk (as\ndetermined by the neonatologist or paediatrician)\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), the screening criteria for ROP is GA <31\nweeks (up to and including 30 weeks and six days) and/or BW <1501\ng11 whereas in the United States of America (USA), the criteria is set at\nGA \u226430 weeks and/or BW \u22641500 g.12\nIn a systematic review of 18 studies on screening for ROP in premature\ninfants, the risk of ROP was 30.7% in those born at GA \u226430 weeks or\nBW \u22641500 g. The risk increased to 62.9% among those who were \u226427\nweeks of GA and/or \u2264750 g BW. The odds of developing ROP was 1.4\ntimes for every week decrease in GA and 1.8 times for every 100 g\ndecrease in BW.13, level II-2\nIn a cross-sectional study on severe ROP, 13% of infants in moderate/\nlow developed countries had BW and GA exceeding the UK screening\ncriteria.14, level III\nA prospective study using USA and UK screening criteria for ROP in\nmore mature and larger premature infants, the findings were:15, level III\n\u2022 premature infants with BW >1500 g had 34.6% ROP and 25.9%\nof them required treatment\n\u2022 25.8% of premature infants with GA >32 weeks had ROP and\n10.8% of them needed treatment\n\u2022 14.7% treatment-requiring ROP would have been missed based\non the USA screening criteria\n\u2022 9.4% with severe ROP would have been missed based on the UK\nscreening criteria\nBased on the evidence discussed above, the CPG DG has decided to\nrevise the screening criteria using the BW <1750 g and GA <34 weeks.", "chunk_order": 8}

Recommendation 2\n\u2022 First examination to detect retinopathy of prematurity should be\ndone based on post-menstrual age and post-natal age. 3.2 Counselling\nCounselling is an important component in the management of ROP. It has to be done in a safe, timely and coordinated manner to prevent\ndelays in management and alleviate uncertainties in parents\u2019/carers\u2019\nmind. These can help them in the overall care of their infants including\nregular check-ups through positive communications with the healthcare\nproviders.17, level III\nThere are a few aspects to be considered when delivering the\ncounselling to parents/carers of the infants.

Recommendation 3\n\u2022 Counselling on timely screening and treatment should be given to\nparents/carers of infants at risk and diagnosed with retinopathy of\nprematurity. 3.3 Preparation for Screening\nFor effective screening purposes, the eyes need to be fully dilated. In\nlocal clinical practice, the infants are usually kept fasted from the time of\ndilatation. Excess drops are needed to be wiped off to reduce systemic\nabsorption and side effects. a. Dilating regime\nA systematic review showed that heterogeneous combinations of\nmydriatic eye drops (cyclopentolate, tropicamide and phenylephrine)\nwere generally effective and safe to be used for ROP examination. The lowest concentration regimen to provide adequate dilatation was a\ncombination of phenylephrine 1% and cyclopentolate 0.2% (one drop\neach). Systemic absorption of mydriatics had been associated with\nclinically significant and sometimes life-threatening cardiovascular,\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal AEs.19, level I The quality of the primary\npapers was low to moderate. Management of Retinopathy of Prematurity (Second Edition)\n\u2022 Combination of Gutt cyclopentolate 0.2% and Gutt phenylephrine\n1% (e.g. Gutt cyclomydril) may be used as the preferred dilating\nregime. \u2022 Monitoring for AEs are strongly advised in the use of mydriatic eye\ndrops. Alternative\ndilating\nregimes\nand\ntheir\npharmacokinetics\nand\npharmacodynamics are shown in Appendix 4. b. Pain relief\nA meta-analysis of four RCTs found that sucrose was significantly\nmore effective than placebo to reduce pain during ROP examination\nin preterm infants. The concentration of sucrose used in these studies\nranged at 24% to 33%. However, there may be a combined effect of\ntopical anaesthesia as it was used in three of the RCTs. Apart from that,\ntopical anaesthetic eye drops alone showed mixed results in reducing\npain while non-pharmacological interventions e.g. swaddling, sucking\nand adjusting the environment (dim lighting with reduced sound and\nactivity level) did not significantly reduced pain. Overall, the quality of\nthe studies included was good.20, level I\nA large RCT demonstrated that 1 ml of oral sucrose 25% given for\ntwo minutes along with topical anaesthesia before ROP examination\nsignificantly reduced clinically-observed pain based on Neonatal Infant\nPain Scale.21, level I\n\u2022 Oral sucrose should be considered to be used with topical\nanaesthesia in retinopathy of prematurity examination.", "chunk_order": 10}

Conventional gold standard\nThe conventional screening methods for ROP is performed by the\nophthalmologist using a gold standard which is the Binocular Indirect\nOphthalmoscopy (BIO) in fully dilated eyes. Through technological\nevolution, new screening methods using imaging techniques have been\nintroduced e.g. digital retinal photography and smart phone-assisted\nimaging techniques. b. Digital retinal photography\nIn a systematic review, ROP screening by non-ophthalmologists using\ndigital retinal photography was shown to be a potentially useful tool\nto diagnose treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP) or referral-warranted\nROP compared with BIO.22, level II-2\nManagement of Retinopathy of Prematurity (Second Edition)\nA diagnostic study supported the use of wide-field digital retinal imaging\nin the diagnosis of severe and TW-ROP with 100% sensitivity and\nspecificity. However, BIO remained superior in detection of mild ROP in\nthe peripheral fundus.23, level III\nIn a cross-sectional study, wide-field digital retinal photography by\nneonatal nurses was effective for diagnosing referral-warranting ROP\nwith a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 94.5%.24, level III\nc. Telemedicine\nA multicentre diagnostic study showed that remote interpretation of\ndigital fundus images was a useful adjunct for ROP screening with BIO\nas a reference standard. The sensitivities were high at 92% for both\nclinically significant ROP and prethreshold Type I ROP.25, level III\nThe Stanford University Network for Diagnosis of ROP (SUNDROP)\nstudy on 6-year telemedicine initiative reported high diagnostic accuracy\nof retinal images done by trained nurses remotely and interpreted by a\nROP specialist in a centre. All images were compared with the gold\nstandard of BIO results by a paediatric retinal specialist. The sensitivity\nwas 100%, specificity 99.8%, positive predictive value (PPV) 95.5%\nand negative predictive value (NPV) 100% for the detection of TWROP. There were no adverse anatomical outcomes observed.26, level III\nOn the other hand, the Karnataka Internet Assisted Diagnosis of\nROP (KIDROP) tele-ROP model required trained technicians to\nidentify patients with TW-ROP and send images to the ROP expert\nfor verification. Once ROP were confirmed, the patient underwent BIO\nbefore treatment was instituted. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and\nNPV of image grading by the technician were 95.7% (95% CI 85.1 to\n99.3), 93.2% (95% CI 87.7 to 96.7), 81.5% (95% CI 68.6 to 90.7) and\n98.6% (95% CI 94.9 to 99.8) respectively.27, level III\nRecommendation 5\n\u2022 Binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (BIO) should be used for\nscreening retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and performed by the\nophthalmologist.", "chunk_order": 11}

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of ROP should be guided by evidence-based\napproach in order to provide quality care to the patients. Several factors\nmay affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 10.1\nFacilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 wide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to\nhealthcare providers and institutions\n\u2022 training and updates on the management of ROP in relevant\nscientific and professional meeting, seminar, conference etc. \u2022 Malaysian National Neonatal Registry which includes data on\nROP by MoH hospitals and Vermont Oxford Network by MoHE\nhospitals\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:\n\u2022 limited awareness and knowledge among healthcare providers on\nROP and its management\n\u2022 lack of awareness and understanding among parents/carers on\nthe importance of prematurity and risk of ROP\n\u2022 lack of expertise and facilities in diagnosing ROP and delivering\nits treatment\n10.2\nPotential Resource Implications\nAlthough ROP is uncommon, it is a treatable condition. Early\nidentification is crucial as early treatment will provide favourable visual\noutcomes including prevention of blindness. Screening on preterm infants at risk of ROP is strongly advocated. Trained\nophthalmologists,\nother\nhealthcare\nprofessionals\n(neonatologists/paediatricians) and nurses are required in the screening.", "chunk_order": 25}

BIO is currently the gold standard method of screening, however there\nis emerging evidence on the potential use of digital imaging techniques\nand telemedicine which require financial and infrastructural support. Regular screening is essential until the retina has matured and no\ncomplications developed. The main options for treatment of ROP is laser photocoagulation\nand anti-VEGF. The latter requires skilled ophthalmologist and the\navailability of the medications. Apart from that, patient may need to be\nreferred to a secondary or tertiary centre for further treatment.

Solid circles\nrepresent borders of zones I through III, and dotted circles represent\nborders of posterior zone II (2 disc diameters beyond zone I). An example of examination findings is shown in LE, representing\napproximately 3 clock hours of stage 1 disease in zone II (note single\nline on drawing to document presence of stage 1 disease). The description of the zones for classification of ROP are as follows:\n\u2022 Zone I extends from the optic disc to a point double the distance\nfrom the disc to the fovea, a radius of 30\u02da. \u2022 Zone II is a circle surrounding the zone I circle with the nasal ora\nserrata as its nasal border. \u2022 Zone III is the residual crescent anterior to zone II. a. Definition of 3 retinal zones centred on\nthe optic disc. The location of the most\nposterior retinal vascularisation or ROP\nlesion denotes the zone for the eye. b. Definition of a posterior zone II region\nthat begins at the margin between zone I\nand zone II and extends into zone II for 2\ndisc diameters.*\nc. The term notch is used to describe an\nincursion by the ROP lesion of 1 - 2 clock\nhours into a more posterior zone. The\n1. Zone (additional\ndescription)\nManagement of Retinopathy of Prematurity (Second Edition)\nROP zone for such eyes should be noted\nby the most posterior zone of retinal\nvascularisation with the qualifier \u201cnotch\u201d\n(e.g., \u201czone I secondary to notch\u201d).*\n1. Plus and Preplus Disease\nPlus disease is defined by the appearance\nof dilation and tortuosity of retinal vessels,\nand\nPre-plus disease is defined by abnormal\nvascular dilation, tortuosity insufficient for\nplus disease, or both. Recognition that retinal vascular changes\nin ROP represent a continuous spectrum\nfrom normal to pre-plus to plus disease,\nwith sample images demonstrating this\nrange.* These changes should be assessed\nby vessels within zone I, rather than from\nonly vessels within the field of narrowangle photographs and rather than from the\nnumber of quadrants of abnormality.*\n2.", "chunk_order": 34}
