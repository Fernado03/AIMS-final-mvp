These guidelines are based on the\nfindings of health technology assessment on the same topic, as well as a systematic\nreview of current medical literature, taking into consideration local medical practice and\nlocal microbiology patterns and trends of antimicrobial resistance. The ranking of\nevidence is based on a modified version of that suggested by the Catalonia Agency for\nHealth Technology Assessment and Research (CAHTAR) Spain, while the grading of\nrecommendations in these guidelines emulates those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate\nGuidelines Network (SIGN). The draft guidelines were posted on both the Ministry of\nHealth Malaysia and Academy of Medicine, Malaysia websites for comment and\nfeedback. These guidelines have also been presented to the Technical Advisory\nCommittee for Clinical Practice Guidelines and Health Technology Assessment and\nClinical Practice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and\napproval. Objectives\nThe aim of this guideline is to aid doctors in general practice and pediatricians in clinical\ndecision making by providing well-balanced evidence based information on the rational\nutilisation of antibiotics in selected paediatric conditions. Clinical Questions\nThe clinical questions for these guidelines are:\n(i)\nWhich are the situations in selected paediatric conditions where antibiotic\nuse should be considered? (ii)\nWhich are the antibiotics recommended to be used in selected paediatric\nconditions? Target Population\nThese guidelines are applicable to paediatric patients with specific conditions. Target Group\nThese guidelines are meant for all health care providers who provide clinical\nmanagement of children. General Principles of Antibiotics Administration\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nFebrile neutropenia is a common consequence of anticancer chemotherapy, fever being\ndefined as a single oral temperature of more than or equal to 38.3\u00b0C with a neutrophil\ncount of less than 500 cells/mm3 (Hughes et al, 1997, level 2). Cancer patients receiving\nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy develop severe neutropenia and are at a high risk of\ndeveloping life-threatening infections (Charnas, Luthi & Ruch, 1997, level 1; Cometta et\nal, 1996). Bacterial infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in\nneutropenic cancer patients (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997, level 9), with a microbiologic cause\nfor the febrile episode being demonstrated in approximately 40% cases (Charnas, Luthi &\nRuch, 1997, level 1). These patients are at risk of endogenous flora, especially aerobic\nGram-negative bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract and also those pathogens\ncolonizing on normal or damaged mucosa or skin surfaces, like Gram-negative bacilli\n(Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) or Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus\naureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and viridans streptococci) (Charnas, Luthi & Ruch,\n1997, level 1; Patrick, 1997). Since febrile neutropenic patients fail to mount a full inflammatory response, and the\ncurrent diagnostic tests are not sufficiently rapid, sensitive or specific for identifying or\nexcluding the microbial cause of a febrile episode, these patients may have to be treated\nempirically. The risk of infection increases ten-fold with declining neutrophil counts. It\nhas been shown that with absolute neutrophil counts between 100 and 500/mm3,\ninfection rates rise from 0.5 to 5 infections per 100 days, while 16 - 20% of patients with\nneutrophil counts less than 100/mm3 have bacteremia (Hughes et al, 1997, level 1). The\nprompt institution of empiric antibiotic therapy for febrile neutropenic patients, without\nwaiting 24 to 48 hours for the results of blood cultures, has been shown to dramatically\nreduce infection-related morbidity and mortality in the cancer population undergoing\nchemotherapy (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997, level 9). Empiric antibiotic therapy has become a\nstandard of care for the febrile neutropenic patient. Numerous clinical trials have\ndemonstrated that any one of a number of empiric antibiotic regimens may preserve the\npatient through the critical time of fever and neutropenia, including a variety of antibiotic\ncombinations and more recently potent antibiotic monotherapies (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997,\nlevel 9). Consequently, there is universal agreement in the literature that broad spectrum\nantibiotics should be instituted for all cases of febrile neutropenia because of the\nsignificant morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial sepsis in patients with fever\nand cancer (Freifeld & Pizzo, 1997, level 9 ). 2.

RECOMMENDATIONS\ni. Empirical broad spectrum antibiotics, covering both gram-positive and gram-\nnegative pathogens, should be commenced for all febrile neutropenic patients\n[ Grade A].The choice of initial empirical antibiotics, however, remains\ncontroversial (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Mustafa et al, 2001,\nlevel 3; Duzova et al, 2001, level 3; Fleischack et al, 2001, level 2; Kebudi et al,\n2001, level 3; Furno et al, 2000, level 2; Petrilli et al, 2000, level 3). Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions\nii. Monotherapy with third-generation cephalosporins such as Ceftazidime (Ministry\nof Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Kebudi et al, 2001, level 3) and Ceftriaxone\n(Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Karthaus et al, 1998, level 3) or\nfourth-generation cephalosporins such as Cefepime (Ministry of Health Malaysia,\n2003, level 1;Mustafa et al, 2001, level 3), or Imipenem (Raad et al, 1998, level 9)\nand Meropenem (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Duzova et al, 2001,\nlevel 3) are equally efficacious and safe compared to combination chemotherapy\nwith antipseudomonal beta-lactams and aminoglycosides [Grade A ]\niii. Instead of monotherapy, combination therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic and an\naminoglycoside can also be initiated, like combinations of Ceftazidime and\nAmikacin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Hughes et al, 1997, level\n2), Ceftriaxone and Amikacin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level\n1;Charnas, Luthi & Ruch, 1997, level 1) and Piperacillin and Amikacin (Ministry\nof Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Hughes et al, 1997, level 2 ) [Grade A ] . iv. In centers where Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcal areus(MRSA) is prevalent,\nVancomycin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Hughes et al, 1997,\nlevel 2) may be considered in addition to broad gram-negative coverage with third\ngeneration\ncephalosporins\nsuch\nas\nCeftazidime,\nor\nfourth-generation\ncephalosporins such as Cefepime [Grade C]. . v.

INTRODUCTION\nCommunity acquired pneumonia may be defined as the presence of clinical signs and\nsymptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child due to an infection acquired\noutside the hospital (British Thoracic Society, 2002). However, definitive information\nabout causative organisms is seldom available at clinical presentation (McCracken, 2000),\nand current diagnostic techniques are not sufficiently sensitive to detect all relevant\npathogens. . 2. AETIOLOGY\nA causative pathogen is identified in 43% - 85% of community acquired pneumonias in\nchildhood (Wubbel et al, 1999, level 3; Juven et al, 2000; level 8), with a significant\nproportion (8% - 40%) being mixed infections. Studies have shown prevalence of\nparticular pathogens at specific age groups as indicated below:\n2.1\nBacterial Aetiological Agents\nStreptococcus pneumoniae while being the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia\nin children under 2 years (Drummond et al, 2000, level 8), remains an important\norganism in the aetiology of community acquired pneumonias in children of all ages. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae become more prevalent with\nincreasing age from above 5 years (Heiskanen-Kosma et al, 1998, level 5;Wubbel et al,\n1999, level 3). 2.2\nViral Aetiological Agents\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the commonest cause of lower respiratory infections\nin infants and younger children (Sonoda et al, 1999, level 5; Videla et al, 1998, level 8;\nHijazi et al, 1997, level 8), while other viruses are Parainfluenza, Influenza, Adenovirus\n(Juven et al, 2000, level 8;; Chan et al, 1999). 3. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION\n3.1\nClinical Diagnosis\nViral and bacterial pneumonia cannot be distinguished on clinical features alone.", "chunk_order": 6}

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION\n3.1\nClinical Diagnosis\nViral and bacterial pneumonia cannot be distinguished on clinical features alone. However, clinical signs such as tachypnoea (defined by WHO\u2019s ARI case management\nguideline as respiratory rate > 60/min.in infants under 2 months, > 50/min in infants 2 \u2013\n12 months and > 40/min for children more than 12 months) is a useful sign, where the\nseverity of the tachypnoea relates to the severity of the illness. In children older than 3\nyears, pneumonia can occur even in the absence of tachypnoea. Fever is an important clinical sign. A young child with mild symptoms and low grade\ntemperature is most likely to have a viral infection, whereas, high fever of more than\n39\u00b0C with a history of rapid onset, with signs and symptoms of respiratory distress is\nsuggestive of pneumonia of bacterial origin. Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions\nWheezing is likely to be associated with viral lower respiratory infection in younger\nchildren. However, when wheezing is present in older school-going children associated\nwith fever, headache, arthralgia and cough, mycoplasma infection has to be considered. While auscultatory findings are not useful in differentiating viral from bacterial causes,\nthe presence of staphylococcal skin infections or history of contact may point to the\nprobable cause causative agent. 3.2\nLaboratory Diagnosis\nLaboratory investigations to establish the aetiological agent are not indicated in children\nwith community acquired pneumonias well enough to receive ambulatory treatment. However, in children with pneumonias requiring inpatient treatment, investigations to\nidentify the probable aetiological agents should be carried out:\ni. Culture of lung aspirate/pleural fluids, nasopharyngeal secretions and blood\nsample. Invasive procedures like biopsy or needle aspirate of lung tissues are\nrarely carried out in children with acute pneumonias. Where significant pleural\neffusion is present, the pleural fluid is aspirated for culture, direct microscopic\nexamination and antigen detection. Nasopharyngeal bacterial secretions correlate\npoorly while viral culture is time consuming. Blood culture should be done for\nany ill child with pneumonia, for which most studies report not more than 10%\npositive results. ii. Rapid antigen identification for viral pathogens especially RSV should be\ncarried out for young infants with lower respiratory tract infections. iii. Serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumonie, if available, may be\nconsidered to assist in the management of suspected cases. 4.", "chunk_order": 7}

MANAGEMENT\nPneumonia in young children with mild symptoms of lower respiratory infections are\nlikely to be viral in aetiology and hence antibiotics need not be used [Grade B ]\n4.1\nEmpirical Treatment\nChildren of all age groups who are toxic, febrile (temperature >39\u00b0C) and with\nrespiratory distress (tachypnoea or difficulty in breathing) are most likely to have\nbacterial pneumonias that warrant empirical antibiotic therapy. For ambulatory treatment, oral Amoxicillin is recommended for children aged 5 years or\nbelow, and Macrolides for older children and adolescents (Ministry of Health Malaysia,\n2003, level 1;Grant & Ingram, 2000, level 9) [Grade B ]\nFor hospitalized patients, Penicillin, Macrolides or Cefuroxime plus Macrolides are\nrecommended (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Ruskanen & Mertsole, 1999,\nlevel 9). In ill young patients where Staphylococcus pneumonia is suspected, intravenous\nCloxacillin or Flucloxacillin should be added ( Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;\nStraus et al, 1998, level 1) [Grade A]\nRational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions\n4.2\nSpecific Treatment\nSpecific therapy can be instituted if the causative organism is identified by culture or\nantigen detection. a) Pneumonia due to Pneumococcus, Group A Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae b\n- Amoxycillin-Clavulanate , Amoxycillin, Penicillin G or Cefuroxime ( Ministry\nof Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Olivier, 2000, level 9; Wubbel et al, 1999, level 1;\nGrimwood et al, 1997, level 9) [Grade B]\nb) Pneumonia due to penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae\n- No significant difference in response to conventional antibiotic regimes\n( Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Tan et al, 1998, level 8)\nc) Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae\n- Macrolides is recommended as empirical antimicrobial treatment in children 5\nyears and above.

Clinicians who assess children with\naseptic meningitis recognize that the majority of cases are caused by viruses but are often\nfaced with having to exclude partially treated bacterial meningitis in children who had\nbeen on oral antibiotics. 1.1\nBacterial meningitis\nBacterial meningitis in children between 2 months to 12 years of age in Malaysia is\nusually due to Haemophilus influenza type B Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria\nmeningitides (Limcangco et al, 2000, level 8; Uduman et al, 2000, level 8; Lee, 1998,\nlevel 8; Hussein et al, 1998, level 8; Almuneef et al, 1998, level 8) If there are alterations\nof host defense mechanisms there is an increased risk of meningitis from less common\npathogens such as Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus\nepidermidis, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. 2. EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIBIOTIC USE\n2.1\nHaemophilus Influenza type b Meningitis\nLocal data from the 1970\u2019s through mid 1990\u2019s have revealed Haemophilus influenza\ntype b as the leading pathogen in childhood bacterial meningitis (Ministry of Health\nMalaysia, 2003, level 1; Hussein et al, 1998; level 8; Choo et al, 1990; level 8). Antibiotics like Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol all cross the\nblood brain barrier during acute inflammation in concentrations adequate to render them\neffective. Recent reviews from Taiwan (Ma et al, 2000; level 7), USA (Dawson et al 1999, level 7),\nCanada (Gold, 1999, level 7), Greece (Syriopoulou et al, 2000, level 7) and Italy (Principi,\n2000, level 7) have reported a marked decline in the incidence of Haemophilus influenza\nmeningitis following the success of the conjugate HIB vaccines. 2.2\nStreptococcus pneumoniae Meningitis\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in USA, Canada\nand several European countries. Historically, penicillin, a cheap and safe antibiotic , has\nbeen the treatment of choice. Chloramphenicol monotherapy has been used in the past but\ntreatment failures have been reported (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Jadavji,\n1986, level 6)\nRational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions\n2.3\nPenicillin Resistant Streptococcus Pneumoniae Meningitis\nThe incidence of reported Penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (not\nexclusive to meningitis alone) from various countries are 1% in Taiwan, 10.2% in Italy,\n11% in Sweden, 12.7% in USA, and 13% in Canada in 1998. In Malaysia there has been\nan increase from 2.4% to 7% in 1978-1988 to 8% in 1995 - 1996 (Ministry of Health\nMalaysia, 2003, level 1; Ma et al, 2000, level 7, Principi, 2000, level 7; Eriksson et al,\n2000, level 7; Moshe Arditi et al, 1998, level 5; Scheifele et al, 2000, level 7).", "chunk_order": 11}

In response to the increasing trend of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, both\nthe American Academy of Paediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society have\nrecommended empirical antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis, comprising a\ncombination of IV Vancomycin plus either IV Cefotaxime or Ceftriaxone for all children\n1 month or more in age with probable or definite meningitis (Ministry of Health Malaysia,\n2003, level 1; Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Canadian Paediatric\nSociety 2001, level 4). The third generation cephalosporins such as Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime are the next\nantibiotic of choice, with approximately 50% penicillin resistant Streptococcus\npneumoniae being also resistant to both Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime (Ministry of Health\nMalaysia, 2003, level 1; Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Canadian\nPaediatric Society, 2001, level 4). New vaccination strategies against pneumococcus are being developed, but are facing\ndifficulties due to the significant variation in the population of isolates. A 23 valent\nvaccine has been available since the 1980s but provokes less antibody response in\nchildren less than 2 years (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Scheifele, 2000,\nlevel 7). 2.4\nNeisseria Meningitides Meningitis\nNeisseria meningitides serogroup A, B and C are the causative organisms for meningitis. While N. meningitides meningitis is not common in Malaysia, occasionally children may\nbe at risk of exposure from their relatives who have returned after performing the Haj. Intravenous Penicillin remains the drug of choice. Chloramphenicol still provides\neffective treatment for patients who are allergic to Penicillin. In 2000, it was reported that\nthere were 38 cases of serogroup W135 Neisseria meningitides in England and Wales, of\nwhom 80% that had died had received serogroup C vaccine previously (Ministry of\nHealth Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Bolt et al 2001 level 8). This has highlighted the need for\ncontinuing epidemiological vigilance. The quadrivalent A, C, Y, W 135 is replacing the\npreviously bivalent vaccine. 3. ADJUVANT DEXAMETHASONE ADMINISTRATION IN BACTERIAL\nMENINGITIS. Dexamethasone reduces the inflammatory response in CSF in bacterial meningitis, but\nalso reduces the penetration of antibiotics, especially Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, into\nthe CSF. A meta-analysis supports the use of Dexamethasone only for Haemophilus\ninfluenza meningitis whether administered before or after antibiotic treatment (Ministry\nof Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; McIntyre et al, 1997, level 1). While those receiving\nRational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions\nDexamethasone had less hearing deficit episodes, this was of no benefit in reducing the\nincidences of neurological deficits. A similar finding has been reported for Streptococcus\npneumoniae meningitis (Moshe et al, 1998, level 7). There is no evidence to support\nDexamethasone use for Neisseria meningitis (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;\nMcIntyre et al, 1997, level 1). 4.", "chunk_order": 12}

INVESTIGATIONS\nRapid identification of the causative agents in septicaemia is crucial for selecting\nappropriate antimicrobial agents. It has been suggested that Fluorescent in-situ\nhybridization (FISH) with ribosomal RNA targeted fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide\nprobes be used for the rapid detection and identification of pathogens, without cultivation\nand biotyping (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Kempf & Volkhard, 2000,\nlevel 9). 3. MANAGEMENT\nWith respect to management, apart from antibiotic administration, supportive strategies\nare essential to optimize outcome. 3.1\nCommunity Acquired Bacterial Sepsis in Previously Healthy Children\n(i)\nSepsis with no obvious source or with respiratory or urinary tract infection, or\ncentral nervous system involvement\nThough the commonly used antibiotics are cloxacillin/penicillin and a third\ngeneration cephalosporin/gentamycin, no evidence could be obtained related to their\nuse (Grade C). (ii)\nSepsis with genito-urinary or gastrointestinal tract involvement\nThe commonly used antibiotics are a third generation cephalosporin or gentamycin\nwith metronidazole for intra-abdominal infections, but again no evidence could be\nobtained related to their use (Grade C). 3.2\nNosocomial Sepsis\nThere are multiple causative agents that cause nosocomial sepsis in children. It is\ntherefore recommended that the use of antibiotics be dependent on the causative agents. 3.3\nAdjuvant therapy\nIt has been found that Polyclonal Intravenous Immunoglobulin significantly reduces\nmortality and can be used as adjuvant treatment for sepsis and septic shock, but the\nnumber of patients involved in this study was small ( Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003,\nlevel 1, Alejandria et al, 2001, level 1).

INTRODUCTION\nNeonates, especially premature babies, are predisposed to infection as they are deficient\nin host defences and are at risk of acquiring infections from mothers during the perinatal\nperiod (Anwer et al, 2000, level 8). In order to rationalise the use of antibiotics,\ncontinuous surveillance is recommended with emphasis on primary prevention and\nprevention of cross infection (Musoke, 1997, level 9). 2. CLINICAL PRESENTATION\nEarly clinical presentation of sepsis in newborn includes hypothermia, hyperthermia,\npoor feeding, poor weight gain, lethargy, hypotonia, pallor, mottled skin, irritability,\njaundice, vomiting, ileus, pseudoparalysis, apnea, tachypnoea, cardiovascular signs,\nhemorrhagic diasthesis and sclerema. Late signs are usually specific to a single organ\nsystem. Septicemic shock and death often occur within 12 hours of the first sign of illness\n(Anwer et al, 2000, level 8). 3. DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATIONS\nEarly diagnosis and therapy initiated on the basis of clinical suspicion is important. Criteria for treatment could be defined by limited predictors or parameters as follows:\n1. Maternal fever, chorioamniotis, initial neonatal examination and absolute count. (Escobar, Li & Armstrong , 2000, level 5)\n2. Abnormal immature to total neutrophil ratio (I: T), followed by an abnormal\nimmature to mature neutrophil (I: M) ratio, thrombocytopenia (Ghosh, Mittal &\nJaganathan, 2001, level 9). While blood culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of sepsis (Aggarwal et al, 2001,\nlevel 9), rapid identification systems help in the early identification of neonatal\nbacteraemia (within 24- 30 hours) (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Pauli et al,\n1999, level 9). Other investigations found to be useful are:\n\u2666 C-reactive protein (CRP) (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Dollner,\nVatten & Austgulen , 2001, level 9; Icagasloglu et al, 2002).", "chunk_order": 16}

MANAGEMENT\nThe appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of infections in neonates would vary from\ncentre to centre as would the organisms causing the various infections (Chang Chien et al,\nRational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions\n2000, level 9). Hence, local data on aetiology of sepsis and the sensitivity of the\norganisms need to be reviewed. Group B streptococcus was the major pathogen of early onset septicemia (Ministry of\nHealth Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Berger et al, 1998, level 9; Luck et al, 2003, level 9;\nMehr et al, 2002, level 9; Yurdakok, 1998, Ronnestad et al, 1998, level 9). Penicillin is\nthe drug of choice for group B Streptococcus infections (Ministry of Health Malaysia,\n2003, level 1; Lin et al, 2000, level 9;Aitmhand & Moustaoui, 2000, level 9). Other\norganisms implicated in early onset sepsis are Enterobactericaea and Listeria, (Yurdakok,,\n1998), E. coli (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level ; Kuruvilla et al 1998, level 9;\nRonnestad et al 1998, level 9), Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), anaerobic\nbacteria(Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Ronnestad et al, 1998, level 9),\nKlebsiella species, Enterococcus (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Anwer et al,\n2000, level 8). Empiric therapy for neonates who develop sepsis beyond the first day of life must cover\nGram positive organisms like Staph. aureus (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;\nKarunasekara & Pathirana, 1999, level 8; Ronnestad et al 1998, level 9; Yurdakok, 1998;\nAnwer et al, 2000, level 8), Coagulase negative staphylococcus (Ministry of Health\nMalaysia, 2003, level 1; Ho, 2001, level 9; Berger et al, 1998, level 9; Mehr et al, 2002,\nlevel 9); S. epidermidis (Anwer et al, 2000, level 8) For Staphylococcus, penicillinase\nresistant penicillin e.g. Oxacillin, Nafcillin and Methicillin and for resistant strains of\nStaphylococcus, Vancomycin is recommended (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level\n1;Yurdakok, 1998, Ronnestad et al, 1998, level 9).", "chunk_order": 17}

Enterococci must also be covered\n(Yurdakok, 1998, Kuruvillla et al, 1998), with Ampicillin and Gentamicin for sensitive\nstrains and Vancomycin for Gentamicin resistant strains (Ministry of Health Malaysia,\n2003, level 1; Bhat, Paul & Bhat, 1997, level 9; Yurdakok, 1998). Therapy must also cover Gram negative organisms like Klebsiella (Karunasekara &\nBuescher, 1999, Kuruvillla et al, 1998, Ho, 2001), using Imipenem which is a good drug\nfor neonatal Klebsiella pneumonia (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Oral,\nAkisu & Kultursay 1998, level 9; Roilides & Kyriakides, 2000, level 9), and Ciprofloxcin\nas an alternative in multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (Ministry of Health\nMalaysia, 2003, level 1; Khaneja & Naprawa, 1999, level 9; Roilides & Kyriakides, 2000,\nlevel 9). Other combinations include Cefotaxime or Ceftazidime and Ampicillin\n(Akindele & Rotilu 1997, level 9), Ciprofloxacillin and Gentamicin (Ministry of Health\nMalaysia, 2003, level 1; Khaneja & Naprawa, 1999, level 9), aminoglycoside and a third\ngeneration cephalosporin such as Cefotaxime (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level\n1,), and Imipenem or Ciprofloxacin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Roilides\n& Kyriakides, 2000, level 9). For Pseudomonas. sp. (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Karlowicz, Buescher\n& Surlear, 2000, level 5; Yurdakok, 1998) especially in fulminant sepsis, treatment with\nPiperacillin and Azlocillin, Cefoperazone and Ceftazidime were the most active against\nPseudomonas (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1;Yurdakok, 1998). Treatment\nfor E. coli is also important (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Ronnestad et al,\n1998, level 9). Rational Antibiotic Utilisation in Selected Paediatric Conditions\nThere has generally been an increase in the resistance of gram-negative bacteria to\nCephalosporins and Gentamicin (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2003, level 1; Joshi et al\n2000, level 9).", "chunk_order": 18}
