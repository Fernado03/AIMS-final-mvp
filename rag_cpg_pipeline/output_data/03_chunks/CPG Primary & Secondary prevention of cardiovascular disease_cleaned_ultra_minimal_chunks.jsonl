Specific attempts were made to use local data and\npublications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline does not\nnecessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care as this\ndepends on other clinical factors like co-morbidities, acceptance of patients towards\nrecommended therapy etc. Every health care provider is responsible to individualise\nthe management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation and\nmanagement options available locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline is issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in 2022 or earlier if important\nnew evidence becomes available. CPG Secretariat\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia\nAvailable on the following websites:\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadmed.org.my\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nCardiovascular Diseases (CVD) has been the leading\ncause of death in Malaysian since the early 1980s. The\nNational Burden of Disease Study in early 2000s showed\nthat coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular\ndisease (CVA) are the top two causes of death for both\nmen and women. What is of concern is that the age of\nonset of CVD in Malaysia is younger compared to\nour neighbors and some western nations. Equally of concern is that the incidence of the major risk factors contributing to CVD\nhas shown an increasing trend over the last 3 decades. The Ministry of Health\n(MOH) in conjunction with the Academy of Medicine and Professional Non-Governmental Organisations had since the mid-1990s had published Clinical Practice\nGuidelines (CPGs) on the Management of major risk factors for CVD. This is\nfollowed by CPGs on the Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure\nand Cerebrovascular Accidents. More recently, in 2010, the MOH launched the\nNational Strategic Plan for Non-Communicable Disease (NSP-NCD) in response to\nthe global challenge in combatting NCD in general and CVD in particular. This\ndocument is now being updated by the MOH to reflect latest developments in the\nfield and more current global targets set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). What has been missing thus far is an integrated approach to combat CVD at both\nthe primary and secondary prevention levels. This is where this pioneering CPG on\nPrevention of CVD is a most welcome addition to compliment earlier initiatives to\nconfront the scourge of CVD. The integrated approach adopted in this CPG engaging a wide spectrum of health care professionals (from dieticians to clinicians) is\nmost commendable. It is my wish that this CPG is widely available and adopted by\nall health care professionals involved in the management of CVD.", "chunk_order": 0}

The National Cardiovascular Disease \u2013 Acute Coronary Syndrome\n(NCVD-ACS) Registry has also shown that Malaysians are developing heart disease\nat a younger age than that seen in the neighbouring countries. This Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease, 1ST Edition, is timely. It is directed at both individuals with and without\nestablished CVD. It has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National\nHeart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy of\nMedicine. It comprises of cardiologists, endocrinologists, general and family\nphysicians and physicians from the MOH, Public Health Division, government and\nprivate hospitals and the universities. Objectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to:\n\u2022\nLook critically at the available evidence on the effectiveness of strategies for\nthe primary and secondary prevention of CVD. \u2022\nEducate healthcare workers on methods of assessing and stratifying CV risk in\nour local population. \u2022\nSuggest appropriate preventive steps against CVD at the individual, community\nand governmental level. Process:\nA review of current medical literature on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention for the\nlast 10 years was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases \u2013 PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews.The\nsearch was conducted for the period January 2006 till 31st August 2016.

The relevant articles were carefully selected from\nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were\nsearched to identify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the\nfield were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines\nmainly that from the American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology\n(AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main\nreferences.

Clinical Questions Addressed:\n\u2022\nHow common are the CV risk factors in Malaysia? \u2022\nHow cost effective is CVD prevention? \u2022\nWhat are the types of CVD one should target for prevention? \uf0d8 What are the risk factors? \uf0d8 Are there any other conditions/risk markers beyond the traditional risk\nfactors? \u2022\nHow do you assess CV risk for:\n\uf0d8 Primary prevention? \uf0d8 Secondary prevention? \u2022\nWhat steps should be taken to prevent CV risk at the:\n\uf0d8 Individual level? \uf0d8 Community, population and governmental level? Target Group:\nThese guidelines are directed at all healthcare providers \u2013 all medical practitioners,\nallied health personnel, traditional and complementary medicine practitioners. Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nTarget Population:\nThese guidelines are developed to prevent CVD (heart disease and strokes) in all\nindividuals. Period of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with\nrecent developments and knowledge regarding preventive strategies against CVD. Implementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical\ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\u2022\nIncreasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the\nimportance of knowing their individual CV risk. \u2022\nContinuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on CV risk\nassessment tools and the implementation of appropriate preventative\nstrategies depending on each individual\u2019s CV risk status. This can be done by\nroad shows, electronic media, in-house training sessions. \u2022\nPerformance measures that include:\n\uf0d8 Achieving of NCD Targets (Section 14, pg 133)\n\uf0d8 Hospital admissions and discharges\n\uf0d8 Periodic national health surveys\n\uf0d8 Mortality statistics\n\uf0d8 Burden of disease studies conducted every 10 years\nFacilitators, Barriers and Resource Implications\nIn the prevention of CVD, the emphasis is on lifestyle measures and the use of\nmedications that are already available in the hospitals of the Ministry of Health. It\nhowever entails:\n\u2022\nEducation of the healthcare providers on:\n\uf0d8 What constitutes a healthy diet\n\uf0d8 How to teach simple practical exercises that even a busy/elderly person\ncan perform.

Introduction\n1.1\nEpidemiology of Cardiovascular Disease\nCVD is the main cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disease related\ndisability.1,2 In Malaysia, CVD has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality\nfor more than a decade.1\u20135\nThere is limited data on the exact prevalence of CVD locally. The data available is\nfrom the NCVD-ACS Registry. This is a voluntary registry of patients admitted with\nACS to public and private hospitals. Data from the 2011-2013 registry indicated that\nMalaysians developed ACS at a younger age than that seen in neighbouring\ncountries.6 The mean age was 58.5 years and the peak incidence was in the 51-60\nyear age group.6 This is younger than that noted in Thailand (63.5 years)7 and\nSingapore (median: 68.3-69.2 years).8\n1.2\nPrevalance of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Malaysia\nThere is more representative information on the prevalence of CV risk factors locally\nfrom the National Health and Morbidity Surveys (NHMS). The Malaysian adult population (\u226518 years) has high levels of CV risk factors. \u2022\n63.6% of men, and 64.5% of women are either overweight or obese.9\n\u2022\n43% of men smoke,9 59% of men between the ages 21-30 smoke.10\n\u2022\n43.5% of men, and 52.2% of women have hypercholesterolemia.9\n\u2022\n30.8% of men, and 29.7% of women have hypertension.9\n\u2022\n16.7% of men, and 18.3% of women have diabetes mellitus.9\nData from NHMS V 2015 showed that the prevalence of these CV risk factors begin\nto increase from the age of 30 years.9 (Table 7, pg 28)\nThe projected adult population (\u226518 years of age) in this country for 2016, stands at\n21.5 million, with 11 million men and 10.5 million women.", "chunk_order": 13}

Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\n\u2022\n6.5 million adults have hypertension; 3.4 million men and 3.1 million women. \u2022\n4.8 million men smoke. \u2022\n3.8 million adults have diabetes mellitus; 1.8 million men and 1.9 million women. Clustering of these five CV risk factors is common, occurring in almost half of\nMalaysian adults:\n\u2022\n43.2% had at least 2 of the risk factors stated above.11\n\u2022\n47% of those \u226530 years were at increased CV risk;12 based on the FRS;\n\uf0d8 26.7% were at high CV risk. \uf0d8 20.3% were at intermediate CV risk. In the INTERHEART study, these 5 modifiable risk factors (abnormal lipids,\nhypertension, current smoking, diabetes and abdominal obesity) contributed to\nabout 80% of myocardial infarcts (MI).13 Smoking and abnormal lipids accounted for\n2/3 of the MIs in this study.13\n1.3\nImpact of Reducing/ Modifying CV Risk Factors\nDiet and lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol\nconsumption, may contribute by as much as 70% towards the development of other\nCV risk factors such as abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes and\nhypercholesterolemia.14\u201317 Together they contribute to more than 95% of acute\ncoronary events.18\nA decrease in these CV risk factors has been shown to reduce CV morbidity and\nmortality in both people without (primary prevention) and with established CVD\n(secondary prevention).19\nMortality risk reductions can be as large as 15-50% in the general population and by\n20-45% in those with CVD.20 This magnitude is more than the mortality risk\nreductions (range 18-26%) seen in the secondary prevention drug interventional\ntrials.20\nReductions in CV mortality can be achieved with reductions in CV risk factor levels\nand improved treatment strategies. In Scotland, there was a 30% reduction in CV\nmortality between 1975 \u20131994,21 and in England and Wales, reductions in CV risk\nfactors accounted for 79% of life years gained over 20 years.22 In Finland, mortality\ndue to CHD decreased by 82% in men and 84% in women between the years\n1969-1972 and 2012.23,24\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nReductions in the 3 major CV risk factors \u2013 smoking, high cholesterol and high BP\naccounted for almost all of the observed CHD mortality reduction during the first 10\nyears\nof\nthe\nstudy\nand\nabout\n69%\nin\nmen\nand\n66%\nin\nwomen in the last 10 years.24\nIt was estimated that there would be over 5000 fewer deaths per year in the UK if the\ntotal cholesterol was reduced by 1 mmol/L, the smoking prevalence was reduced\nfrom 30% to 18% and there was a 3.2 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP.25\nTo tackle the CV epidemic in this country, dietary and lifestyle changes in the general\npopulation have to be emphasized.", "chunk_order": 14}

In addition, there appears to be a familial predisposition to CVD. The presence of CVD (CHD and stroke) in first degree relatives (parent or sibling)\nbefore 55 years in men and 65 years in women is an independent risk factor for\nfuture CVD.52\u201356 This risk is increased:\n\u2022\nWhen the affected individual is a first-degree relative. \u2022\nWith the higher number of family members with CVD. \u2022\nWith the younger the age at which family members develop CVD. \u2022\nIf the affected individual is an identical twin. \u2022\nIf there is a maternal history of MI than a paternal history of MI.57,58\n\u2022\nWhen there is a history of MI in second degree relatives.59\n\u2022\nIf there is a parental history of premature stroke.60,61\nDespite earlier referral and treatment of individuals with a positive family history of\npremature CVD, the excess risk still persists.62\n5.1.4 Ethnicity\nSouth Asians (Indians) have a higher prevalence of CHD and CV mortality compared\nwith Europeans.63 East Asians (Chinese and Japanese) exhibit consistently higher\nrates of stroke.64,65\nWhile conventional CV risk factors such as smoking, BP and total cholesterol predict\nrisk within these ethnic groups, they do not fully account for the differences in risk\nbetween ethnic groups, suggesting that alternative explanations might exist.66\n5.2\nModifiable CV Risk Factors\nIn 2010, CVD, diabetes and CKD accounted for 33 % of all deaths world-wide.67 The\n4 modifiable CV risk factors \u2013 hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, raised blood\nglucose and high BMI \u2013 together accounted for 63% of these deaths.67 Data from the\nUnited States showed that in persons >35 years of age, smoking alone accounted\nfor 33 percent of all deaths from CVD and 20 percent of deaths from ischemic heart\ndisease.40 Even among individuals at high genetic risk, a favorable lifestyle was\nassociated with a 46% lower relative risk of CV events than an unfavorable\nlifestyle.68\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\n5.2.1\nDiet/Dietary Patterns\nDiet plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic diseases such as\nobesity, diabetes and CVD.

Interventions to Prevent CVD\n8.1 Nutrition\nDietary habits influence a variety of cardio-metabolic risk factors such as body\nweight, cholesterol, BP, glucose metabolism, oxidative stress and\ninflammation.316,317 It is being increasingly recognized that instead of focussing\non specific nutrients, it is more important to look at specific foods and overall\ndietary patterns.316,317\nGeneral recommendations should fit in with the local culture. Energy intake\nshould be adjusted to avoid overweight/obesity. 8.1.1 Nutritional Composition of Food\nThe recommended nutrition intake (RNI) by the National Coordinating\nCommittee on Food and Nutrition Malaysia (NCCFN) 2017,318 states that the\ntotal daily calorie intake should consist of:\n\u2022\nCHO: 50-60%\n\u2022\nTotal fat: 20-25% with an upper safe limit of 30%\n\u2022\nProtein: 10-20%\nThis concept is however difficult for most people to interpret and implement. Thus, the focus at present, has shifted from concentrating on individual\nnutrients to food groups and dietary patterns\n8.1.1.1 Fats\nIt is generally recommended that total fats contribute to about 20-25% with an\nupper safe limit of 30% of the total calorie intake.153,318-320\nFor the prevention of CVD, the types of fatty acids consumed are more\nimportant than the total fat content.153,320\nI,B\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nFatty acids are divided into:\n1. SFA \u2013 The current recommendation is that the intake of SFA to be <10%\nof total calorie intake.153,319,320 Sources of SFA are primarily from\nanimal products, but also includes tropical plant oils. 2. Unsaturated fatty acid- Depending on the number of double bonds, these\ncan be further classified as:\n\u2022\nPUFA \u2013 These contain 2 or more double bonds. PUFA is divided into\ntwo subgroups:\n\uf0d8 Omega-3 Fatty Acid - This consists of:\no Alpha-linolenic acid - found in vegetable oils such as corn,\nsoybean, safflower and sunflower oil. o Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) - found in marine oils\no Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - found in marine oils\nSources of DHA & EPA are higher-fat, cold-water fish such as salmon,\nmackerel (kembong), herring, oily kembong (pelaling), patin, keli,\nterubuk.321\n\uf0d8 Omega-6 Fatty Acid - This consists of linoleic acid, an essential\nfatty acid that can be found in vegetable oils such as soybean, corn,\nand safflower. \u2022\nMonounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) - MUFAs are primarily from plants\nand include olive oil, canola oil and peanut oil.", "chunk_order": 34}

A central issue in the relationship between SFA and CVD is the specific\nmacronutrients that are used to replace it in the diet.153,320\nWhen PUFA, MUFA or CHO are used to replace SFA in the diet, TC, LDL-C,\napoprotein B and to a lesser extent HDL-C levels are all significantly\nreduced.322 Replacing SFA with PUFA leads to the most favourable lipoprotein\nprofiles.322\nExcess CHO intake also causes other metabolic derangements such as\ninsulin resistance, obesity and diabetes. The quality of the CHO (low versus\nhigh glycaemic index, refined starches and sugar rich beverages versus\ngrains and fruits) was not however addressed in the studies.317\nI,B\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nWhen PUFA is used to replace SFA, there is consistent data that CV events\nand coronary mortality are reduced.320 It is estimated that replacing 1% of\nenergy from SFA with PUFA lowers CHD incidence \u22652-3%.317,323 The evidence\nis not that clear that replacing SFA with MUFA or CHO lowers CVD risk.317,320\nThe total matrix of a food is more important than just its fatty acid content when\npredicting the effect of a food on CVD risk, e.g., the effect of SFA from cheese\non blood lipids and CVD may be counter-balanced by the content of protein,\ncalcium, or other components in cheese.316 In addition, the special fatty acid\nprofile of the SFA (short-chain vs medium-chain vs long chain) may modify the\neffect on CHD risk.317\nTaking PUFA or MUFA (e.g. 1 teaspoon of olive oil) without cutting down SFA\nintake will not confer CV benefit. (Appendix 4, pg 169 for fat and calorie\ncontent of common Malaysian food)\nTrans Fatty Acid (TFA)\nThis is a type of fat formed by the process of hydrogenation to increase its\nshelf life.324\nTrans fat appears to increase the risk of CVD more than any other\nmacronutrient on a per calorie basis.324 A meta-analysis has shown that on\naverage a 2% increase in energy intake from TFA increases CHD risk by\n23%.324,325 Total TFA intake was associated with all-cause mortality, CHD\nmortality and total CHD.326,327 Industrial, but not ruminant, TFA were associated\nwith CHD mortality and CHD.327\nThe current recommendation is for TFA to contribute <1% of total energy\nintake and the lower the better.153,319,320 TFA may be found in partially\nhydrogenated margarines, snack foods, bakery products and deep fried fast\nfoods.324\nThe most recent analysis from the CDC USA showed a remarkable\nimprovement in the lipoprotein profile of the American population.", "chunk_order": 35}

Lowering of\nSFA intake usually also leads to a reduction in dietary cholesterol.153,320\nSome nutrition guidelines do not give specific recommendation on the intake of\ndietary cholesterol.153,320 Although the evidence linking dietary cholesterol and CVD is\nweak, dietary cholesterol often co-exists with SFA (e.g. in meat, fried food). To avoid\nconfusion and as practical advice, most international guidelines advise limiting the\nintake of dietary cholesterol to less than 300 mg/day.329\nIn contrast to SFA and TFA, dietary cholesterol in general and cholesterol in eggs in\nparticular, have limited effects on the blood cholesterol level and on CVD.153,320,330,331\nEgg consumption of 4-7 eggs per week was shown not to be associated with an\nincreased CVD risk in diabetic or non-diabetic individuals at high CV risk.332,333\n8.1.1.3 Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates in the diet may take the form of:\n\u2022\nStarches - These include:\n\uf0d8 Starchy vegetables like sweet potatote, tapioca, yam, pumpkin, breadfruit,\ncorn and potatotes\n\uf0d8 Dried beans, lentils and peas such as as mung beans (green grams),\nchickpea, red gram, yellow dhal, lotus seed and baked beans\n\uf0d8 Grains like rice, oats, barley -these may be whole grain (entire grain kernel\ne.g. brown rice, whole meal flour) or refined grains (e.g. white rice, white\nflour)\n\u2022\nFibers - This is the indigestible part of plant foods, including fruits,\nvegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes. \u2022\nSugars - These include:\n\uf0d8 Naturally occurring sugars such as those in milk or fruit\n\uf0d8 Added sugars\nWhen recommending diets to reduce the risk of CVD and diabetes, the nature of\nCHO is of considerable importance.334 Whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes\nare the most appropriate sources as compared to sugars.

According to NHMS 2011, almost two thirds (61%) of\nindividuals with hypertension in Malaysia were unaware they were having\nhypertension.498 Of all patients with hypertension and on treatment, only 35% of them\nachieved target BP.498 With the anticipated doubling of CVD burden especially in the\ndeveloping world in the next few decades, it is imperative that major risk factors like\nhypertension be optimally managed. 9.1.1\nPreventing Hypertension\n9.1.1.1 The Population Approach\nThe objective is to prevent hypertension by lowering the average BP by a relatively\nsmall amount across a whole population. In a study done in UK, it was estimated that\na reduction in SBP as low as 2 mmHg could prevent >14,000 deaths per year.499 By\nencouraging enough people to change their lifestyles sufficiently to lower their BP,\nlarge numbers are shifted to below the threshold for hypertension (140/90 mmHg).499\nThe main lifestyle changes required to achieve this are:\n\u2022\nReducing the population average intake of salt to 5 g per day (65-75% of salt\nintake is from processed foods)500 (Appendix 9, pg 174 for salt content of\ncommon Malaysian food)\n\u2022\nIncreasing potassium intake by increasing fruit and vegetable intake to at least\nfive portions a day\n\u2022\nControlling weight to achieve a 5-10% weight loss in overweight or obese people\n\u2022\nIncreasing habitual PA to a total of at least 30 minutes a day of at least\nmoderate-intensity activity, on five or more days of the week for adults, and at\nleast 60 minutes each day for children\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\n\u2022\nAvoiding alcohol or controlling alcohol intake within recommended benchmark\nlimits for either sex\n9.1.1.2 The \u2018At-risk\u2019 Individual or Group Approach\nThis approach focuses on people known to be at higher risk of developing\nhypertension than the general population.

As far as possible, this should be achieved without causing the individual adverse\neffects from medications or other interventions. Once hypertension is diagnosed, the patient should be risk stratified (Table 14, pg 86)\nand staged accordingly. (Table 13, pg 86) The algorithm for management of\nhypertension is in Fig 1, pg 87. All patients should be counselled on non-pharmacological measures as outlined in\nSection 9.1.1.

It includes any of the following categories: (Table 17, pg 93)\n\u2022\nImpaired fasting glucose (IFG) \u2013 FBG: 6.1-6.9 mmol/L\n\u2022\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) \u2013 2-hour post load glucose level following oral\nglucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 75 gm oral glucose between 7.8 \u2013 11.1\nmmol/L\n\u2022\nPrediabetes \u2013 A1c: >5.6 to <6.3%\n9.3.1.2 Epidemiology\nIn general, the proportion of individuals with prediabetes tends to be equal or greater\nthan that of diabetes in any studied population.517\nBased on the Metabolic Syndrome Study of Malaysia (MSSM) 2008 the prevalence\nof prediabetes (based on the OGTT) among adults above the age of 18 years was\n20% while that of diabetes was 22%.518\n9.3.1.3 Prediabetes as a Risk Factor for CVD\nExisting evidence indicates that:\n\u2022\nThere is a linear relationship between blood glucose levels and CVD.519\n\u2022\nThe risk of CVD is almost 2 fold in subjects with prediabetes compared to those\nwith normal OGTT.520\n\u2022\nAll-cause and CVD mortality is significantly increased in individuals with IGT\nbut not with IFG.520\n\u2022\nAt A1c values below the diabetic range (5.7 - 6.3%) there is an increased risk\nfor CHD, stroke and death.521\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\n9.3.1.4 Diagnosis\nScreening can be done by measuring capillary blood glucose levels using\nglucometers. If the test is positive (random capillary blood glucose \u22657.8 or fasting \u2265\n5.6 mmol/L), a confirmatory test can be performed by one of the following methods:\n\u2022\nOGTT with 75 grams of glucose\n\u2022\nFBG\n\u2022\nA1c\nIf A1c is used for the diagnosis of prediabetes, it is best that the test is followed by an\nOGTT to classify individuals into either IFG, IGT or combination of both. This has\nprognostic significance in terms of the risk of developing CVD and conversion to full\nblown diabetes.520\nTable 17: Diagnosis of Prediabetes and Diabetes\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nBased on OGTT\nCategory\n0 hour (fasting*)\n2 hour\nNormal\n<6.1\n<7.8\nIFG\n6.1-6.9\n-\nIGT\n-\n7.8-11.0\nDiabetes\n\u22657.0\n\u226511.1\nBased on A1c\nBased on blood glucose levels\nNormal\n< 5.6%\n-\nPrediabetes\n5.6 to <6.3%\n-\nDiabetes\n\u22656.3%\n\u22657.0 (fasting)\n\u226511.0 (random)\n*fasting of at least 10 hours\n9.3.1.5 Who Should be Screened?

However, it is known that the risk\nof CVD starts to increase at a much lower level of blood glucose compared to the\nonset of diabetic retinopathy (Section 9.3.1.3).521\n9.3.2.1 Epidemiology\nAccording to the NHMS 2015, the prevalence of diabetes in adults above the age\nof 18 years was 17.5%.9 In addition:9,541,533\n\u2022\nThe prevalence in the 20-24 year age group was 5.9%. (Table 7, pg 28)\n\u2022\nThe prevalence was highest in the Indians (22.1%) followed by Malays (14.6%)\nand Chinese (12.0%). \u2022\nMore than half (53%) of those with diabetes were unaware of their diagnosis. \u2022\nThe percentage of undiagnosed diabetes was highest among the Malays (64%)\nfollowed by the Chinese (52%) and the Indians (42%). \u2022\nOf concern is the proportion of undiagnosed diabetes among those below the\nage of 30 years (88%). \u2022\nOnly 23.8% of patients in primary care and 12.7% in tertiary institutions were\nable to achieve their A1c targets. 9.3.2.2 Diabetes & CVD\nThe metabolic milieu of diabetes comprises mainly of but not limited to insulin\nresistance, reduced insulin secretion and/or their combination. These are\nresponsible for endothelial dysfunction, increased platelet reactivity and\ninflammation; factors that trigger and aggravate atherosclerotic vascular disease and\nthrombosis.534\nThe higher mortality and complication rates seen in diabetic patients appear to be\nmultifactorial. Diabetes is associated with:535\n\u2022\nSevere coronary artery disease. \u2022\nSystolic left ventricular dysfunction. \u2022\nAutonomic neuropathy. \u2022\nLarger infarct size.

Community, Population and Governmental Level\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major health burden to the country. Preventive care ensures a healthy population leading to a reduction in the\nexpenditure for curative care. This is the focus of the healthcare sector in the current\n11th Malaysia Plan. Health education and promotion (including media campaigns) are\nimportant in raising awareness and knowledge. However, by themselves, these are\ninadequate in achieving behavioural change. Essentially, we need \u201cpro-health\u201d\nnational policies to achieve positive behavioural changes. In accordance with the recommendations of WHO.608 Malaysia has adopted a\n\u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach to effectively prevent NCDs with strong and\nproactive involvement of many ministries and stakeholders. The 3 main modifiable\nCV risk factors \u2013 unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and smoking \u2013 have to be tackled\nsimultaneously. This involves individual behavioural modification, as well as policy\nand regulatory interventions. Malaysians need to take on more responsibility for their own health. As such, the\nMOH puts a high priority on empowering individuals and communities to take on\nself-care responsibilities and becoming a resource for themselves and others in\ndisease prevention and management. This is done through the KOmuniti Sihat,\nPerkasa Negara (KOSPEN) Program (Section 11.4, pg 122). National policies for the prevention of CVD has focused on the following main areas:\n\u2022\nTobacco control\n\u2022\nSalt reduction\n\u2022\nModifying the obesogenic environment\n\u2022\nOthers: KOSPEN\n11.1\nTobacco Control\n11.1.1\nLegislation for Tobacco Control in Malaysia\nTobacco control in Malaysia is regulated under the Control for Tobacco Products\nRegulations (CPTR) 2004, a component of the Food Act 1983. CPTR 2004 replaced\nthe old CPTR 1993, and was developed based on the WHO Framework Convention\nfor Tobacco Control (FCTC). Malaysia became a signatory to this convention on 23\nSeptember 2003, ratified it on 16 September 2005, and officially became a party 90\ndays later on 15 December 2005.

A study conducted in a\nsub-population in Malaysia in 2012 showed an average salt intake of 8.7 g/day (or\n3.4 g/day sodium), about 1.7 times higher than WHO\u2019s recommendation.612\n(Appendix 9, pg 174, for salt content of common Malaysian food)\n11.2.1\nSalt Reduction Strategy 2015-2020\nThe general objective of the Salt Reduction Strategy is to promote, educate and\ncollaborate with all related stakeholders to reduce salt intake among the Malaysian\npopulation, working towards achieving a 30% reduction in the average daily salt\nintake (from 8.7 g/day to 6.0 g/day) of the adult population by year 2025.613 Based on\nthe major sources of dietary salt/sodium in Malaysia (non-processed food),\nmodification of the population\u2019s behaviour would have the biggest impact, but\nunfortunately the interventions would be the most challenging.

Strengthening the Smoking Cessation Services\nThe mQuit services614 is a public-private initiative that aims to improve access to smoking cessation services. This was\nintroduced in 2016 to give smokers to obtain three levels of support, namely professional advice, materials to help quit smoking\nand enlisting the smoker\u2019s own willpower. Smokers will have the ease to get professional help from either the government\nhealth clinics or hospital, or from the private sector such as the community pharmacies. The delivery of the services is standardised through the national Clinical Practice Guidelines on Treatment of Tobacco\nDependence615. On top of that, a national Quitline was established to help and guide smokers to quit through behavioural\nintervention through telephone calls. 2. School programs to develop a Smokefree Malaysian Generation\nPreventative programme: Implementation of the IMFree Program616 This is an educational program for smoking prevention\namong primary school children age 7 to 12 years. Some components of the IMFree Program are also implemented in preschools under the Tunas Doktor Muda Program throughout the country. Intervention programme: The majority of smokers had their first cigarette before the age of 14 years old. Therefore, intervention\nprogrammes for school children are deemed essential. \u2022\nThe Kesihatan Oral Tanpa Asap Rokok (KOTAK) is a new initiative but as an extension to the existing\nIncremental School Dental Care programme. In this programme school children who are detected as smokers will\nbe given interventions to help them beat smoking. \u2022\nA new Guidance for Helping School Children Who Smoke was developed to give guidance to school counsellors on\nhow to manage school children who smoke. This approach is a curative approach rather than punitive. Smokers will\nbe coached on how to quit smoking properly. 3. Empowering the community\nTo empower the communities to stop smoking and creating smoke-free environments through the KOSPEN Program. KOSPEN is currently a flagship program led by the MOH for community-based NCD risk factor screening and intervention. (more information on KOSPEN in Section 11.4)\nSpecifically, for smoking, smokers identified through the screening are referred for quit smoking services available in their area. The KOSPEN volunteers could have a great influence in encouraging their fellow community members to quit smoking properly\nthrough professional smoking cessation in their local area. 4. Protecting the public from the dangers of tobacco smoke\n\u2022\nThrough volunteerism: To reduce exposure to second-hand smoke, houses in the KOSPEN area are encouraged\nto commit to \u201cMy Smokefree Home\u201d declaration and all community events declared \u201cSmoke-free\u201d.

Smoking is also prohibited on floors with a service counter in banks, financial institutions, national telecom\ncompany, national energy company and post offices. Expansion of places to be gazetted as smoke-free place is\nbeing undertaken; most recently the rest & respite areas of the federal highways \u2013 and will include all hotels, public\nparks and all restaurants. 5. Other Tobacco Control Activities\n\u2022\nTobacco Packaging and Labeling: Rotating combined picture and text health warnings are required to occupy\n50% of the front and 60% of the back of the package. The text of the warning is in Malay on the front panel and\nEnglish on the back panel.

A selected list of\nactivities under the Salt Reduction Strategy is shown in Table 27, pg 120. Table 27: Selected List of Salt Reduction Activities in Malaysia\nActivities\n1. Strategy 1: Monitoring\nA database on the salt content of processed foods with data available to the public is being\nplanned for 2018. This will assist the public in their decision during purchasing and enables\nmonitoring the trends of salt content of the processed foods over time. 2. Strategy 2: Awareness\nMass media and social marketing (using alternative media) are very important methodologies\nto educate on the relationship between salt, hypertension and heart attacks and strokes to\nthe general population. The public also needs to be educated on salt content of foods, how\nto reduce salt intake and understand salt/sodium labelling. Within specific settings, for example, school canteens, catering in the public services\nsector, hospital foods or food outlets in hospitals and health facilities, administrative\nguidelines are being introduce in a step-wise manner to reduce salt content in food\npreparations. 3.", "chunk_order": 76}

MOH is also in the process of making salt content labeling as mandatory for all processed\nfood (target date: 2018). This is important for educating the population to identify healthier\nchoices, and also to inform MOH to engage with food industries to reduce the salt content in\ntheir products. Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\n11.3\nModifying the Obesogenic Environment\nIn July 2014, the MOH requested the formation of a national level task force to tackle\nobesity in Malaysia. This comprised experts from the government, academia,\nprofessional organizations and NGOs. The final recommendations was presented\nand approved by the MOH in 2016. It was based on the current scientific evidence of cost-effectiveness. In addition to\ncost-effectiveness, considerations were also given on affordability, implementation\ncapacity, feasibility and perceived acceptability by the population.

Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\n11.4\nKOSPEN: For the Community, by the Community\nThis is an NCD risk factor community-based intervention program developed in\nresponse to the increasing prevalence of NCD risk factors, as well as to empower\nthe population to take more responsibility on their own health status. It is known as\nKomuniti Sihat Perkasa Negara (KOSPEN). The program aims at bringing the NCD\nrisk factor related activities to the community by creating trained health volunteers,\nwho will function as \u201cagents of change\u201d or health enablers who will introduce and\nfacilitate healthy living practices amongst their respective community. The main objectives of KOSPEN are to:\n\u2022\nEmpower the community in adopting and practicing healthy lifestyles and\n\u2022\nEnhance their participation and involvement in programs aiming at preventing\nand controlling NCD in Malaysia. This program was launched in 2014. Its main scope is promoting a healthy diet,\nactive living, non-smoking, weight management and routine community NCD risk\nfactor screening. The MOH is currently collaborating with the Ministry of Rural and Regional\nDevelopment (through the Department of Community Development or KEMAS) in\nimplementing KOSPEN in rural areas, and collaborating with the Department of\nNational Unity and Integration (through Rukun Tetangga) for urban and sub-urban\nareas. A group of health volunteers within the identified residences or community registered\nunder both collaborating agencies are provided with training that will enable them to\npromote healthy behaviours, advocate for healthy policy adoption and facilitate\nenvironmental changes within the local community. These trained volunteers are\nalso capable of conducting basic health screening consisting of measuring blood\npressure, blood glucose levels and BMI. They also conduct semi-structured\ninterventions, and those at high risk would be referred to nearby health clinics for\nfurther investigation and management. Primary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\n11.4.1 Status of Implementation\nAs of December 2016, 5,900 KOSPEN localities or sites have been established\nthroughout Malaysia, with more than 36,000 volunteers trained.", "chunk_order": 78}

Traditional and Complimentary Medicine\n12.1\nDefinition of Terms and Concepts\nTraditional medicine, by WHO definition,617 is the sum total of the knowledge, skills,\nand practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different\ncultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in\nthe prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. In Malaysia, it identifies strongly with the respective ethnic cultures and is often\nconsidered as an important part of their cultural heritage. Complementary medicine refers to a broad set of healthcare practices that are not\npart of that country\u2019s own traditional or conventional medicine and are not fully\nintegrated into the dominant healthcare system.618 It is often used together with\nconventional medicine. Alternative medicine, on the other hand, is used in place of conventional medicine. In Malaysia, the Traditional and Complementary Medicine ACT 775, (2016)619\ndefines the practice of T&CM as a form of health-related practice designated to\nprevent, treat or manage ailment or illness or preserve the mental and physical\nwell-being of an individual. The handbook on T&CM outlines the program in\nMalaysia.618\nAccording to the Act 775, T&CM practices includes:\n\u2022\nTraditional Malay medicine\n\u2022\nTraditional Chinese medicine\n\u2022\nTraditional Indian medicine\n\u2022\nIslamic medical practice\n\u2022\nHomeopathy and\n\u2022\nComplementary therapies\nIt excludes medical and dental practices used by medical and dental practitioners\nrespectively.

When T&CM was used as treatment, the intended use was for primary healthcare\nand complementary treatment. About 18.3% of those surveyed intended to use of\nT&CM as an alternative treatment.620\nIn a survey conducted in a rural setting, 31.7% (about 1 in 3) of about 2,800\nrespondents with CV risk factors were using T&CM, and 20-30% of these were using\nthis as a substitute to their conventional medicine.621\nThere has been no specific research conducted locally on the use of T&CM by\npatients with CVD. Research from Australia and the USA show the following\ntrends:622-627\n\u2022\nThe prevalence of T&CM use is high and fast growing. \u2022\nThere is lack of sound, evidence-based professional resources for reliable\ninformation about the safety and efficacy of T&CM treatments on CVD. \u2022\nThere exists a patient-doctor communication gap. \u2022\nPatients\u2019 reluctance to communicate about T&CM use with medical doctors out\nof fear of disapproval is just as significant a problem as health professionals\u2019\nhesitancy to discuss this topic with their patients. \u2022\nMost medical doctor and pharmacists believe that they lack the resources and\ntraining to respond to patients\u2019 inquiries about T&CM use. The areas of concern mentioned above require long term efforts in education and\nresearch by all the stakeholders. In short term, frequent interaction, exchange of idea as well as information with\ncredible T&CM practitioners specialised in CVD through periodic seminar, workshop\nand conference may be helpful in promoting mutual understanding.

IIb,C\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nHowever, there are also weaknesses in the T&CM industry. While there are a\nsmall number of credible practitioners, most of them require further training\nand upgrading of their knowledge before they can contribute positively to the\nprevention strategy. These practitioners should not replace conventional mainstream health\nprofessionals as sources of medical advice for the prevention of CVD. The practice of TCM is based on TCM evidence rather than scientific\nevidence. Even the terminology CVD is being interpreted based on pathology\nand physiology of conventional medicine and not based on the TCM\nphilosophy. While they make a lot of reference to scientific investigations such\nas laboratory and imaging investigation, they draw on TCM\u2019s profound and\nunique philosophy of Yin Yang and Five Element theories for diagnosis,\ntreatment, rehabilitation and prevention. The object of TCM treatment is not\nCVD itself but to restore the disharmony of Yin Yang. TCM has it unique,\ncomplete and time tested body of knowledge and theories which follow a\npathway different from conventional medicine and which existed long before\nthe birth of modern science. A meta-analysis found insufficient or conflicting evidence for the use of TCM\nin CVD prevention.645\nT&CM practices such as Traditional Indian Medicine and Homeopathy have\nclaimed benefits in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Miscellaneous Frequently Asked Questions and\nMyths\n13.1\nChelation Therapy\nChelation therapy (CT) is defined as the use of repeated administration of\nethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) with or without the combination of\nvitamins, trace elements and iron supplements as an alternative treatment\noption for vascular diseases. It is given via an intravenous concoction of\ninfusions, often several days apart for 20 to 30 sessions. It is proven therapy\nand is efficacious in heavy metal poisoning involving lead, iron and other\nmetals.647\nThe evidence to support the use of CT in prevention of CVD is extremely weak\nand should be avoided.648-653\nThere are risks associated with CT. Renal failure, arrhythmias, tetany,\nhypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hypotension, bone marrow depression,\nprolonged bleeding time, convulsions, respiratory arrest, and autoimmune\ndiseases have all been described. Until further data is available, CT cannot be recommended as an option for the\ntreatment or prevention of CVD.648-653\n13.2\nOzone\nOzone is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula O3. It is a\ncontroversial gas because, owing to its potent oxidant properties, it exerts\ndamaging effects on the respiratory tract and yet it has been used for decades\nas researchers believes it has many therapeutic effects.654-656 Hence, due to\nits toxic effects on the respiratory tract, it should never be given via\ninhalation.657 Medical O3 is used to disinfect equipment by inactivation of\nbacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast and protozoa.658 It is also used in dental\npractice.658,659 There have been claims that it activates the immune system but\nthere is no scientific evidence to support this.658\nThe gas produced from medical grade oxygen is administered in precise\ntherapeutic doses.

It is not recommended. The Malaysian Medical Council prohibits any registered medical doctor from\npracticing ozone therapy.669\n13.3\nStem Cells\nStem cells is being promoted as a form of regenerative therapy. However,\ncurrently there is little evidence to support the use of stem cells in the\nprevention or treatment of CVD.670,671\n13.4\nAnti-aging (vascular aging)\nTelomeres are essential parts of human cells (chromosomes) that affect how\nour cells age. The length of telomeres is a biomarker of age, a shorter\ntelomere length is associated with older age, atherosclerosis and other CV\nrisk factors such as hypertension, adiposity, diabetes, smoking and physical\ninactivity. A healthy lifestyle, increased physical activity and appropriate drug use (e.g. statins for hypercholesterolemia) prevent shortening of the telomere, reduces\nthe risk of atherosclerosis and also improves life expectancy by anti-aging\neffects.672\nIII,B\nIIb,B\nPrimary & Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease 2017\nSeveral agents such as metformin and reserveterol have been thought to\nslow the ageing process. At present, there is insufficient evidence that they do\nso.673,674\nThe use of hormones (growth hormones, TRT, placental hormone, stem cells\netc) has not been proven to have any anti-aging effects and has the potential\nfor harm. The committee does not recommend the use of hormones as anti-aging\nagents. Recommendations:\n\u2022\nThere is no role for chelation therapy, ozone therapy, stem cells or anti\naging therapy in the prevention or treatment of CVD.

There are four major practice areas in TMM:\n\u2022 Traditional Malay Massage (Urut Melayu)- This is a massage technique comprising of kneading,\nstroking and pressing with hands and application of herbal oils to ease the massage. The\npractitioner uses his/her thumbs, palms, elbows and/or feet in applying a sustained mechanical\npressure during massage. Sometime massage tool such as wooden stick, comb, and horn may\nbe used as an aid during the massage. Traditional Malay massage may involve recitation of\nprayers. \u2022 Malay Herbs- Herbs are used as a complement therapy in TMM in the treatment of a disease or\nenhancement of wellness.

The principal objectives of Ayurveda are maintenance and\npromotion of health, prevention of disease and cure of sickness. It is a famous practice in North\nIndia. It is a system based on 5 elements-space, air, fire, water and earth; and treatment concept\nbased on balance of the three elemental substances. These elemental substances combine in\nthe human body to form three life forces or energies, the Doshas. The Doshas consist of Vata\n(kinetic energy), Pitta (thermal energy), Kapha (potential energy) that governs physiological and\npsychological functions of the body. An equal balance of the 3 doshas leads to health, while\nimbalance in them leads to disease. Ayurveda emphasizes on Dietary Principles (Ahara Niyma),\nDaily regimen (Ritucharya), Good conduct/social behaviour (Sadavritta), the use of plant based\nmedicines and treatments. \u2022 Siddha came from the word siddhi, which means perfection of heavenly bliss.

Siddha system\ngained popularity in South India especially in Tamil Nadu. Siddha medicine is a form of the TIM\nthat uses a therapeutic concept. It is assumed that when the normal equilibrium of the three\nhumors (Vaadham, Pittham and Kabam) is disturbed, disease is caused. The factors, assumed\nto affect this equilibrium, are environment, climatic condition, diet, physical activities, and stress. According to the siddha medical system, diet and life style play a major role, not only in health\nbut also in curing disease. \u2022 Unani is a form of TIM practiced mostly by Indian Muslim. According to its teachings, the body\nis comprised of four basic elements (earth, air, water and fire) and four humors (blood, phlegm,\nyellow bile, and black bile). Equilibrium in the humor indicates good health while a disturbance\nin this equilibrium results in disease. \u2022 Yoga is a practice that involves physical movement, mental focus and spiritual strength. It\noriginates from ancient India. The aim is to achieve a peaceful state of mind. Yoga also has been\npopularly defined as \u201cunion with the divine\u201d in the context of other traditions.

Homeopathy\nThis is a system based on Samuel Hahneman\u2019s doctrine of \u201clike cures like\u201d, according to which a\nsubstance that causes the symptoms of disease in healthy people will cure similar symptoms in sick\npeople. Hahneman believed that the underlying causes of disease were phenomena that he termed\nmiasms and homeopathic remedies addressed these. Homeopathy remedies are based on plant,\nmineral and animal substances. Islamic medical practice\nIslamic medical practice is used in the treatment of physical and spiritual ailments.
