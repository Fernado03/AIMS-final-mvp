MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n1\nSTATEMENT OF INTENT\nThese guidelines are developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the management of\ndyslipidemia, based on the best available evidence at the time of development. Speci\ufb01c attempts\nwere made to use local data and publications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this\nguideline does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care. Every\nhealth care provider is responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical presentation and management options available locally. STATEMENT OF INTENT\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nCPG Secretariat\nThis guideline is issued in 2023 and will be reviewed in about 5 years or earlier if important new\nevidence becomes available.

This CPG supersedes the previous CPG. MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n2\nNearly 30 years since the publication of the first Malaysian\nConsensus on management of hyperlipidaemia, I am proud to\nannounce the publication of the 6th Clinical Practice Guidelines\n(CPG) on the management of dyslipidemia. Since the 5th CPG,\npublished in 2017, there has been much development in both\ndiagnosis and treatments of dyslipidemia. This CPG is timely, as\nMalaysia has seen a rise in the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia\nin adults - a rise of 31.5% in 2011 to 38.1% in 2019. Dyslipidemia remains one of the most deadly of the established\ncardiovascular risk factors. Compared to cigarette smoking, hypertension\nand diabetes, dyslipidemia is often only diagnosed when patients develop\ntheir first acute vascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke. Therefore, with the advent\nof such new therapeutics now available, with accompanying safety and efficacy clinical data,\nthis CPG is timely to enable all healthcare professionals to optimise the management of their\npatients with dyslipidemia. This CPG comes with 13 new key messages and 19 key recommendations, valuable\nadditions from the last CPG.", "chunk_order": 0}

This CPG comes with 13 new key messages and 19 key recommendations, valuable\nadditions from the last CPG. The main aims of this 2023 CPG are to reduce the level of\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), introduce new medications that can be used, in particularly\nfor secondary preventions; and new updates in the Medical Nutrition therapy section. A\nsignificant reduction the LDL-C targets will see a corresponding reduction in serious cardiovascular\noutcomes. Improved point-of-care diagnostics will lead to more of the population to be\ndiagnosed with dyslipidemia, and an aggressive, multi-aspect management plan being\nformulated, and administered, to each individual. I would like to thank the Chairperson of the Writing Committee - Dr Jeyamalar Rajadurai -\nand her colleagues, and all those who contributed towards the publication of this CPG. I am certain that, with its dissemination, the burden of cardiovascular disease attributed to\ndyslipidemia, will be attenuated, and its deadly manifestations in the form of acute vascular\nevents can be mitigated. For a condition so prevalent in Malaysia, this CPG will be a\nvaluable resource from healthcare professionals practising at primary to tertiary care\ncentres, and provide useful guidance to all stakeholders, so that this multidisciplinary\napproach will translate to improved health outcomes for both patients, and the population as\na whole.

The prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors - dyslipidemia, hypertension,\ndiabetes, smoking and overweight/obesity - has been on an increasing trend.5,7,8 Malaysians\ndevelop heart disease at a younger age when compared to people in Thailand, mainland\nChina and western countries.10 Our local NCVD-ACS Registry (2018-2019) showed that\nmost patients (93.5%) had at least one established CV risk factor-hypertension (61.9%),\ndyslipidemia (36.7%) or diabetes (44.2%).10 About 40.3% (2 persons out of 5) had \u2265 3 CV\nrisk factors.10\nIn preventing CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing the individual\u2019s global CV risk. This\nClinical Practice Guideline (CPG) is on management of dyslipidemia. The last CPG (5th\nedition) was published in 2017. Thus, the need for an update. Objectives:\nThe objectives of this clinical practice guidelines are to review:\n\uf06c The clinical evidence linking dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis and determining which\nlipid parameters should be targeted.", "chunk_order": 2}

Process:\nThis CPG has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart Association\nof Malaysia, Ministry of Health and the Academy of Medicine. It comprises cardiologists,\nendocrinologists, general physicians, pharmacists and dieticians from the government and\nprivate sectors as well as from the Universities. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases - PubMed and\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. The following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\nterms or free text terms were used either singly or in combination:\n\u201cHyperlipidemia\u201d; \u201cDyslipidemia\u201d; \u201cHypercholesterolemia\u201d; \u201cCholesterol\u201d; \u201cLDL-Cholesterol\u201d\n\u201cHDL-Cholesterol\u201d; \u201cTriglycerides\u201d; Diabetic dyslipidemia\u201d\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans, and published in the\nEnglish language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge list. In\naddition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further\nstudies. The search was conducted from 31st August 2016 (date of last review for previous\nCPG) till 31st August 2022. Local guidelines were also studied. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain further\ninformation. International guidelines mainly that from the American Heart Association/\nAmerican College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology were\nused as main references. RATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT\nMANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n6\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up by the members of the Expert Panel and\nsubmitted to the Technical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, Ministry of\nHealth Malaysia, and key health personnel in the major hospitals of the Ministry of Health,\nUniversities and the Private Sector for review and feedback. The clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of the Expert Panel\nwere assigned individual topics. The group members met several times throughout the\ndevelopment of the guideline. All retrieved literature was appraised by individual members\nand subsequently presented for discussion during group meetings. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated were agreed collectively by members of the Expert Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient the recommendations were derived by consensus of\nthe Panel. The draft was then sent to local external reviewers for comments.

Clinical Questions Addressed:\nIn addition to the old clinical questions that were updated, several new clinical questions\nwere formulated using the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) method,\naddressing the diagnosis and therapy of dyslipidemia. For diagnosis:\nWhich lipid parameters contribute to CV risk? Which are the most cost effective to treat considering our resources.? For therapy, the topics and subtopics were as follows:\nP: Population - Persons\nWith heart disease (secondary prevention)\n\uf06c Without heart disease (primary prevention)\n\uf06c With diabetes\n\uf0d8 Type 2 diabetes\n\uf0d8 Type 1 diabetes\n\uf06c With Chronic Kidney Disease\n\uf0d8 Not on kidney replacement therapy\n\uf077 With co-existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf077 Without co-existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf0d8 On kidney replacement therapy\n\uf077 Co-existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf077 Without co-existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf06c With Heart Failure\n\uf0d8 With co-existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf0d8 Without co-existing cardiovascular disease (dilated cardiomyopathy)\n\uf06c With Specific Lipid Disorders\n\uf0d8 High TG\n\uf0d8 With co-existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf0d8 Without co \u2013existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf06c Low HDL-C\n\uf0d8 With co-existing cardiovascular disease\n\uf0d8 Without co \u2013existing cardiovascular disease\nMANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n7\n\uf06c Elderly\n\uf06c Women\n\uf06c Children and adolescents\nI: Intervention:\nTotal and LDL-Cholesterol lowering\n\uf06c HDL- Cholesterol raising\n\uf06c Triglyceride lowering\nC: Comparison:\n\uf06c Therapeutic lifestyle intervention vs placebo\n\uf06c Pharmacological therapy vs lifestyle intervention\nO: Outcome:\n\uf06c Reduction in Cardiovascular Disease - Events, vascular mortality\n\uf06c Reduction in All-cause mortality\nType of Question - Involves:\n\uf06c Therapy - Lipid lowering. \uf06c Harm - Increase in Cardiovascular Event Rate, Adverse effects due to Lipid lowering\nand/or Pharmacotherapy. \uf06c Prognosis - Cardiovascular Risk Reduction\n\uf06c Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease\nType of Study\n\uf06c Systematic review and meta-analysis\n\uf06c Randomised Controlled Studies\n\uf06c Cohort studies\nThus, there were numerous clinical questions formulated. e.g. of some of these Clinical Questions:\n\uf06c In persons with CVD (secondary prevention), which lipid parameter is the most\nbeneficial and cost effective to treat leading to a reduction in cardiovascular (CV) event\nrate, CV mortality and total mortality? \uf06c In persons with CVD (secondary prevention), which means of treatment (therapeutic\nlifestyle changes vs pharmacotherapy) is the most beneficial and cost effective leading\nto a reduction in CV event rate, CV mortality and total mortality? \uf06c In persons without CVD but with diabetes, which lipid parameter is the most beneficial\nand cost effective to treat leading to a reduction in CV event rate, CV mortality and\ntotal mortality?", "chunk_order": 4}

Target Population:\nEveryone - All individuals with and without cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes,\nChronic Kidney Disease, Heart Failure, Specific Lipid Disorders, Elderly, Women, Children,\nand adolescents. Period of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with recent\nscientific research and knowledge. Applicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThese guidelines were developed considering our local health resources. \uf06c Blood chemistry for lipid profiles, liver and kidney function tests can be done in all\ngovernment health facilities. The use of non-fasting samples to assess lipid\nprofile simplifies workflow and makes it easier for patients. \uf06c Almost all the medications recommended are approved for use in Malaysia and\navailable in public hospitals. Potent statins and ezetimibe are available as\ngenerics in the government formulary. \uf06c These guidelines aim to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimize\nexisting resources in the management of dyslipidemia. Facilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barriers for successful implementation of this CPG are the lack of knowledge of the:\n\uf06c role of cholesterol (especially LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of CVD. \uf06c benefits of total cholesterol (especially LDL-C) lowering. \uf06c long-term safety profile of pharmacotherapy among both healthcare professionals\nand the public. \uf06c Lack of knowledge of the benefits and safety of the very low levels of LDL-C\nrecommended for individuals in secondary prevention. Implementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical governance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\uf06c Increasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the importance\nof knowing their individual CV risk. \uf06c Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on CV risk assessment\ntools and the implementation of appropriate preventative strategies depending on\neveryone\u2019s CV risk status. This can be done by road shows, electronic media, and in\nhouse training sessions.", "chunk_order": 5}

This is almost 10 years younger than that seen in Singapore. \uf06c The prevalence of the common cardiovascular (CV) risk factors among adults > 18 years\nhas been on an increasing trend. \uf06c About 40% of patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome have >3 CV risk factors. Key Message #2: Measurement of Lipids and Apolipoproteins\n\uf06c A standard lipid profile includes measurement of Plasma or serum total cholesterol (TC),\nLDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) and Triglycerides (TG). \uf06c TC, HDL-C and TG are measured directly from the serum and LDL-C is calculated\nusing the Friedwald\u2019s equation provided TG < 4.5mmol/l. Key messages #3: Classification of Dyslipidemia\n\uf06c Dyslipidemias may be primary due to genetic disorders or secondary to nephrotic\nsyndrome, cholestatic liver disease, hypothyroidism, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, drugs,\nalcoholism, and insulin resistance states such as Type 2 diabetes and metabolic\nsyndrome. Key Messages #4: Dyslipidemia as a CV Risk Factor\n\uf06c LDL-C:\n\uf0d8 This has been shown to be an important causative factor in the development of\natherosclerotic vascular disease based on numerous epidemiological, genetic and\nclinical interventional trials. \uf0d8 Based on the Malaysian NCVD-ACS Registry 2018-2019:\n\uf077 The prevalence of dyslipidemia among individuals admitted with ACS was 36.7%. \uf077 The mean LDL-C on admission was 3.1mmol/l in males and 3.0mmol/l in females. \uf06c Non-HDL-C:\n\uf0d8 Reflects the concentration of cholesterol within all lipoprotein particles considered\natherogenic. This includes chylomicrons, VLDL and their remnants, IDL, LDL and Lp(a). \uf0d8 Studies have demonstrated that non-HDL-C is a better predictor of CV risk than is LDL-C. \uf06c Atherogenic dyslipidemia:\n\uf0d8 This consists of an increase in TG-rich lipoproteins, low HDL-C, lipoprotein remnants\n(i.e. small VLDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein [IDL]) and a preponderance of\nnumerous small and dense LDL particles and postprandial hyperlipidemia. \uf0d8 It is usually associated with insulin resistance states such as obesity, metabolic\nsyndrome, and type 2 diabetes. \uf06c Lp(a)\n\uf0d8 This has been shown to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, MI,\nstrokes, and aortic stenosis. \uf0d8 The difficulty, to date, has been that there is no standardized assay to measure the\nLp(a), the \u201cnormal levels\u201d in the different populations is still unknown and the lack of\neffective therapy specifically targeting it.

Key messages #6: Management of Dyslipidemia-Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes\n\uf06c Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain a critical component of CVD risk reduction. It is\nimportant both prior to, and, after commencement of lipid lowering therapies in all individuals. Key messages #7: Management of Dyslipidemia- Lipid Modifying Drugs\n\uf06c Statins are the drug of choice for reducing LDL-C in a wide range of individuals with\ndyslipidemia in both primary and secondary prevention. \uf06c Some individuals may require combination therapy to achieve LDL-C goals. Key messages #8: Primary Prevention\n\uf06c Maintaining a healthy lifestyle - a healthy diet, weight control, increased exercise and\nthe avoidance or cessation of smoking - plays an important role in the prevention of CVD. Key Message #9: Dyslipidemia in Thyroid Disease and Cushing Syndrome\n\uf06c Thyroid hormones have profound effects on lipoprotein metabolism. \uf06c Dyslipidemia is a common metabolic abnormality in Cushing syndrome, the prevalence\nranging from 12% to 72%. Key Messages #10: Dyslipidemia in Patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n\uf06c CVD has become an important cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This\nmay be due to the:\n\uf0d8 HIV infection itself, which may produce a cardiometabolic type of syndrome. \uf0d8 metabolic changes associated with anti-retroviral therapy (ART). \uf0d8 associated CV risk factors such as smoking and recreational drug use (e.g. cocaine). Key Messages #11: Dyslipidemia in Psychiatric Disorders\n\uf06c Psychiatric patients have a higher risk of developing CVD. \uf06c In addition, antipsychotic drugs also induce a dyslipidemia which increases the risk\nfor developing further metabolic complications and CVD. Key Messages #12: Dyslipidemia in Women, Children, Adolescents and Elderly\n\uf06c The goals of lipid lowering therapy is similar in both gender and in the elderly. Target\nLDL-C levels will depend on the global CV risk (Table 4, pg. 26)\n\uf06c Children whose lipid levels are significantly elevated may have a genetic dyslipidemia\nand should be referred to specialists interested in this field. \uf06c When prescribing lipid lowering therapy in the elderly, the presence of co-morbidities\nand altered pharmacokinetics should be considered.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nKey Recommendations #1: Measurement of Lipids and\nApolipoproteins\n\uf06c Non-fasting lipid testing is acceptable. I,A\n\uf06c The difference in values between fasting and non-fasting\nsamples is small and has been shown to have no impact on\nCV risk estimation. \uf06c Measurement of TC (and its usual conventional derivatives -\nHDL-C, LDL-C and TG) is sufficient in most cases for CV risk\nassessment and treatment, given healthcare cost and the\nlimited ability of most laboratories to measure apolipoproteins. \uf06c Most of the CV benefits seen, is with LDL-C lowering. I,A\nKey Recommendation #2: Secondary Dyslipidemia\n\uf06c Treatment of the underlying etiology in secondary\nI,C\ndyslipidemia can lead to an improvement in the lipid profile. Key Recommendations #3: Targets of Therapy\n\uf06c LDL-C is the primary target of therapy in both secondary and\nI,A\nprimary prevention. \uf06c Both the absolute value of LDL-C achieved and the\nI,A\npercentage reduction in LDL-C lead to CV benefits. \uf06c The lower the LDL-C achieved, the greater the CV benefit. At\nI,A\nlevels <1.8mmol/L, less progression of the atherosclerotic\nplaque is seen and at levels <1.6mmol/L, regression of the\nplaque has been documented.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Epidemiology\nIn 2019, pre pandemic, non -communicable diseases accounted for 7 of the 10 leading\ncauses of deaths globally.1,2 This was about 74% of all deaths and the leading cause was\ncardiovascular deaths- Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and strokes.2\nIn Malaysia, in 2020, ischemic heart disease remained the principal cause of medically\ncertified deaths accounting for 17.0% of all deaths.3 It had been the leading cause of deaths\nfor more than 2 decades and for the first time in 2021, it was overtaken by Covid-19\ninfections, and it dropped to second place, accounting for 13.7% of all deaths.4\nThe most recent 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) reported that among\nadults aged \u226518 years, the prevalence of some cardiovascular (CV) risk factors - diabetes\nand overweight/obesity - were on an increasing trend.5 On the other hand, the prevalence of\nhypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking, although still high, appeared to have\nstabilized and seemed to be on the downward trend.5 (Table 7, pg.", "chunk_order": 18}

Risk Factor clustering was common with almost 40% having 3 or more CV risk\nfactors.10\n1.2. Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease\nIn the prevention of CVD, efforts should be aimed at reducing global CV risk. This guideline\nemphasizes:\n\uf06c A multifactorial approach that addresses all CV risk factors. This is because the benefits\nof modifying several risk factors simultaneously are synergistic. \uf06c That preventing CVD should be directed at global CVD burden rather than heart disease alone. There already exist clinical practice guidelines addressing specific CV risk factors. The\nobjectives of this CPG on the Management of Dyslipidemia are to:\n\uf06c Critically review the role of dyslipidemia as a CV risk factor. \uf06c Provide treatment strategies for managing dyslipidemia, in the following situations:\n\uf0d8 High risk individuals - these include those who have:\n\uf077 Established CVD (i.e., secondary prevention)\n\uf077 Diabetes, multiple CV risk factors and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (i.e., primary\nprevention in high-risk individuals). \uf0d8 Individuals who are otherwise healthy (i.e., primary prevention). MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n30\n\uf06c Provide strategies for the successful implementation and dissemination of the\nrecommendations, utilizing and optimizing existing health resources.

Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)\nThis is usually calculated by the Friedewald equation. This equation is not valid if the TG >\n4.5 mmol/L. In these cases, it will have to be measured directly. However, the method of\nmeasurement is not standardized and for this reason it is not routinely performed. There have been reports indicating that Friedewald-calculated LDL-C values lose their\naccuracy in patients with TG \u22651.7mmol/l or LDL-C <1.8mmol/l.16,17 A large analysis, however,\ncomparing the different methods of LDL-C calculation - the Friedewald, Martin-Hopkins, NIH\nequation 2 and BQ-derived methods - found that the correlation between all methods was\ngood and the differences small and clinically insignificant.18\nFriedewald equation:\nLDL-C (mmol/L) = TC - HDL-C - TG/2.2\n(If TG> 4.5 mmol/L, this formula is not valid.)\n2.2.

Triglycerides\nNon-fasting TG measurements are more predictive of CV risk than fasting TG.21\nNon-fasting TG more accurately reflects the presence of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins\ncompared to fasting TG measurements. There is however a lack of a standardized protocol\nfor quantitation of post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia. This limits its clinical applicability.21\n2.4. Fasting vs Non-fasting Lipid Measurement\nNon-fasting lipid testing is acceptable.22 The difference in values between fasting and\nnon-fasting samples is small and has been shown to have no impact on CV risk estimation\neven in diabetics.23 Concentrations of HDL-C, apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-AI), apolipoprotein B\n(Apo B), and Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) are not affected by fasting/non-fasting status.

According to the\nMalaysian NCVD-ACS Registry 2018-2019, the prevalence of dyslipidemia among\nindividuals admitted with Acute Coronary Syndrome was 36.7%.10 The mean LDL-C on\nadmission was 3.1 mmol/l in males and 3.0 mmol/l in females.10\nReducing LDL-C has been shown in numerous secondary and primary prevention trials to\nreduce CVD events and mortality.42-45\nThe evidence of the CV benefits of reducing TG and/or increasing HDL-C has been less\nrobust. TC, HDL-C and TG are measured directly from the serum. 4.1. Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)\nLDL-C plays a major causal role in the development of CVD. This role has been demonstrated\nin many epidemiological and mendelian studies and in randomized controlled trials of LDL-C\nlowering.46-57 Mendelian disorders such as Familial Hypercholesterolemia, where LDL levels\nare high, lead to a high incidence of premature CVD.58\nThe risk of CVD is also determined by the duration of exposure to high levels of LDL-C. Studies have shown that young adults with elevated LDL-C have significant long-term risk\nfor CVD.59,60 In Familial Hypercholesterolemia, manifestations of premature CVD become\napparent early in the third decade of life.61-65 On the other hand, there is a near absence of\nclinical CHD in populations with very low levels of serum cholesterol throughout their\nlife- (TC < 3.9 mmol/L or LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L).66,67 The risk of CHD appears to increase\nprogressively above these levels.

A 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C\nresulted in a relative risk reduction of major CV events by 22% and all-cause mortality by\n10%.42 A meta regression analysis showed that the reduction of LDL-C by 1 mmol/L, by\nwhatever mechanism, resulted in a similar reduction in major CV events.44 The achieved\nabsolute LDL-C level was significantly associated with the absolute rate of major coronary\nevents.44 For each 1 mmol/L lower LDL-C level, there was a 1.5% lower event rate in the\nprimary prevention trials and a 4.6% lower event rate in the secondary prevention trials.44\nFor these reasons, LDL-C is the primary target of therapy in both secondary and primary\nprevention.42-45 Both the absolute value of LDL-C achieved and the percentage reduction in\nLDL-C lead to CV benefits.44,68-84\nLowering TC and LDL-C lowers CV risk, the absolute benefit is greater in high-risk\nIndividuals.42-45 The lower the LDL-C achieved, the greater the CV benefit.72-80 At levels\n<1.8mmol/L, less progression of the atherosclerotic plaque is seen and at levels\n<1.6mmol/L, regression of the plaque has been documented.81-84\n4.

High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C)\nIsolated Low HDL-C is more common among Asians than non-Asians (33.1% vs 27.0%).85\nIt is associated with a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and avoidance of alcohol intake.85 A low\nHDL-C especially when combined with high LDL-C and high TG is associated with an\nincrease in CV risk.86,87\nDespite this, increasing HDL-C levels by pharmacotherapy or by genetic techniques have\nnot shown an improvement in CV outcomes.88\n4.3. Triglycerides (TG)\nIn some people, despite achieving low LDL-C levels, the rate of CV events is still significantly\nhigh. This residual CV risk is partly contributed by cholesterol remnant particles - TG and\nTG-rich lipoproteins.89,90\nAn increase in TG levels is due to multiple factors. These include genetic factors, systemic\nillnesses e.g., hypothyroidism, poorly control diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, a\nhigh calorie diet and certain medications.90\nRecent epidemiological and mendelian studies have shown that high TG levels may have a\ndirect causal effect on CVD and is associated with an increase in all-cause mortality among\npersons with established CVD.91,92\nPreviously, reducing TG levels by pharmacotherapy has not demonstrated an improvement\nin CV outcomes.", "chunk_order": 25}

Non-HDL-C\nNon-HDL-C reflects the concentration of cholesterol within all lipoprotein particles\nconsidered atherogenic. This includes chylomicrons, VLDL and their remnants, IDL, LDL\nand Lp(a). Studies have demonstrated that non-HDL-C is a better predictor of CV risk than is LDL-C\nand may be especially true in statin-treated patients.97-103 A 1% reduction in Non-HDL-C by\nlipid modifying drugs has been shown to be associated with a 1% reduction in CHD.104\nNon-HDL-C is the secondary target of therapy. In cases where the TG>4.5 mmol/l,\nNon-HDL-C becomes the primary target of therapy. 4.5. Atherogenic Dyslipidemia\nAtherogenic dyslipidemia consists of an increase in TG-rich lipoproteins, low HDL-C,\nlipoprotein remnants (i.e. small VLDL and IDL) and a preponderance of numerous small and\ndense LDL particles and postprandial hyperlipidemia. Atherogenic dyslipidemia is usually associated with insulin resistance states such as\nobesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

(Appendix 1, pg. 90-91) The cut-off points that are used in these risk models to define risk categories are\nin part arbitrary. They are based on the risk levels at which the stipulated CV end points\nwas seen in the population studied and the levels at which benefit was demonstrated in\nclinical trials. \uf06c All risk models have limitations and difficulty when extrapolated to our local population.

Total Fats - Saturated and Unsaturated Fats\n\uf06c Fats in the diet consist of TG which is made up of three fatty acids and a glycerol backbone. \uf06c Fatty acids differ in the length of their aliphatic tails, ranging from short chain (\u2264 5) to very\nlong chain (\u2265 22) fatty acids. Depending on the number of double bonds, fatty acids can\nbe further categorized as:\n\uf0d8 Saturated fatty acids (SFA)\n: no double bonds\n\uf0d8 Unsaturated fats which may occur as either:\n\uf077 polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)\n: 2 or more double bonds\n\uf077 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)\n: 1 double bond\n\uf06c Oils are mixtures of fatty acids. For fatty acid composition of common dietary oils and\nselected Malaysian food, refer to Appendix 3 & 4, pg. 93-95).183\n\uf06c Omega fatty acids are PUFA and include:\n\uf0d8 Omega-6 fatty acids - linoleic acid found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, safflower,\nsoybean, corn, grapeseed, peanut, and canola oils as well as nuts and seeds.184\n\uf0d8 Omega-3 fatty acids which consist of:\n\uf077 \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA) - found in plant oils, canola oil, flaxseed oil, soybean, chia\nseed, linseed and rapeseed oils, walnuts, and leafy green vegetables.185-187\n\uf077 Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) - present in marine oils such as fish oils.188\n\uf077 Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - present in marine oils such as fish oils.188,189\n\uf06c The rate of conversion of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids in the body is low.187\nThus it is important to increase the intake of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet.

This in turn, results in an\nincrease in clearance of LDL- and other Apo B-containing lipoproteins, including TG-rich\nparticles from the plasma. \uf06c LDL-C reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid lowering therapy to\nreduce risk of CVD.42-45,134,135,266 They are the drugs of choice in reducing LDL-C because\nof the consistent results of numerous randomized primary and secondary prevention\nclinical trials.42-45,134,135,266\nI, C\nI, A\nMANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n54\n\uf06c The amount of CV risk reduction seen will depend:42-45,68-84\n\uf0d8 on the absolute risk of the individual - In primary prevention, the absolute benefit from\nstatin treatment is lower since these individuals are typically at lower risk. \uf0d8 the degree of LDL-C lowering that is achieved (level of LDL-C achieved and/or the\npercentage reduction). \uf06c Depending on the treatment level of LDL-C level achieved, lipid modifying agents can\nslow the progression and even promote regression of coronary atherosclerotic\nplaques.81-84,267,268\n\uf06c An achieved on-treatment LDL-C level of < 1.6 mmol/L appears to significantly slow down\nprogression of atherosclerosis.81-84,267,268\n7.2.1.1. Lipid Lowering Effects of Statins\n\uf06c The degree of LDL-C reduction seen with the different statins is dose-dependent. (Table 12, pg.59)269\n\uf0d8 A high intensity statin (i.e atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg) can, on average,\nreduce LDL-C by > 50%. \uf0d8 A moderate-intensity statin reduces LDL-C by about 30-50%. \uf06c Statins reduce TG levels by 10-20% from baseline values.270 High intensity Statins have\nmoderate effect in lowering TG and in elevating HDL-C. (Table 12, pg.59)\n\uf06c Statins have either no effect or result in a small increase in Lp(a) levels.271 The magnitude\nof relative risk reduction in CV events with statin therapy was, however, similar among\nparticipants with high or low Lp(a).271\n\uf06c Statins also have other pleiotropic effects - anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects - that\nare potentially relevant for the prevention of CVD.272-274\n7.2.1.2. Initiating Statin Therapy\n\uf06c Since cholesterol is biosynthesized in the early morning hours, statins with shorter\nhalf-lives (pravastatin 1-3 hours, lovastatin 2 hours, simvastatin < 5 hours, and fluvastatin\n< 3 hours) should be administered in the evening.", "chunk_order": 44}

(Table 4, pg. 26)\n\uf0d8 The total CV risk will help determine the LDL-C treatment target. \uf0d8 Involve the patient in the decision-making process on managing his/her CV risk. \uf0d8 Choose a statin regimen that is likely to reach the target LDL-C level.

Muscle Symptoms\n\uf06c In clinical practice and in registries, 10-30% of patients report statin-associated muscle\nsymptoms (SAMS).294,295 This includes myalgia (CK normal), myositis (CK > ULN) and\nrhabdomyolysis (CK > 10X of ULN). \uf06c The incidence of SAMS is much lower in clinical trials, and only differs slightly from\nplacebo.296-298 In observational studies, however, the frequency varies between 10 and\n15%.299,300\n\uf06c In a study by Parker designed specifically to study the effects of statins on muscle\nsymptoms, the frequency of muscle-related complaints was approximately 9%.301\n\uf06c Myalgia (without CK elevation) occurs in 5-10% of patients in clinical practice.301 If the\nsymptoms are not tolerable or are progressive, the dose of statin should be reduced, or\nthe drug stopped. \uf06c The incidence of myopathy (myositis and rhabdomyolysis) is low and is more likely to\noccur in persons with complex medical problems (especially chronic kidney disease)\nand/or who are taking multiple medications, or in elderly persons, especially women. \uf06c Creatine kinase (CK) is not routinely measured unless myositis is suspected. If the level is\nmore than 5 times the ULN on 2 occasions, the drug should be discontinued. Measurement\nshould not be done after vigorous physical exertion. \uf06c There is no uniform definition for statin intolerance. In certain trials, \u2018statin intolerant\u2019\npatients were defined as patients unable to tolerate at least two different statins because\nof unexplained skeletal muscle-related symptoms (pain, aches, weakness, or cramping)\nthat began or increased during statin therapy and symptoms improved when statin\ntherapy was discontinued.296\n\uf06c When SAMS or statin myopathy is suspected:\n\uf0d8 the first step is statin discontinuation for 2-3 weeks. \uf077 If symptoms have not resolved, it is unlikely to be statin related and the patient\nshould be continued on the same dose of statin. \uf077 If symptoms have resolved, then the following strategies may be considered:\n\uf071 Lowering the dose or decreasing the frequency to less than daily.302\n\uf071 An alternative dosing such as every other day or twice a week with atorvastatin or\nrosuvastatin303 can be used. \uf071 Treatment with the highest tolerable dose of statin in combination with a cholesterol\nabsorption inhibitor (ezetimibe)\n\uf071 If indicated, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered.304,305\n\uf06c 92% of statin intolerant patients do well with a second statin.302\n\uf06c 73% will tolerate a re-challenge with a third statin.302\n\uf06c An alternative approach is to consider co-enzyme Q10 to alleviate the symptoms of\nmyalgia. he relationship between co-enzyme Q10 and statin related muscle symptoms is\ncircumstantial.

B.3. Diabetes\n\uf06c Statins have been associated with a slight increase in dysglycemia and new-onset\ndiabetes (9-12%).313,314 It occurs with all statins and is a dose related effect. The risk is\nhigher with the more potent statins at high doses.314\n\uf06c The CV reduction benefits seen with statins far outweigh the risk of developing diabetes. In fact, statins have been proven to prevent CV events in persons with diabetes with no\novert CVD.43,69,70\n\uf06c Screening for diabetes should be considered at 6 - 12 monthly intervals in patients at high\nrisk of developing diabetes.

Neurocognitive function\n\uf06c Regulatory bodies have required that a statement be added to the drug label for all statins\nindicating that there is a potential for cognitive side-effects (such as memory loss and\nconfusion).317\n\uf06c Clinical studies designed to assess the effect of statins on cognitive function have, however,\nfound little to no evidence that statins are associated with adverse effects on memory or\ncognition or Alzheimer\u2019s disease.318-320 Furthermore, neurocognitive functions were\nextensively investigated in the Evaluating PCSK9 Binding Antibody Influence on Cognitive\nHealth in High Cardiovascular Risk Subjects (EBBINGHAUS) and no excess risk was\nobserved among patients on a statin regimen randomized to a PCSK9 inhibitor.321\nB.6. Others\n\uf06c There is no evidence that patients on statins have increased risk of non-CV mortality e.g.,\ncancers, suicides or other conditions, such as hepatic steatosis, venous thromboembolism,\natrial fibrillation, and cataracts.322-327\n\uf06c In patients with a history of prior stroke, statins clearly decreased the risk of ischemic\nstroke and major CV events.328-330 The benefit was not different among the LDL-C-low\nering strategies.330 The risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in these individuals, however,\nappears to be increased.331-333\nIII, B\nI, A\nMANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n59\n7.2.1.4.

There appears to be a dose-dependent reduction in CVD with LDL-C lowering; the\ngreater the LDL-C reduction, the greater the CV risk reduction.42,43,336,337\n\uf06c The benefits related to LDL-C reduction are not specific for statin therapy.44\n\uf06c The benefits of LDL-C lowering have been documented even in individuals whose\nbaseline levels of LDL-C are low (e.g., <1 mmol/l).42,44\n\uf06c CV risk reduction should be individualized, and this can be more specific if goals are\ndefined. The use of goals can also aid patient - doctor communication and facilitate\nadherence to treatment. \uf06c If available, plasma levels of statins may be checked for compliance. \uf06c We advocate LDL-C treatment goals and percentage LDL-C reduction.42-45,68-84\n(Table 4, pg. 26)\nMANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA\n2023\n6th Edition\n60\n7.2.2. Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors\n\uf06c Cholesterol absorption inhibitors selectively block intestinal absorption of both dietary and\nbiliary cholesterols without altering the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. This leads to a\nreduction in hepatic cholesterol delivery - a mechanism which complements the action of\nstatins. \uf06c It cab be used in combination with any dose of statin to further lower LDL-C if targets are\nnot achieved with the maximum tolerated statin dose. \uf06c Ezetimibe-statin combination therapy was found to have CV benefits in individuals with\nCKD and following vascular surgery and acute coronary syndromes.76,83,338-341\n7.2.2.1.

All these contribute to the increased CV risk seen in these\npatients. Even patients with subclinical Cushing syndrome, have been found to be at\nincreased CV risk.501\n\uf06c Dyslipidemia is a common metabolic abnormality in Cushing syndrome. Estimates for the\nprevalence of dyslipidemia in active Cushing disease ranges from 12% to 72%.502 The\ndyslipidemia in Cushing syndrome:502,503\n\uf0d8 Is characterized by elevated plasma TC and TG due to increased circulating VLDL and\nLDL particles, and variable levels of HDL-C. \uf0d8 The severity can be influenced by the severity and duration of hypercortisolemia,\npresence of diabetes, and degree of visceral obesity. \uf06c Patients who achieve successful remission of Cushing syndrome after treatment do\nexperience improvement in dyslipidemia and other CV risk factors such as obesity,\nhypertension, and diabetes. However, these risk factors persist after cure in a significant\nproportion of patients.502-505 Therefore, patients may require monitoring and treatment for\ndyslipidemia after successful biochemical remission of Cushing disease. 10.6.2.1 Management\n\uf06c In adult patients with Cushing syndrome, it is recommended to monitor lipid profile at the\ntime of diagnosis and periodically afterwards. \uf06c In adults with persistent endogenous Cushing syndrome, irrespective of the CV risk\nscore, statin therapy, as adjunct to lifestyle modification, should be considered to reduce\nCV risk.498\n\uf06c LDL-C should be the primary target of therapy.

This can significantly increase the risk of myotoxicity from\nstatin therapy. Therefore, statins not metabolized by the CYP3A4 system (including\nfluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) should be used when cholesterol-lowering\ntherapy is required in the setting of ketoconazole therapy. \uf0d8 Mitotane, commonly used in the treatment of Cushing syndrome, by itself can contribute\nto a secondary dyslipidemia.498,506\nIIa, C\nKey Message #9 :\n\uf06c Thyroid hormones have profound effects on lipoprotein metabolism. \uf06c Dyslipidemia is a common metabolic abnormality in Cushing syndrome, ranging from\n12% to 72%.

This booster inhibits CYP 450 3A and increases the effect of the statins. Therefore, statin dose should be adjusted according to the current ART and\nmedication regime. \uf071 Both simvastatin and lovastatin are extensively metabolised by the CYP 450\nsystem and thus should be avoided, especially in patients on a CYP 450\ninhibitors, such as protease inhibitors (PI). \uf077 If the patient is statin intolerant or LDL-C target has not been achieved despite\nmaximally tolerated dose, ezetimibe, +/- PCSK9 inhibitor can be considered.508,509,512\n\uf0d8 Monitoring for side effects is vital.

Fish oils is not a replacement for statins\nIII, A\nin the treatment of elevated LDL-C. Coenzyme Q10\nNo definitive evidence to support the use of\nIII, A\nCoenzyme Q10 on the reduction of cholesterol levels\nand primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.596,597\nComplementary and Alternative Therapies:\nEstrogen and\nHormone replacement is not indicated for primary\nIII, A\nProgestins\nor secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Red Yeast Rice\nRed yeast rice contains substances that are\nstructurally identical to statins. IIb, C\nUnlike statins, there is no data on its safety in long\nterm use.

The saturated fatty acids in coconut oil increase\nIIb, B\ntotal-C, LDL-C, and HDL-C.600\nOne tablespoon of coconut oil contains 12gm of\nsaturated fat and 1 tablespoon of virgin coconut oil\ncontains 13gm of saturated fat.601\nThis would contribute a significant portion of the\nrecommended total daily saturated fat limit of\n< 10% of energy. If coconut oil is used as part of a daily eating plan\nand/or in food preparation, it is recommended that\nit be used within the context of a healthy dietary\npattern.
