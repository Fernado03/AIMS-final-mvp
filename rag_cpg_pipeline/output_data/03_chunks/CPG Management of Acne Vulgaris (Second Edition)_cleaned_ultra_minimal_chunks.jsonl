Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2022 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2026) or sooner if new evidence\nbecomes available. When it is due for updating, the Chairperson of the\nCPG or National Advisor of the related speciality will be informed. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed, and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or\nomissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this\ndocument, which will be the definitive version at all times.

DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATIONS\n\u2022 Microbiological\nand\nendocrinological\ninvestigations\nmay\nbe\nperformed to rule out other conditions that may mimic acne vulgaris. ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY\n\u2022 Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale may be used for grading of\nacne severity in clinical practice. TREATMENT\na. Topical treatment\n\u2022 Topical benzoyl peroxide monotherapy or in combination with other\ntopical therapy should be given in mild to moderate acne vulgaris. \u2022 Topical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin and adapalene) monotherapy should\nbe used in non-inflammatory acne vulgaris or in combination with\nother therapies in inflammatory acne vulgaris. \u2022 Topical antibiotics (e.g. clindamycin) should not be used as\nmonotherapy in acne vulgaris to prevent bacterial resistance. \u2022 Topical azelaic acid may be used in acne vulgaris, especially in\npatients with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. \u2022 Combination topical therapy should be given in moderate acne\nvulgaris. b. Systemic treatment\n\u2022 Oral doxycycline, tetracycline or erythromycin should be used for\nmoderate to severe acne vulgaris. \uf0a1 Response to these antibiotics should be evaluated at 6 - 8 weeks. \uf0a1 Target duration of therapy should not exceed 3 - 4 months to\nreduce resistance. \u2022 Isotretinoin should be prescribed for nodulocystic or severe acne\nvulgaris and treatment-resistant moderate acne vulgaris. \uf0a1 It should only be prescribed by dermatologists. Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\niii\nc. Physical treatment\n\u2022 Chemical peels may be used as an adjunct in the treatment of acne\nvulgaris. \uf0a1 The preferred choices are salicylic acid and glycolic acid peels. COSMECEUTICALS\n\u2022 Cosmeceuticals may be used as an adjunct in the management of\nacne vulgaris. TREATMENT IN SPECIAL GROUP\na. Pregnant and lactating women\n\u2022 Hormonal therapy, tetracyclines, co-trimoxazole and isotretinoin\nshould be avoided in the treatment of acne vulgaris in pregnant and\nlactating women. b.", "chunk_order": 2}

Adolescents\n\u2022 Topical benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids (tretinoin and\nadapalene) may be used safely in adolescents with acne vulgaris. \u2022 Oral tetracycline derivatives (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline and\nminocycline) should not be used in patients aged <8 years with acne\nvulgaris. \u2022 Oral isotretinoin can be used safely in patients aged \u226512 years with\nsevere acne vulgaris. QUALITY OF LIFE\n\u2022 Assessment for quality of life may be considered in the management\nof patients with acne vulgaris. REFERRAL\n\u2022 Patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris (e.g. nodulocystic\nacne) should be referred early to a dermatologist. \u2022 Patients with acne vulgaris who exhibit suicidal behaviour should be\nreferred urgently to a psychiatrist. Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\niv\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these Clinical Practice\nGuidelines (CPG) were from the Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of\nHigher Education and private sector. There was active involvement of\na multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the electronic\ndatabases mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of Systemic\nReviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines International Network\n(refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The common\nsearch was limited to literature published on humans, all adults (19\nplus years), publications from the year \u201c2012 to Current\u201d and English\nlanguage. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched, and experts in the field were contacted to\nidentify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 29 May\n2020 to 10 Sep 2020. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 10 February 2022 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other CPGs on acne vulgaris e.g.:\n\u2022 Acne Vulgaris: Management [National Institute for Health and\nCare Excellence (NICE), 2021]\n\u2022 Acne Management Guidelines by the Dermatological Society of\nSingapore (2019)\n\u2022 Guidelines of Care for the Management of Acne Vulgaris (American\nAcademy of Dermatology, 2016)\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as\nreferences.

A total of 14 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 31 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed at each DG meeting. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the DG and\nRC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made\nby consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG was developed largely\nManagement of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\nv\nbased on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted for a month on the MoH Malaysia official\nwebsite for feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally\npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the\nHealth Technology Assessment and CPG Council MoH Malaysia for\nreview and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nAcne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous\nunits, characterised by the formation of non-inflammatory (open and\nclosed comedones) and inflammatory (papules, pustules, nodules and\ncysts) lesions. Commonly affected areas are the face and trunk, and it\nusually affects adolescents and young adults. A common misconception\nby the public is that acne vulgaris is a self-limiting teenage skin problem\nand thus, does not warrant treatment. However, it has been found to\nadversely affect the patients\u2019 social life, self-esteem and body image. It also has the potential to cause scarring in some patients and may\ncontribute to significant psychological distress, like depression and\nanxiety, if left untreated. The pathogenesis of acne vulgaris is multifactorial. Four key pathogenic\nfactors that play an important role in the development of acne\nvulgaris are increased sebum production, altered follicular keratinisation\nleading to comedones formation, follicular colonisation by Cutibacterium\nacnes (C. acnes), previously known as Propionibacterium acnes,\nand inflammation around pilosebaceous unit. There has been\nrecent evidence that microbiome and its interactions with the innate\nimmune system plays a factor in the development of acne\nvulgaris.1, level III In acne vulgaris, the resident microbiome includes\nC. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, whereas the transient\nmicrobiome includes Staphylococcus aureus. Microbial imbalance or\n\u2018dysbiosis\u2019 has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of\ninflammatory acne. The loss of balance between the different C. acnes\nphylotypes, together with dysbiosis of the skin microbiome resulted in\nacne development, rather than C. acnes hyperproliferation. The loss\nof diversity of C. acnes phylotypes acts as a trigger for innate immune\nsystem activation, leading to cutaneous inflammation. C. acnes\nphylotype IA1 predominance has been observed, with a more virulent\nprofile in acne than in normal skin. Recent studies also showed that the\ngut microbiome is involved in acne, through interactions with the skin\nmicrobiome.1, level III\nThe Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 evaluated the trend of acne\nvulgaris in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.

RISK AND AGGRAVATING FACTORS\nA number of risk and aggravating factors for acne vulgaris have\nbeen described in the literature. The studies included are those with\nacceptable quality and the results are summarised below:\na. Age\nA cross-sectional study showed that subjects aged 15 - 16 and\n17 - 18 years old groups were associated with an increased risk of\nacne (OR=2.38, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.92) and (OR=1.59, 95% CI 1.26 to\n2.01) respectively. Older adolescents (aged 17 - 18 years old) were\nsignificantly associated with acne severity.9, level III\nb. Gender\nInconsistent associations have been found between gender and\nlikelihood of acne. A local study found males are more likely to develop\nacne compared to females (OR=4.734, 95% CI 2.276 to 8.222). They\nare also found to have a higher risk of developing moderate to severe\nacne (p=0.001).8, level III\nA more recent study however found females are more likely to have\nacne compared with males with a prevalence ratio of 1.16 (95% CI 1.05\nto 1.25).10, level III\nPersonal history of acne during adolescence is associated with adult\nfemale acne (OR=5.44, 95% CI 3.43 to 8.61).11, level II-2\nc. Family history\nThe role of genetics as a risk factor for acne vulgaris has been\nproposed although the exact mode of inheritance remains unknown. A\nsignificant positive family history of acne has been demonstrated where\nacne is found in twins, mother, first degree relatives and multiple family\nmembers.5\nTwo local studies revealed that family history was associated with acne\nvulgaris among adolescents and young adults:\n\u2022 family history of acne (p<0.001)12, level II-2\n\u2022 history of acne among father (OR=1.852, 95% CI 1.072 to 3.201),\nmother (OR=1.752, 95% CI 1.058 to 2.902) and both parents\n(OR=3.056, 95% CI 1.153 to 8.094)8, level III\nIn addition, a case-control study showed a history of acne in firstdegree relatives of either parent (OR=3.02, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.06) or\nsiblings (OR=2.40, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.94) was also associated with adult\nfemale acne.11, level II-2\nManagement of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\nHowever, family history was not found to be an aggravating factor for\nacne severity.8-9, level III\nd.

A cohort study showed diet of patients with acne vulgaris had significantly\nhigher glycaemic load value (175 \u00b1 35) compared with those without\nacne (122 \u00b1 28).

Untreated or\npoorly-treated acne may result in scars (hypertrophic, keloid, ice-pick,\nboxcar and rolling scars). Investigations are rarely needed in the diagnosis of acne vulgaris. They\nare only required to rule out other diseases which may be associated with\nacne e.g. polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), Cushing\u2019s syndrome or\nandrogen-secreting tumour. Microbiology and/or endocrinology testing\nmay be offered to exclude these conditions and discussed below.

Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\n4. ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY\nThere are two broad approaches to the assessment of acne severity\nwhich are global acne severity grading and lesion counting. Both have\nsome subjectivity involved. More objective methods for assessing the\nseverity of acne vulgaris include photography and advanced imaging\ntechnologies.19, level III\nThere are at least 25 different acne severity grading systems,\ncomprising of both global grading and lesion counting.19, level III Global\nseverity gradings are usually based on comparisons of descriptive\ntexts or photographic standards. For acne lesion counting method, the\nnumber of NIL (open and closed comedones), IL (papules, pustules\nand nodules) and total lesions (TL) are counted. Currently, there is no\nuniversally accepted grading system for acne.17\nThe South-East Asia Study Alliance (SASA) adopts the American\nAcademy of Dermatology Acne Consensus Conference (ACC) grading\nsystem for acne severity. The ACC classification of acne severity is based\non the number and types of lesions, which is further classified into three\ngroups, which are mild, moderate and severe.20 The Dermatological\nSociety of Singapore18 and the first edition of Malaysian MoH CPG\non Management of Acne5 advocate the use of Comprehensive Acne\nSeverity Scale (CASS) for evaluating acne severity. CASS [modification\nof an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of Acne Severity] is a\nvalidated tool. It correlates strongly with the Leeds technique for face\n(r=0.82), chest (r=0.85) and back (r=0.87).5 It is also simple to use in\nclinical practice. In a clinical research setting, lesion counting is better suited than grading. Counts can distinguish between even small differences in therapeutic\nresponse. The reliability of lesion counting has been evaluated and\nshown intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.68 for NIL, 0.72\nfor IL and 0.65 for global grading. For intra-rater reliability, the ICCs\nare 0.83, 0.79 and 0.69 for NIL, IL and global grading respectively.", "chunk_order": 14}

Factors that have\nbeen implicated as a higher risk for relapse include severe seborrhoea,\nyoung age, family history of acne, prepubertal acne and truncal\nacne.44, level III\nAcne flare may occur after starting oral isotretinoin. Consider adding\na short course of oral prednisolone to reduce the inflammation.52\nPrednisone can be given in doses of 0.5 - 1 mg/kg/day to prevent the\nsystemic and cutaneous manifestations of isotretinoin-induced acne\nfulminans-like eruptions.17 It can be tapered slowly over 4 - 6 weeks. Isotretinoin is highly lipophilic and is best absorbed when taken with\nfood. Patients should be instructed to take isotretinoin with meals.17\nAEs includes mucocutaneous (cheilitis, xerosis, erythema, pruritus,\ndesquamation, dryness of nasal mucosa, epistaxis, worsening or\ntriggering atopic dermatitis and telogen effluvium), musculoskeletal\n(arthralgia and muscular cramps) and ophthalmic (dry eyes and\ninflammation of the eyelids) systems. With standard courses, these\nAEs are temporary and resolve without sequelae after discontinuation\nof the drug.17\nThe causal link between isotretinoin and depression is controversial\nwith rates ranging from 1 - 11%, which are similar with the rates in oral\nantibiotic control groups. Patients should be screened for symptoms of\ndepression before and during treatment.18\nManagement of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\nLiver function tests and serum lipids should be checked before and 6 -\n8 weeks after medication initiation or earlier if necessary.18 Laboratory\nabnormalities include elevations of serum aspartate, alanine\ntransaminases and hypertriglycerides which all return to normal after\ndiscontinuation of therapy.5\nIsotretinoin is a teratogenic drug and should not be used in female\npatients who are or may become pregnant. Contraception should be\ndiscussed with the patients when considering isotretinoin. Female\npatients who can become pregnant must be on contraception while on\nisotretinoin and until one month after discontinuation of the treatment. There is an extremely high risk that severe birth defects may result\nif pregnancy occurs while taking isotretinoin. These include external\nabnormalities e.g. skull abnormality, ear abnormalities (anotia,\nmicropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), eye abnormality\n(microphthalmia), facial dysmorphia and cleft palate.

Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\nIn a systematic review, an RCT compared 20% SA plus 10% MA\nand 35% GA peel applied every two weeks for six sessions in mild\nto moderate acne vulgaris. The combination peel was significantly\nmore effective than GA peel in reducing total acne score, comedones,\npapules and pustules. There was no significant difference between\nthese two intervention groups in burning or stinging sensations, skin\ndryness and acne flare-up. However, the combination induced more\nvisible desquamation (RR=2.00, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.57).61, level I\nA split-face RCT using various combination of peels grouped into three\ncomparisons on mild to moderate acne vulgaris patients with Fitzpatrick\nskin type III and IV demonstrated better effectiveness in combination\npeel than single peel as shown below:66, level I\n\u2022 Modified JS plus 20% TCA vs 30% TCA\n\uf0a1 reduction in MAS score (p=0.0001) and sustained on followup (p=0.001)\n\uf0a1 more favourable patient satisfaction (p=0.004)\n\u2022 20% SA plus 10% MA mixture vs 30% SA\n\uf0a1 reduction in MAS score (p=0.006)\n\uf0a1 more favourable patient satisfaction (p=0.009)\nIn the third comparison, there was no significant difference between\nModified JS plus TCA 20% vs 20% SA plus 10% MA mixture in MAS\nscore and patient satisfaction.

The modalities include light\ntherapy, laser and radiofrequency (RF) devices. Examples of light\ntherapies are photodynamic therapy (PDT), intense pulsed light (IPL),\nblue light, red light, mixed blue-red light and cool white light. Laser has\nbeen an established treatment for acne scar. However, at present, there\nis an increased usage of laser therapy in the treatment of active acne. They include erbium glass laser, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium\ngarnet (Nd:YAG), pulsed dye laser (PDL) and non-ablative fractional\nlaser (NAFL). Another recent modality that has been used to treat\nactive acne is RF device which utilises electric current to generate heat\ninstead of optical sources like laser and light devices. Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\n7.4.1 Light-based therapy\na. Visible light sources\ni. Blue light therapy\nBlue light therapy has a shorter wavelength (407 - 420 nm) compared\nwith red light. It has a bactericidal effect on C. acnes via excitation of\nbacterial porphyrins (coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin IX) leading\nto the release of singlet oxygen and reactive free radicals. A meta-analysis on 14 RCTs involving 698 participants evaluated the\neffectiveness and safety of blue light therapy in mild to severe acne\nvulgaris. The blue light was compared with placebo, topical agents (e.g. retinoids, BPO or antibiotics), oral antibiotics or isotretinoin. There was\nno difference in:\n\uf0a1 mean number of NIL at weeks 4, 8 and 10 - 12 with overall MD of\n3.47 (95% CI -0.76 to 7.71)\n\uf0a1 mean number of IL at weeks 4, 8 and 10 - 12 with overall MD of\n0.16 (95% CI -0.99 to 1.31)\nIn terms of safety, AEs were generally mild and favoured blue light or\ndid not significantly differ between groups. They were skin irritation,\nerythema, dryness, tightness, peeling, itching, burning, acne flare-ups\nand changes in pigmentation. Most of the trials in the meta-analysis\nwere small, of short duration (<12 weeks) and with high risk of\nbias.67, level I\nii. Red light therapy\nRed light with a wavelength of 630 - 640 nm can penetrate deeper\ntissues e.g. sebaceous gland and stimulate macrophages to release\nvarious cytokines. This can lead to anti-inflammatory reaction and\npromote skin repair. A recent large meta-analysis of 13 RCTs involving 422 participants\nwith moderate to severe acne vulgaris on red light vs placebo and\ncombinations of red light with aminolevulinic acid (ALA), methyl\naminolevulinate (MAL), blue light, topical 1% SA and fractional erbium\nglass laser showed no significant difference in IL and NIL counts.", "chunk_order": 40}

COSMECEUTICALS\nCosmeceuticals refers to cosmetics that contain non-medicinal\ningredients which are able to elicit functional effects on the skin. The\nterm cosmeceuticals is used interchangeably with dermocosmetics\nand they are non-prescription items. In acne vulgaris, cosmeceuticals\ntargets various etiopathogenic factors by having antibacterial,\nanti-inflammatory and sebum controlling properties. Examples of\ncosmeceuticals include cleansers, moisturisers and sunscreen. These\nproducts contain a wide variety of ingredients which can be classified\ninto corneolytics, sebum controller with anti-inflammatory properties,\nanti-bacterials and anti-oxidants. 8.1 Cosmeceutical Products\na. Cleanser\nCleansers are used to remove makeup, oil, dirt, dead skin cells and\nbacteria. They improve acne by removing the hair follicle plugs and\npreventing the obstruction of hair follicles. Cleansers come in various\nforms e.g. gels, liquids or creams which can be highly foaming or\nrinseable. In patients with oily acne-prone skin, gentle cleansers that\nare easily rinsed are generally preferred.

Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\n11. COMPLICATIONS\nAcne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes\nnot only profound psychosocial impact but also clinically relevant\nsequelae, e.g. post-acne erythema (PAE), PIH and scarring. Acne and\nacne-related complications can have detrimental impacts on the QoL\nand lead to feelings of embarrassment and low self-esteem. These\ncomplications are frequently considered cosmetically unacceptable\nand can have a lasting impact on the patients. \u2022 Post-acne erythema\nPAE is a common sequelae of acne vulgaris.

QUALITY OF LIFE\nAcne vulgaris is a chronic disease that may result in profound negative\npsychological and social effects on the quality of life (QoL) of the\npatients. Due to the visibility of acne and the potential to cause scarring\nin some patients, significant psychological distress may develop if acne\nvulgaris is left untreated. There are various tools available for the assessment of QoL in patients\nwith acne vulgaris, which can be divided into general and acne specific\nassessment tools. Examples of a general assessment tool is DLQI and\nacne specific tools are CADI (refer to Appendix 8) and Acne Quality of\nLife (AQOL). \u2022 Acne vulgaris can affect QoL and the assessment tools which can\nbe used are DLQI, CADI and AQOL. a.", "chunk_order": 56}

Impairment of QoL\nIn a local study on mild to severe acne vulgaris patients in a dermatology\nclinic, CADI score was related to depression (p=0.012), anxiety\n(p=0.015) and stress (p=0.001).119, level III\nA cross-sectional study conducted locally in secondary schools\nassessing the perception and psychosocial impact of acne vulgaris\namong students using the CADI showed that the majority had mild\nQoL impairment based on CADI score with a mean of 3.5\u00b12.5. When individual CADI domain with score \u22651 was analysed, 79.5%\nperceived acne as a problem, 76.4% were concerned, depressed and\nfelt miserable while 69.4% had some degree of feeling aggressive,\nfrustrated and embarrassed due to acne vulgaris.6, level III\nIn another cross-sectional study on students with mild to severe acne\nvulgaris using different tools, perceived stigma was associated with\nhealth-related QoL (p<0.001), psychological distress (p<0.001) and\nsomatic symptoms (p<0.001).120, level III\nThere is increasing evidence regarding the role of difficulties in emotion\nregulation (DER) in acne vulgaris patients, thus psychological wellbeing assessment is recommended. A cross-sectional study showed\nthat DER was significantly higher in acne vulgaris patients than controls. It was also associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms based on\nthe Hospital Anxiety and Depressive scale (p<0.01) and impaired QoL\nbased on AQOL (p<0.01).121, level III\nIn a recent large meta-analysis of 42 observational studies, acne\nvulgaris was significantly correlated with depression (r=0.22, 95% CI\nManagement of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\n0.17 to 0.26) and anxiety (r= 0.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.31).122, level II-2 There\nwas no report on the quality of primary papers. b.

Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\n13. REFERRAL\nThe urgency for referral of patients with acne vulgaris is divided into the\nfollowing categories:5\n\u2022 urgent: within 24 hours\n\u2022 seen early: within 2 weeks\n\u2022 non-urgent: based on available appointment date\na. Urgent referral\nRefer patients urgently to a dermatologist if the patient is suspected to\nhave acne fulminans.52 Acne fulminans is a rare skin disorder. It presents\nas an acute, painful, ulcerating, and haemorrhagic form of acne and,\nmay be associated with systemic symptoms e.g. fever and polyarthritis. It may also cause bone lesions and laboratory abnormalities. Urgent referral to a psychiatrist should also be made if the patient has\nmajor depression or exhibiting suicidal behaviour.5, 52\nb.

Management of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\n14. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe implementation of this CPG is the responsibility of the healthcare\nproviders. The management of acne vulgaris should be guided by\nevidence-based approach in order to provide safe and optimum care\nfor the patients. The following are the factors that may influence the\nimplementation of the recommendations in this CPG:\n14.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing this CPG are:\ni. wide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to\nhealthcare providers\nii. annual dermatology update course for primary care doctors\nThe limiting factors in the implementation are:\ni. availability and cost of treatment\nii. variation in treatment practice and preferences\n14.2 Potential Resource Implications\nAcne vulgaris may be seen as not important compared with other\nmedical diseases and thus not given priority in provision of medications\nas recommended by the CPG. It has to be noted that, as emphasised\nby the CPG, inadequately treated acne vulgaris may lead to various\nphysical and psychological complications that affect QoL of the patients. Assessment of the severity of acne vulgaris is important as it determines\nthe appropriate medications to be prescribed. The use of assessment\ntool e.g. CASS requires training to the healthcare providers. This may\ncause small resource implication. Another important issue related to\nresource implication is the availability of recommended treatment\nin the healthcare facilities. It has to be pointed out that even simple\nmedications like topical BPO which is strongly recommended in CPG is\nnot easily available in the health clinic. To enhance the utilisation of this CPG on Management of Acne Vulgaris\n(Second Edition), the following clinical audit indicators for quality\nmanagement are proposed:\nPercentage of\npatients with mild\nto moderate acne\nvulgaris treated\nwith topical BPO\nas monotherapy\nor in combination\nwith other topical\ntherapy\n=\nTotal number of patients with mild to\nmoderate acne vulgaris in the same period\nNumber of patients with mild to moderate acne\nvulgaris treated with topical BPO as\nmonotherapy or in combination with other\ntopical therapy in a period\nx100%\nManagement of Acne Vulgaris (Second Edition)\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of\nthe CPG by MoH which include launching of the CPG, Quick Reference\nand Training Module.", "chunk_order": 59}
