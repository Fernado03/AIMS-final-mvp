Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2019 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2023) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When\nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

Diagnosis and Investigation\n\u2022 Consider rheumatoid arthritis if inflammation involving multiple joints\nis present for at least six weeks. \u2022 Inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor \u00b1 anti-citrullinated\npeptide antibody should be tested when there is clinical suspicion of\nrheumatoid arthritis. Referral\n\u2022 All patients suspected of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should be\nreferred to the rheumatologist. \u2022 All RA patients should be primarily managed by rheumatologists. \uf0a1 Co-management plan with primary healthcare providers may be\noffered subsequently. Treatment\n\u2022 Aim to achieve a state of clinical remission or at least low disease\nactivity within six months using a treat-to-target strategy in rheumatoid\narthritis. \u2022 Patient education should be included in the management of\nrheumatoid arthritis. \u2022 Short term low-dose corticosteroids may be used in active rheumatoid\narthritis. \u2022 Methotrexate should be used as the first-line Disease Modifying\nAnti-Rheumatic Drug in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis unless\ncontraindicated.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary\nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed\nand Guidelines International Network (G-I-N). Refer to Appendix 1 for\nExample of Search Strategy. The inclusion criteria were all patients\nwith rheumatoid arthritis regardless of study design. The search was\nlimited to literature published in the last 15 years and on humans and\nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify\nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 29 May 2017 to 2\nJune 2017. Literature search was repeated for all clinical questions at\nthe end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers\npublished before 31 January 2019 to be included. Future CPG updates\nwill consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details\nof the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG\nSecretariat.", "chunk_order": 2}

A total of seven main clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG members met 19 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis\niv\nThe literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It\nwas also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from\nany interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for CPG, and the Health Technology Assessment\n(HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune\ndisease which primarily affects the joints. It is characterised by\nuncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue and a wide array of\nmultisystem co-morbidities. The disease has an insidious onset\nwith unpredictable and variable courses. Typically, RA manifests\nas symmetrical polyarthritis but may also present with non-specific\nsymptoms e.g. fatigue, malaise and mild fever. Bone erosion,\ndestruction of cartilage and complete loss of joint integrity can occur\nover time if treatment is delayed or inadequate. Numerous multicentre international studies have shown that disease\nprogression can be minimised with early and appropriate treatment. Treatment paradigm of RA has evolved over the last two decades with\nthe advent of biologics and implementation of treat-to-target (T2T)\nstrategy. The Malaysian National Inflammatory Arthritis Registry (NIAR) reported\nthat there is often a delay in RA diagnosis as only about 50% of cases\nare diagnosed within a year of the symptom onset. This may be due to\na lack of awareness and understanding of the disease among public\nand healthcare providers. Furthermore, limited human, financial and\ninfrastructure resources may also contribute to the difficulty of accessing\nrheumatology care.4\nThis is the first national CPG on the management of RA aimed to\nincrease awareness among healthcare providers on the importance of\nrecognizing early RA, timely referral to rheumatologist and initiation of\ntreatment. We hope that this CPG will foster close collaboration between\nvarious stakeholders in providing evidence-based management of RA\nto improve outcomes and ultimately patients\u2019 quality of life (QoL). Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis\n2. CLINICAL FEATURES\nClinical features of RA can be divided into articular and extra-articular\nmanifestations. Extra-articular features may involve multiple organs\nincluding the skin, eyes, lungs and blood vessels. Non-specific systemic\nfeatures such as fever, malaise and weight loss may precede overt joint\nsymptoms. RA may be associated with other connective tissue diseases and chronic\nnon inflammatory pain e.g. fibromyalgia. It is also an independent risk\nfactor for cardiovascular (CV) diseases and osteoporosis. The key presenting symptoms of joint inflammation are:\n\u2022 joint pain and swelling\n\u2022 early morning stiffness lasting \u226530 minutes\nThe typical articular pattern of RA is symmetrical polyarthritis affecting:\n\u2022 metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints\n\u2022 proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints\n\u2022 interphalangeal joint of thumbs\n\u2022 wrists\n\u2022 elbows\n\u2022 metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints\nThe symptoms of joint inflammation should be present for at least six\nweeks.", "chunk_order": 6}

TREATMENT\nOptimal care of patients with RA consists of an integrated approach that\nincludes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments\n(refer to Algorithm 2). Pharmacological treatment should be initiated\nas soon as RA diagnosis is made to preserve joint function and QoL. Successful treatment in RA is determined using outcome measures. Although they were originally used in the field of research, the\ndevelopment of effective RA treatment had promoted their use\nin clinical practice. There are many validated outcome measures\nreflecting various RA manifestations such as the underlying disease\nprocess, level of discomfort and disability, and organ damage (refer to\nAppendix 3). The use of these outcome measures allows standardised\nobjective assessments of RA disease activity, which in turn drives\ntreatment decisions. \u2022\nTreatment goals in RA include:\n\uf0a1 pain relief and control of inflammation\n\uf0a1 preservation of joint function and QoL\n\uf0a1 minimising systemic complications and managing co-morbidities\n\u2022\nTreat-to-target (T2T) treatment strategy, formulated in 2010, has\nresulted in better disease outcomes. It includes:23\n\uf0a1 a defined treatment target (clinical remission or at least low\ndisease activity)\n\uf0a1 shared decision making\n\uf0a1 assessment of disease activity\n\uf0a1 regular adjustment of treatment\nRecommendation 4\n\u2022\nAim to achieve a state of clinical remission or at least low disease\nactivity within six months using a treat-to-target treatment strategy*\nin rheumatoid arthritis. *Refer to preceding yellow box\n7.1 Non-Pharmacological Treatment\n7.1.1 Patient Education\nPatient education is an important non-pharmacological component in\nthe management of RA.

RHEUMATOLOGY NURSE-LED CARE\nThe escalating demand for rheumatology care has extended the role\nof nurses in addressing unmet management needs of patients with RA. In some countries, rheumatology nurse-led care was established to\nenhance follow-up care for patients with RA, which includes monitoring\nof laboratory results, assessment of disease activity, patient education\nand psychosocial support. The effectiveness of nurse-led care in rheumatology was reported in three\nsystematic reviews.

MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP\nMany drugs used in the treatment of RA have potential side-effects\nand may aggravate co-morbidities associated with the underlying\ndisease. Combination of DMARDs are often needed to control disease\nactivity and this may pose a greater risk for AEs. Hence, an integral\npart in the management of RA include the healthcare provider\u2019s\nunderstanding of the safety profiles of each therapy and vigilance in\nmonitoring for potential harms to patients. Nurse- and/or pharmacy-led\npatient counselling on the importance of routine laboratory tests and\nrecognition of adverse symptoms may enable early detection of drug\ntoxicity and appropriate action to be taken to minimise harm. An overview of laboratory abnormalities of each drug and a summary of\ncurrent guidelines for laboratory monitoring as well as recommendation\non frequency of monitoring is provided in the Appendix 7. 12. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality\nhealthcare services based on the best and most recent available\nevidence applied to local scenario. Various factors and resource\nimplications should be considered for the success of the uptake in the\nCPG recommendations. 12.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:\n1. availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies)\n2. conferences and updates on management of RA including\nthose involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian Society of\nRheumatology)\n3. Key Performance Indicator on Rheumatology Services monitored\nby MoH (i.e. screening for viral hepatitis on RA patients prior to\nstarting MTX)\n4. related registries - Malaysian NIAR (myNIAR) and Malaysian\nRheumatology Biologics Registry (MARBLE)\n5. public awareness during World Arthritis Day\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n1. limited awareness and knowledge in management of RA among\nhealthcare providers\n2. insufficient resources in RA care e.g. expertise, diagnostic tests\nand medications\n3. poor access to rheumatology services\n4.", "chunk_order": 26}

If untreated, the inflammation may damage\ncartilage and bone. \u2022 The commonly affected joints are the small joints of the hands\nand feet but other joints like shoulders, elbows, knees and\nankles may also be affected. \u2022 In some people, RA may also affect other parts of the body\nincluding the eyes, lungs and blood vessels. Other associated\nsymptoms include fatigue and mild fever. II. Causes\n\u2022 RA is caused by a problem in the immune system, unlike\nosteoarthritis which is usually caused by \u2018wear and tear\u2019. \u2022 The exact cause of RA is still unclear but certain factors are\nthought to increase the risk of developing it:\n\uf0a1 environment - e.g. infection\n\uf0a1 genes - the chance of developing RA is partly genetic\n\uf0a1 hormones - women are more likely to have RA\n\uf0a1 lifestyle - smoking cigarettes can double the risk of\ndeveloping RA\nIII. Diagnosis\n\u2022 There is no single test to diagnose RA. The diagnosis is made\nbased on symptoms, physical examination, x-rays and/or\nultrasound and blood tests.

Types of medications commonly prescribed:\n\u2022 NSAIDs to relieve joint pain and swelling\n\u2022 DMARDs to treat joint inflammation and slow the disease process;\nused long-term\n\u2022 corticosteroids to treat joint inflammation; used short-term\n\u2022 biologics and targeted DMARDs when DMARDs are not effective\nor not tolerated\nTreatment is individualised and not all medications work for everyone.

Your\ndoctor will monitor for any possible side effects from medications and\nadjust treatment as needed. It is important to adhere to your clinic\nappointments and treatment for optimal management of your RA. Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis\nC. Lifestyle Modification\nLifestyle modification is also important to improve RA symptoms and\nQoL. By staying active, eating well and limiting stress, overall health\ncan be optimised. I. Physical activity\n\u2022 It is best to rest the joint when it is acutely inflamed (painful\nand swollen). \u2022 Regular, gentle exercises can be done once inflammation\nhas resolved. This will improve joint flexibility and general\nwell-being. They include:\n\uf0a1 low impact aerobic exercises e.g. line dancing, wateraerobic\n\uf0a1 strengthening exercises e.g. walking, swimming, stationary\ncycling\n\uf0a1 stretching and range-of-motion exercises e.g. tai chi, yoga\nII. Daily tasks\nYou may need to make some adaptations to your daily tasks\nto make it safer and easier to be performed. Some examples\ninclude:\n\u2022 At home\n\uf0a1 change door knobs to lever type\n\uf0a1 replace squatting toilets with sitting toilets\n\uf0a1 place regularly used items on reachable shelves\n\uf0a1 replace heavy appliances with lighter ones\n\u2022 At work\n\uf0a1 arrange the workspace to make it easier to complete tasks\nwith the least amount of physical strain\n\uf0a1 take breaks from repetitive motion tasks\nIII. Healthy eating\nThere is no specific diet that improves or worsens RA. A healthy\nand well-balanced diet is important to maintain a healthy\nweight and prevent other diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus and\nheart disease. In general, a healthy dietary habit includes the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 consume more fresh fruits and vegetables\n\u2022 reduce sugar and salt\n\u2022 avoid processed food and high saturated fat diet\n\u2022 if you drink alcohol, do so in moderation; some people on\ncertain RA medications may need to avoid alcohol completely\nIV. Emotional health\nLiving with RA can be a challenge. It is normal to feel angry or\nfrustrated because tasks that used to be done routinely may\nnow be difficult. Emotional stress may make it harder to deal\nwith pain. Some steps that you can take to understand and\ncontrol your emotional health include:\n\u2022 avoid things that cause you stress e.g. make changes to\nyour daily routine to reduce physical strain\nManagement of Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\u2022 make time for things that you enjoy e.g. listening to music\n\u2022 find positive ways to cope with stress e.g. joining a support\ngroup\n\u2022 learn relaxation techniques e.g. deep breathing technique\nV.", "chunk_order": 36}

Smoking\nSmoking is one of the poor prognostic factors for RA. Cessation\nof smoking is advisable in view of its association with high CV\nrisk. Talk to a health care worker if you are experiencing symptoms of\ndepression, having relationship problems or facing sleep difficulties. Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis\nAPPENDIX 5\nPRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION\nThe purpose of joint protection is to allow patients to participate in daily\nactivities with the least amount of damage to the affected joints. These\nprinciples can help to reduce pain, inflammation and injury caused by\nexcessive stress on the joint. The Principles of Joint Protection:\n1. Respect pain\nThere are many activity-related factors influencing the onset and\nintensity of joint pain. Time - the length of time one spends on an activity can influence\npain; e.g. pain resulting from five minutes of an activity may be\nmanageable, but an hour of the same task may result in pain that\nlasts for a few days. Weight - weight can influence pain in several ways; e.g. carrying a\nlighter bag of groceries a few times may not cause any difficulties\nbut a heavier bag can cause or worsen pain in the affected joint. Repetition - repetition of an activity can cause or worsen pain;\ne.g. stapling a few sheets of paper may not cause any pain, but\nrepeating this activity 50 times may cause significant pain that\nlingers for hours or days. 2. Distribute the load over stronger joints and/or larger surface areas\nSmall hand joints are vulnerable to pain and inflammation when\noverused, causing overstretching of ligaments leading to instability\n(a). When possible, spread the load over several joints or to a larger\njoint (b). (a)\n(b)\nManagement of Rheumatoid Arthritis\nPoor posture\nGood posture\n3. Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods\nJoints kept in one position for prolonged periods of time are inclined\nto get stiff. Immobilisation of a joint for days or weeks can lead to\nmuscle atrophy and joint contractures. Shifting weight, stretching or\nchanging positions frequently can alleviate the pain and stiffness. 4. Use good posture and body mechanics\nEach joint should be used in its most anatomically stable and\nfunctional plane. Good body mechanics and posture are important\nto minimise musculoskeletal strain, thereby preventing or reducing\npain. While it takes more energy initially, once it becomes a habit,\nless energy is needed to maintain a good posture.", "chunk_order": 37}
