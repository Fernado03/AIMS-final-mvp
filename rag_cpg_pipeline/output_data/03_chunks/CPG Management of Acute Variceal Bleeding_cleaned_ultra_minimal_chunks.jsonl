The information sources and search was carried out using PubMed, Ovid and\nother search engines using \u2018variceal bleeding\u2019, \u2018oesophageal varices\u2019, \u2018gastric\nvarices\u2019, \u2018variceal bleeding AND therapy\u2019, \u2018variceal bleeding AND prophylaxis\u2019\nas keywords and included not only randomised clinical trials or meta-analyses,\nbut also other relevant articles. The recommendations were formulated based\non a systematic review of current medical literature, taking into consideration\nlocal practice and feedbacks from members of MSGH, general practitioners,\nphysicians and general surgeons during the Annual Scientific Meeting and the\nMSGH Clinical meeting. Where there is lack of evidence, the recommendation\nwas based on expert opinions, and adapting other international guidelines on\nAcute Variceal Bleeding and the Proceedings of the Fourth Baveno International\nConsensus Workshop on Portal Hypertension. The draft guideline was posted on the Ministry of Health Malaysia website for\ncomment and feedback.

INTRODUCTION\nGastroesophageal variceal bleeding accounts for 10-30% of upper\ngastrointestinal haemorrhage and is a major cause of death in patients with\ncirrhosis.1 The prevalence of oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis\nvaries from 24-81%.2-5 At the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis, oesophageal varices\nare present in about 60% of decompensated and 30% of compensated patients.6\nVariceal bleeding accounts for 6.4% of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in\nMalaysia.7 Fifteen percent (105/699) of emergency endoscopy for upper\ngastrointestinal bleeding performed in Selayang Hospital are due to acute\nvariceal bleeding (unpublished data). The aetiology of cirrhosis in Malaysia is\nmainly due to hepatitis B or alcohol.8 The majority of patients who presented\nwith variceal bleeding are Chinese followed by Indians. 2. BACKGROUND\n2.1\nOesophageal Varices\nPortal hypertension leads to the development of portosystemic collaterals\nincluding gastroesophageal varices. The hepatic venous pressure gradient\n(HVPG), defined as the difference between the wedged/occluded hepatic\nvenous pressure and the free hepatic venous pressure, is the most commonly\nused parameter to measure portal pressure. The HVPG threshold for the\ndevelopment of varices is 10mmHg (normal HVPG < 5mmHg). However, not\nall patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient above this level have\noesophageal varices.9 Although the measurement of HVPG is reliable and is a\nuseful adjunct, the procedure is invasive and thus is not widely used in clinical\npractice. It is estimated that the annual risk of developing \u2018de novo\u2019 varices after initial\ndiagnosis of cirrhosis is about 5-8% per year.10,11 The appearance of\noesophageal varices has some correlation with the severity of liver disease\nand portosystemic shunting as well as continued alcohol abuse.12-14 In alcoholic\nliver disease, continued abstinence from alcohol may result in a decreasing\nsize or even disappearance of varices. Abstainers have a significantly higher\nsurvival rate and a decrease probability of bleeding.

Varices\nincrease in size from small to large at an annual rate of 10-15%.11 Despite the\nhigh occurrence of varices in cirrhotic patients, only 30% of patients with varices\nwill experience variceal haemorrhage.4,5 The risk of bleeding appears to be\ngreatest within the first year after diagnosis. Mortality of the first bleeding episode\nis high and ranges between 30% and 50% within 6 weeks;19 mortality from\nuncontrolled bleeding in the first instance is between 5-8%.20 The risk factors\nfor the first episode of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients include the severity\nof the liver dysfunction, the size of the varices (large greater than small), and\nthe presence of endoscopic red wale signs.4,17,21 Another important risk factor\nto consider is the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). It is now well\naccepted that variceal bleeding will not occur if the HVPG is below 12mmHg.22\nOnce this 12mmHg HVPG threshold is crossed, bleeding is expected to occur\nat some point. Patients who survived the first bleed from oesophageal varices are at a\nsignificant risk of recurrent haemorrhage: 70% of patients will experience\nrecurrent haemorrhage and about a third of further bleeding episodes are\nfatal.4,23 Up to fifty percent of recurrent haemorrhage occurs within the first 6\nweeks after the index bleed.20 The risk of re-bleeding is highest during the first\nfive days, decreases slowly over the first 6 weeks, and becomes virtually equal\nto that before the index bleed after the sixth week.19 Risk factors predictive of\nre-bleeding include the degree of hepatic decompensation, age greater than\n60, severity of initial bleed, renal insufficiency, level of portal pressure, size of\nvarices, active bleeding at the time of initial endoscopy and the presence of\nhepatoma.20,23\nRecommendation for classification of oesophageal varices\nThe Japanese classification is the preferred grading scale for the staging\nof oesophageal varices. (Grade C)\n2.2\nGastric Varices\nGastric varices account for approximately 20-30% of cases of variceal bleeding. The prevalence of gastric varices in patients with portal hypertension varies\nfrom 6-78% and approximately 25% of gastric varices bleed during lifetime.24\nPrimary gastric varices are varices detected at the time of the first endoscopy,\nwhereas, secondary gastric varices are those which occur within two years of\neradication of oesophageal varices. Gastric varices occur five times more often\nin patients with oesophageal varices that have previously bled than in those\nthat have never bled. Although gastric variceal haemorrhage occurs less\nfrequently than oesophageal variceal haemorrhage, the severity of bleeding\nand mortality, especially with fundal varices, is greater.25\nThe preferred classification of gastric varices is based on location, size and\nendoscopic features of the varices:24,26 gastro-oesophageal varices (GOV) and\nisolated gastric varices (IGV). GOV extend beyond the gastro-oesophageal\njunction (OGJ) and are always associated with oesophageal varices.", "chunk_order": 4}

GOV extend beyond the gastro-oesophageal\njunction (OGJ) and are always associated with oesophageal varices. They are\nfurther subdivided into Type 1 (GOV I): these varices are a continuation of\noesophageal varices and extend for 2-5 cm below the OGJ along the lesser\ncurvature of the stomach. Type 2 (GOV II): these varices extend below the\nOGJ towards the fundus of the stomach. Gastric varices in the absence of\noesophageal varices are termed isolated gastric varices (IGV). Depending on\nthe location, they are subdivided into Type 1 (IGV I): these are located in the\nfundus of the stomach and fall short of the cardia by a few centimetres. Type 2\n(IGV II): these include isolated ectopic varices and can present anywhere in\nthe stomach. 3. PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS\n3.1\nOesophageal Varices\nPrimary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is therapy given to patients with known\nvarices to prevent the first episode of variceal haemorrhage. Given the high\nrisk of initial haemorrhage and the high rate of mortality from the first bleeding\nepisode, strategies for prevention of the first bleed are therefore important. 3.1.1 Pharmacological Therapy for Oesophageal Varices\nNon-selective \u00df-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol and nadolol are\nwidely used in the prevention of the initial bleeding episode. Non-selective\nrather than selective beta-blockers are more appropriate as blocking \u00df1 activity\ncauses splanchnic vasoconstriction (by means of reflex \u00e1-adrenergic receptors)\nand by eliminating \u00df2-receptor mediated splanchnic arterial vasodilation,\nsplanchnic blood flow is reduced. Beta-blockers have been shown by 3 meta-analyses to statistically reduce the\nrelative risk of bleeding by approximately 45% with a trend towards reducing\nmortality.27-29 The average number of patients that are needed to treat to prevent\none bleeding episode is 11. The benefit of beta-blockers has been proven in\npatients with moderate or large varices (>5mm), either with good or poor liver\nfunction.11 Although beta-blocker prophylaxis reduced the rate of variceal\nbleeding in patients with small oesophageal varices,30 there is insufficient\nevidence to support treatment of patients with small varices. Beta-blockers\nhave also been shown to prevent bleeding from portal hypertensive\ngastropathy.31\nA cost-effectiveness analysis in the USA supports the use of propranolol as\ncost-effective in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.32 Beta-blocker\ntherapy should be maintained for life as bleeding may occur after stopping\ntreatment.33 However, the side-effect profile for beta-blocker therapy is\nconsiderable: 15-25% of cirrhotic patients are intolerant or have\ncontraindications to beta-blockers that preclude its use.34\nOther pharmacological alternatives which have been evaluated include nitrates. Although nitrates have been shown to reduce portal pressure, it can potentially\nworsen the vasodilative haemodynamics typically found in cirrhotic patients.", "chunk_order": 5}

Although nitrates have been shown to reduce portal pressure, it can potentially\nworsen the vasodilative haemodynamics typically found in cirrhotic patients. Nitrates were ineffective to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with\ncontraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers and should not be used as\nmonotherapy to prevent the index variceal bleed.34 Furthermore, a comparative\nstudy between isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) with propranolol for the prevention\nof variceal bleeding showed a higher long-term mortality in patients over 50\nyears of age receiving ISMN.35 It has been suggested that the higher mortality\nobserved when nitrates was compared to beta-blockers were probably due to\na beneficial effect of beta-blockers rather than a real detrimental effect of nitrates.36\nRecommendations for pharmacological therapy for oesophageal\nvarices\nNon-selective beta-blockers is the best available modality for primary\nprophylaxis at present. (Grade A)\n3.1.2 Endoscopic Therapy for Oesophageal Varices\nEndoscopic treatment modalities available include variceal ligation and injection\nsclerotherapy. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is based on the concept that bleeding\nfrom varices is halted by thrombosis of the bleeding varix by intravariceal or\nparavariceal injection of a sclerosant. The most commonly used sclerosants\nare sodium tetradecyl sulphate (thrombovar) and ethanolamine oleate. There is little, if any, role for endoscopic sclerotherapy in the prevention of the\nindex variceal bleed. A meta-analysis of 20 randomised trials comparing\nprophylactic endoscopic sclerotherapy with no treatment showed significant\nheterogeneity between the trials to draw firm conclusions.37 The risk of sideeffects of sclerotherapy probably outweighs the potential benefits and two\nstudies suggest superiority of propranolol over sclerotherapy.38, 39\nEndoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is achieved by suction and ligating the varix\nin a banding device attached to the tip of the endoscope, similar to the technique\nused for ligation of internal haemorrhoids.

An initial meta-analysis of 4 randomised clinical trials40-43 comparing endoscopic\nligation and beta-blockers suggested that ligation is superior to beta-blockers\nin the prevention of variceal bleeding but the risk for mortality was similar in\nboth groups.44 A further meta-analysis of 5 trials failed to show significant\ndifferences between endoscopic ligation and beta-blockers either for bleeding\nor survival.36 In a more recent study, although a significantly higher failure rate\nof variceal bleeding and mortality was noted in patients on beta-blockers\ncompared to those receiving prophylactic EVL, the bleeding rate in the EVL\ngroup is unusually low with a relatively short period of follow-up.45 The\ncomparison between EVL and beta-blockers versus EVL monotherapy for\nprimary prophylaxis showed no difference between the two groups.46, 47\nNon-selective beta-blockers is the best available modality for primary\nprophylaxis at present (Level of evidence I). Prophylactic ligation may be\nindicated for patients who are intolerant or have contraindications to betablockers. 3.2\nGastric Varices\nThe risk of first bleeding from gastric varices is no greater than that from\noesophageal varices. Data on prevention of the first bleeding in patients with\ngastric varices is sparse. It is conceivable that beta-blocker therapy is equally\neffective in this situation. The efficacy of cyanoacrylate in these patients remains\ncontroversial.48\n4. SCREENING ENDOSCOPY\nCurrent guidelines for the primary prophylaxis of oesophageal varices\nrecommend universal screening endoscopy in patients with cirrhosis to identify\nthose who could benefit from therapy. The American College of Gastroenterology\nand the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease advocate screening\nendoscopy every other year in patients with cirrhosis not known to have varices. Patients with small varices on initial endoscopy should be screened for\nenlargement of varices every 1-2 years.26 A recent analysis by Spiegel et al.49\nsuggests that empiric beta-blocker therapy may be a more cost-effective\napproach in patients with compensated cirrhosis, whereas Arguedas et al.50\nfound that this strategy was cost-effective only in patients with decompensated\ncirrhosis. Until there are more studies comparing screening-directed versus\nempiric beta-blocker prophylaxis, the recent data should not immediately affect\nour current practice.

MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE VARICEAL BLEEDING\nThe report of the Baveno IV Consensus Workshop on portal hypertension states\nthe time frame for the acute variceal bleeding episode as 5 days and failure to\ncontrol bleeding as the need to change specific therapy.51\n5.1\nGeneral Management\nAcute variceal bleeding is a medical emergency that should be managed under\nintensive care facilities by a team of experienced medical staff including\nendoscopists, hepatologists, surgeons and nurses. Therapy is aimed at correcting\nhypovolumic shock and at achieving haemostasis at the bleeding site. This would\nbe instituted by aggressive resuscitation to restore haemodynamic stability. Two\nlarge bore intravenous lines should be in place. Blood volume restitution,\npreferably packed red blood cells, should be transfused cautiously and\nconservatively to keep the haemoglobin ideally around 8g/dL or haemocrit of\n24%.52 Overtransfusion should be avoided as this can increase portal pressures\nand exacerbate further bleeding. If the patient is haemodynamically unstable,\nelective intubation for airway protection should be considered. Pharmacotherapy\nto reduce portal pressure should be instituted and emergency endoscopy\nperformed to establish the diagnosis and location of the bleeding site. 5.2\nAntibiotics in Acute Variceal Bleeding\nBacterial infections are seen in about 20% of cirrhotics presenting with upper\ngastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours.53,54 The incidence of sepsis increases to\nalmost 66% at two weeks.50-57 Development of bacterial infection is associated\nwith high mortality and variceal re-bleeding.54,55 Antibiotic prophylaxis has been\nshown to reduce the rate of infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and rebleeding.56-60 In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis was clearly proven in a meta-analysis\nto significantly increase the survival rate.61 Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis for 7\ndays should be considered the standard of care in cirrhotic patients with upper\ngastrointestinal bleeding, irrespective of the type of haemorrhage (variceal or nonvariceal) or the presence or absence of ascites (Level of evidence I). As to the\nchoice of antibiotic, either third generation cephalosporins given intravenously or\noral quinolones (norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin) are generally recommended. Recommendations for antibiotics in acute variceal bleeding\nShort-term antibiotic prophylaxis for 7 days should be considered the\nstandard of care in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding,\nirrespective of the type of haemorrhage (variceal or non-variceal) or the\npresence or absence of ascites. (Grade A)\n5.3\nPharmacological Therapy for Acute Variceal Bleeding\nPharmacologic treatment is aimed at arresting haemorrhage by decreasing\npressure and blood flow within the oesophageal varices, thus, allowing\nhaemostasis at the bleeding points.

Vasoactive drugs have been shown to\ncontrol acute variceal bleeding in about 80% of patients.62-68 Vasoactive therapy\ncan be used empirically when variceal bleeding seems likely on clinical grounds. The current recommendation (Level of evidence I) is to start a vasoactive\ndrug as early as possible from the time of admission or even upon the patient\u2019s\ntransfer to the hospital.62,63 The agents available are vasopressin (either alone\nor in combination with nitroglycerine) or its analogues and somatostatin or its\nanalogues. The selection of the vasoactive drug is highly dependent on\navailability and the treating clinician\u2019s familiarity with each. Vasopressin was the first vasoactive agent used in the treatment of acute\nvariceal bleeding. It does, however, have significant systemic side-effects which\ninclude myocardial and mesenteric ischaemia and infarction.69 The addition of\nnitroglycerine to vasopressin enhances its efficacy and reduces the\ncardiovascular side-effects.70, 71\nTerlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue with fewer side-effects and a longer\nhalf-life than vasopressin, is effective in controlling acute variceal bleeding.72,73\nTerlipressin is administered as IV injections of 2mg bolus and 1mg every four to\nsix hours for 2-5 days. A meta-analysis demonstrated that terlipressin was\nassociated with a 34% relative risk reduction in mortality compared to placebo.72\nSomatostatin and its synthetic analogues, octreotide and vapreotide, control acute\nvariceal bleeding in up to 80% of patients and are generally considered to be\nequivalent to terlipressin but superior to vasopressin for the control of acute\nvariceal haemorrhage.73 Somatostatin is given as an IV 250mcg bolus followed\nby 250mcg/hour infusion. Octreotide is administered as a bolus injection of 50mcg\nfollowed by an infusion at a rate of 50mcg/hour. Somatostatin or octreotide therapy\nshould be maintained for 5 days to prevent early re-bleeding. In acute variceal bleeding, terlipressin may have an added advantage as it can\npotentially reverse hepatorenal syndrome.74 In addition, terlipressin has been\nshown to have a more sustained haemodynamic effect compared to treatment\nwith octreotide.75\nRecommendations for pharmacological therapy for acute variceal\nhaemorrhage\nA vasoactive drug should be started as early as possible from the time of\nadmission or even upon the patient\u2019s transfer to the hospital. (Grade A)\n6. MANAGEMENT OF OESOPHAGEAL VARICEAL BLEEDING\n6.1\nEndoscopic Therapy\nEndoscopic sclerotherapy stops bleeding in 80-90% of patients with acute\nvariceal haemorrhage.76-78 There was no difference between vasoactive drugs\nand endoscopic sclerotherapy in failure to control bleeding, early re-bleeding\nand mortality.79-81 However, adverse events such as oesophageal ulceration\nand stricture were significantly more severe with sclerotherapy. Control of\nbleeding may also be achieved by injection of tissue adhesives e.g. histoacryl/\ncyanoacrylate glue. Re-bleeding rates are similar to sclerosants but there is\nalso a higher risk of complications and damage to the endoscopic instrument. This should only be performed by experienced endoscopists when haemostasis\nhas not been achieved.", "chunk_order": 9}

This should only be performed by experienced endoscopists when haemostasis\nhas not been achieved. Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is more effective than sclerotherapy in\ncontrolling acute oesophageal variceal bleeding but without a survival\nadvantage.82-85 EVL is favoured in most settings because it leads to fewer\ncomplications and a survival advantage was demonstrated in one study.85\nTechnically, banding may be difficult at times because of limited visualisation\nfrom bleeding and sclerotherapy is used as it is easier to perform in this setting. The use of endoscopic therapy alone in the treatment of acute oesophageal\nvariceal bleeding has been challenged as pharmacological therapy is as\neffective as sclerotherapy, but with significantly less side-effects.86 However, a\nmeta-analysis on the efficacy of therapeutic regimens in acute variceal bleeding\nshowed that ligation was significantly more successful than pharmacological\ntherapy in the control of ongoing variceal bleeding.82 Therefore, EVL is\nrecommended for patients with acute variceal bleeding (Level of evidence I). An important newer approach has been the combination of a vasoactive agent\nand endoscopic therapy. The addition of vasoactive drugs for a period of five\ndays has been shown to facilitate endoscopy, improve control of bleeding, reduce\n5-day re-bleeding rate and transfusion requirements,87-90 but with no effect on\nmortality.91 Combination therapy was beneficial both in low-risk and high-risk\npatients,92 even if administered just after the endoscopic procedure.11,93,94\nRecommendations for endoscopic therapy for acute oesophageal\nvariceal haemorrhage\nEndoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is recommended for patients with acute\nvariceal bleeding. (Grade A)\n6.2\nBalloon Tamponade\nAlthough generally considered effective for stopping bleeding,95 balloon\ntamponade is known to have a high re-bleeding rate when the balloon is\ndecompressed and is associated with serious complications such as ulceration,\nperforation and aspiration pneumonia. In addition, sclerotherapy achieved a\nhigher rate of initial haemostasis compared to balloon tamponade.96,97 Thus,\nthis should only be considered if facilities for endoscopy are not available prior\nto transfer to a tertiary centre or as a temporary \u2018bridge\u2019 for a maximum of 24\nhours until definitive treatment can be instituted. This should be used in\nconjunction with pharmacological therapy. The balloon should be kept in the\nrefrigerator, taken out only at the time of the procedure and inserted by a\npersonnel who is familiar with the procedure. 6.3\nTransjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts (TIPS)\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) is effective in the\ntreatment of acute variceal bleeding with a success rate of over 90% in arresting\nhaemorrhage.98,99 The main limiting factors to the use of TIPS are the high\nmorbidity and mortality:100,101 the 30-day mortality approaches 100% in patients\nwith advanced liver disease, ongoing sepsis and multi-organ failure.102\nTherefore, the most widely accepted indication for TIPS is as a rescue therapy\nfor uncontrolled variceal bleeding after combined pharmacological and\nendoscopic therapy (Level of evidence II).", "chunk_order": 10}

Recommendations for surgical therapy\nThe role of surgical therapy in the management of acute variceal bleed\nhas been relegated to salvage haemostatic therapy. (Grade B)\n6.5\nSecondary Prophylaxis\nSecondary prophylaxis is the prevention of recurrent bleeding after a first\nepisode variceal bleed. Secondary prophylaxis should be started from the sixth\nday of the index variceal bleed.51\n6.5.1 Pharmacological Therapy\nSecondary prophylactic therapy with pharmacological therapy is based on the\nassumption that a sustained reduction in portal pressure reduces the incidence\nof variceal re-bleeding. Beta-blockers are still the mainstay of\npharmacotherapy.104-106 A meta-analysis of 12 randomised controlled trials\ncomparing non-selective beta-blockers to either no treatment or placebo showed\na statistically significant reduction in the risk of recurrent bleeding and survival\nadvantage.107 The incidence of recurrent variceal bleeding was 42.7% in the\nplacebo group and 32% in the beta-blocker group, a reduction in the risk of\nbleeding by one third, and mortality from 27% to 20%.11,108 The number of\npatients needed to treat in order to prevent one re-bleeding episode is 5, and\nthe number needed to treat in order to prevent a death is 14. Intolerance to\npropranolol leads to discontinuation of treatment in 30% of patients. Although\nthe addition of isosorbide mononitrate to beta-blockers for secondary\nprophylaxis appears to be superior to beta-blocker monotherapy in the\nprevention of variceal re-bleeding, survival benefit was not demonstrated.108\nTherefore, non-selective beta-blockers should be used for secondary\nprophylaxis (Level of evidence I).

(Grade A)\n6.5.2 Endoscopic Therapy\nFor the prevention of variceal re-bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy is\nperformed every 10-14 days until the varices are obliterated, which typically\nrequires 5 or 6 sessions. Sclerotherapy proved more effective than placebo in\nterms of prevention of variceal re-bleeding and mortality.109 However, endoscopic\nvariceal band ligation has superseded sclerotherapy in the prevention of\nrecurrent oesophageal variceal haemorrhage (Level of evidence I) because\nthe risk of re-bleeding is lower than sclerotherapy (approximately 25% vs. 30%\nrespectively at one year), causes fewer complications, requires fewer sessions\nto eradicate the varices and has a survival benefit.83,110-113 Similar to\nsclerotherapy, EVL is performed every 10 to 14 days until the varices are\neradicated, which usually takes 3 or 4 sessions. The addition of sclerotherapy\nto ligation has not been shown to be advantageous:114,115 a higher incidence of\noesophageal stricture was noted in the group who had both sclerotherapy and\nligation.116 A more recent meta-analysis confirmed earlier reports that the\ncombination of EVL and sclerotherapy is not superior to EVL alone in the risk\nof oesophageal variceal re-bleeding, death or time to variceal obliteration.117\nComparison of beta-blockers and isosorbide mononitrate with endoscopic\nvariceal band ligation revealed either no significant difference in the variceal\nre-bleeding episodes or in survival,118,119 or significantly less variceal re-bleeding\nbut a higher death rate in the EVL group.120 In one study, a higher variceal rebleeding rate was noted in the EVL group as compared with pharmacological\ntherapy (49% vs. 33% respectively).121 However, pharmacological therapy was\nfound to be effective largely in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. Noteworthy,\nthe risk of recurrent bleeding and of death was significantly lower in patients\nwho had a haemodynamic response to therapy (defined as a reduction in the\nHVPG by more than 20% of the baseline value or to less than 12mmHg).

Combination therapy involving endoscopic variceal ligation and beta-adrenergic\nblockers is probably the preferred treatment but warrants additional trials.51\n6.5.4 Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts (TIPS)\nTIPS is more effective than endoscopic therapy for the prevention of variceal rebleeding with 8-18% recurrent variceal bleeding rate at one year:126-129 shunt\ndysfunction either due to occlusion or stenosis is almost always the cause. However,\nTIPS is associated with the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in at least 25%\nof patients after the procedure,130,131 lacks survival benefit over endoscopic\ntherapy,132-134 is more costly than pharmacological therapy135 and therefore, should\nnot be used as a first-choice treatment for secondary prophylaxis. 6.5.5 Surgical Therapy\nPrevention of recurrent variceal bleeding with surgery may be more effective\nthan pharmacological or endoscopic therapy in patients with preserved synthetic\nfunction provided that it is performed by an experienced surgeon.136-139 Portal\nblood flow-preserving procedures such as selective shunts or devascularisation\nprocedures appears to be better than decompressive surgical shunts with rebleeding rate of 6% vs. 14.3% and postoperative encephalopathy of 6% vs. 21% respectively.140,141 In addition, selective shunts do not exclude the patients\nfor future liver transplantation. In comparison with TIPS, surgical shunts are significantly more invasive but\nplacement of TIPS resulted in higher re-bleeding rate142 and cost143 than surgical\nshunt due to subsequent occlusion and re-bleeding with no significant effect\non mortality. TIPS is most suited for patients with Child\u2019s B or C cirrhosis,\nparticularly those who are candidates for liver transplantation while surgical\nshunts should be limited to patients with Child\u2019s A cirrhosis.144\nSecondary prophylaxis with TIPS or surgical shunt is preferred for patients\nwho are non-compliant with pharmacological or endoscopic therapy (Level of\nevidence II).

CONCLUSION\nThe current first choice treatment in patients with oesophageal varices who have\nnot bled is prophylactic non-selective beta-blocker therapy.
