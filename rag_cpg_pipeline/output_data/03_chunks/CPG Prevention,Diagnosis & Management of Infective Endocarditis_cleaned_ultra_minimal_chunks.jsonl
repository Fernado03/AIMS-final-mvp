This is due to the changing epidemiology of the disease, the\nwide spectrum of presentation extending from the neonate to\nthe elderly, diagnostic difficulties, delayed surgical interventions\nand embolic complications. The advances in cardiothoracic\nsurgery and cardiology over the years with the increasing use\nof prosthetic material, valves and intracardiac devices have also contributed to the\nchallenges in managing IE in these patients. Some important evolution in management strategies would be the development\nof an Endocarditis Team with multidisciplinary expertise in cardiology,\ncardiothoracic surgery, infectious disease and other subspecialties as indicated. This is encouraged to enable early diagnosis, optimise treatment and prevent\ncomplications in these patients. It also allows for smoother and more efficient\nreferrals to specialised centres. Previously, surgical intervention was delayed because of the high-risk and mortality\nbut, recently published data have also shown that early surgical interventions in\nthese patients decrease embolic complications and improve outcomes. There have also been changes with regards to antimicrobial prophylaxis. The\nevidence currently shows that routine antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to dental\nprocedures is not indicated for all cardiac patients and should be limited to highrisk cardiac patients only. Maintaining a good oral and skin hygiene routine is highly\nrecommended in the prevention of IE. With these recent developments in the prevention, diagnosis and management\nof IE, it is timely that we develop local clinical practice guidelines to update all\nrespective healthcare providers with regards to the new management strategies. I congratulate the committee for the effort and hope that these guidelines would\nserve to decrease the incidence of IE and its associated morbidity and mortality.

Diagnosis\n\u2022 Early and accurate diagnosis of IE is crucial to institute appropriate treatment\nand prevent complications. A high level of clinical suspicion of IE is warranted\nespecially in those with pre-existing risk factors (refer Section 3.1.1). \u2022 Due to the varied spectrum of the disease, a combination of clinical\nassessment, microbiological testing and imaging are required to make the\ndiagnosis. \u2022 Blood culture is a key investigation in the diagnosis of IE. Proper technique of\nblood culture collection is crucial, as this will reduce the rate of contamination\nand yield a true positive result (refer Appendix 3). \u2022 Blood cultures should be drawn for patients with fever of unexplained origin\nand a heart murmur, a history of heart disease or previous endocarditis. \u2022 Three sets of blood cultures should be obtained first before administering\nantimicrobials when a patient has fever and predisposing risk factors for IE. \u2022 If blood cultures remain negative after 5 days of incubation and there\nis no history of prior antimicrobial use, consider blood culture negative\ninfective endocarditis (BCNIE), which can be caused by fungi or fastidious\nmicroorganisms, and perform the appropriate microbiological tests (refer Table\n3.2 and Figure 3a). \u2022 Histopathological examination (HPE) of cardiac tissue/vegetations obtained\nduring surgery is of diagnostic value and is recommended. \u2022 A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be obtained without delay if the\ndiagnosis of IE is suspected. \u2022 Echocardiogram findings should be interpreted in the context of the clinical\nscenario and repeated if the clinical suspicion of IE persists despite a negative\ninitial echocardiogram. \u2022 Transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE/TEE) should be done if initial TTE\nexamination is negative, in patients with strong clinical suspicion of IE, in those\nwith prosthetic valves/cardiac material and in those with high-risk features (refer\nFigure 3b). \u2022 Echocardiography plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of IE, monitoring for\ncomplications and progression of valvular dysfunction, assessing the outcome\nof surgical repair and in the follow-up after completion of antimicrobials (refer\nto Table: Role of echocardiography in the diagnosis and management of IE,\nbelow). \u2022 In patients with S. aureus bacteraemia from an unknown aetiology or persistent\nbacteraemia despite antimicrobials, echocardiography should be considered. \u2022 Some newer imaging modalities (multislice computed tomography; MSCT,\nmagnetic resonance imaging; MRI and nuclear imaging) can assist in\ndiagnosing IE and its complications.", "chunk_order": 8}

Management\n\u2022 The management of IE is aimed at eradicating the infection, and preventing and\ntreating both intra and extracardiac complications. \u2022 Patients with complicated IE should preferably be referred to a specialist\ncentre. Specialist centres are those with cardiothoracic, cardiac imaging and\nspecialised cardiology services (refer Section 4.1.4). \u2022 A multidisciplinary team approach involving infectious disease (ID) physicians,\ncardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons and other relevant subspecialty experts\nis essential in the management of IE (refer Table 4.2). \u2022 In all patients with suspected endocarditis, elicit risk factors for fastidious/\nintracellular pathogens (refer Table 3.2). \u2022 The mainstay of treatment is appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy\n(refer Section 4.2).

This is primarily due to a more ageing society in\ndeveloped countries that relies on increasing invasive medical care, the presence\nof degenerative valve disease and co-morbidities.4-6 In developing countries,\nrheumatic heart disease is still the most common predisposing cause of IE.6-9 About\n50% of IE in developing countries occur in patients with no known history of valve\ndisease.4,8 Healthcare associated IE (refer to Appendix 1) is increasing with some\nstudies reporting incidence of up to 25%.5,10 The gender distribution of IE is male to\nfemale case ratio of more than 2:1.4,5\nIE commonly affects native valves, usually involving the left-sided heart valves (2/3rd\nof the cases) with the mitral valve commonly affected.5 Streptococcus species\n(spp.) is the most common microorganism causing IE in developing countries, in\nthe younger age group and in those with pre-existing structural heart disease6-8\ncompared to developed countries where Staphylococcal spp. tend to be more\ncommon.4,5,11\nComplication rates of IE have been reported to be high (16-33%) leading to high\nmortality rates of up to 39% in certain studies.5 In a prospective multicentre study,\nthe following risk factors were shown to increase mortality in IE patients:5\n\u2022 Paravalvular complications (odds ratio; OR: 2.25). \u2022 Pulmonary oedema (OR: 1.79). \u2022 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection (OR: 1.54). \u2022 Prosthetic valve involvement (OR: 1.47). \u2022 Increasing age (OR: 1.30). \u2022 Mitral valve vegetation (OR: 1.34). 2.0\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nAlthough surgery can be associated with high risks,12 it has been shown to reduce\nmortality in complicated cases (hazard ratio; HR 0.33).6 Based on the available\nevidence, surgical intervention was required in about 50% of IE patients.5,13\nPrendergast et al. stated surgery was required in 25-50% of cases during acute\ninfection and in 20-40% during convalescence.12\nA recent local study done in Hospital Kuala Lumpur14 (a tertiary inner city hospital)\nreported 36 cases of definite IE diagnosed over a period of 2 years (20132014). Eighty percent were male (male to female ratio 4:1) and the median age\nat presentation was 36 years (interquartile range; IQR 23). The predominant race\naffected was the Malays (60%). In this urban inner city cohort,14 IE mainly affected\nnormal valves (39%), and intravenous drug use (IVDU) was the commonest\npredominant risk factor (36%). Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was the predominant\nmicroorganism grown from blood cultures (30%). All patients were treated with\nantimicrobials; with 91% on antimicrobial therapy for a duration of 42 days or less.", "chunk_order": 16}

The clinical\ncourse of the disease can vary from subacute to acute infection, and each will\nmanifest differently. Patients often visit multiple health practitioners before a correct\ndiagnosis is made. Making a clinical diagnosis of IE requires:\n\u2022 Careful and thorough clinical history taking and physical examination. \u2022 Laboratory investigations. \u2022 Microbiological investigations. \u2022 Histopathological examinations; HPE (when possible). \u2022 Imaging, namely echocardiography and radiological investigations. In difficult cases, consultation with other experts such as ID specialists, cardiac\nimaging specialists and microbiologists may be required. 3.1 Clinical evaluation of suspected infective endocarditis\nThe most common symptom at presentation (up to 87%) is fever associated with\nchills, poor appetite and weight loss. Heart failure may be present at admission (up\nto 58%) and there may be a new or altered cardiac murmur (50-85%).15,16 Embolic\nevents may also cause presenting symptoms (27-30%) and these events may be\nsingular or multiple in nature.13,16,17\n3.1.1 Pre-existing risk factors\nA high level of suspicion of IE is warranted in patients with fever and pre-existing risk\nfactors who present with non-specific symptoms.

Magnetic resonance imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity than computed\ntomography (CT) in detecting cerebral embolic events, majority of which are\nclinically silent.48 Studies have shown that systematic cerebral MRI during\nacute IE has consistently reported frequent cerebral embolic lesions, in 6080% of patients.48-50\nMost commonly seen abnormalities are:50\n\u2022 Ischaemic lesions (50-80%). >\n>\nSmall ischaemic lesions are more frequent than larger territorial\ninfarcts. \u2022 Parenchymal or subarachnoidal haemorrhage (\u2264 10%). \u2022 Abscesses or mycotic aneurysms (< 10%).

However, it may play a role in further management\n(e.g. to detect intra-abdominal occult abscesses although CT abdomen\nwould be the preferred investigation for this). 3.0 DIAGNOSIS\nC. Nuclear imaging\nNew modalities in nuclear imaging like single-photon emission computed\ntomography (SPECT)/CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/\nCT are evolving as important supplementary assessments for patients\nwith suspected IE and diagnostic difficulties. Several reports have shown\npromising results for radiolabelled white blood cell (WBC) SPECT/CT and\nfluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG); 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in\nIE. Nuclear imaging may be of added value in refining a \u2018possible IE\u2019 to a\n\u2018definite IE\u2019 based on the Duke criteria by detecting peripheral embolic and\nmetastatic infectious lesions.54,55 There is also growing evidence that cardiac\nnuclear imaging can play a key role in the diagnosis and management of\npatients with suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis. Recent European\nSociety of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of IE updated\nin 2015 have added 18F-FDG PET/CT or radiolabelled WBC SPECT/CT\nas a new major criterion if abnormal uptakes are found around the area of\nprosthetic valve implantation in patients with a prosthesis implanted for more\nthan 3 months.16 However, the limited availability of these modalities in the\nlocal setting also limits its usage in the diagnosis and management of IE (refer\nAppendix 6). KEY MESSAGE:\n1. MSCT can be used to assess for perivalvular extensions and\nextracardiac complications and/or embolism. 2. MRI is more sensitive than CT in diagnosing cerebral embolic\nlesions many of which are silent. 3. Radiolabelled WBC SPECT/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT may have a\nsupplementary role in detecting peripheral embolic or metastatic\ninfectious lesions in those with high clinical suspicion of IE and\ndiagnostic difficulties.

In the year 2000, taking into account further\nevidence, the Duke criteria was refined further into the modified Duke criteria56 (refer\nTable 3.7) which is currently widely used in clinical practice. The Duke criteria should be used as a research tool rather than a clinical tool for\ndiagnosing IE, therefore clinicians should treat each individual patient appropriately. In very ill patients and patients in whom the diagnosis of IE is likely, empirical treatment\nshould be started before blood culture results are available. This classification has a\nsensitivity of approximately 80% overall, when the criteria are evaluated at the end\nof patient follow-up in epidemiological studies.57\nTable 3.7: Definition of IE according to the modified Duke criteria\nDefinite IE\nPathological criteria:\nMicroorganisms demonstrated by culture or HPE of a vegetation, a vegetation\nthat has embolised, or an intracardiac abscess specimen;\nor pathological lesions; vegetation or intracardiac abscess confirmed by HPE\nshowing active endocarditis\nClinical criteria:\n2 major criteria\nor\n1 major criterion and 3 minor criteria\nor\n5 minor criteria\nPossible IE\n1 major criterion and 1 minor criterion\nor\n3 minor criteria\nRejected IE\nFirm alternative diagnosis explaining evidence of IE\nor resolution of IE syndrome with antimicrobial therapy for \u2264 4 days\nor no pathological evidence of IE at surgery or autopsy with antimicrobial\ntherapy for \u2264 4 days\nor does not meet criteria for possible IE as above\n3.0 DIAGNOSIS\n3.0 DIAGNOSIS\nMajor Criteria\nBlood culture\npositive for IE\nTypical microorganisms consistent with IE from 2\nseparate blood cultures:\n\u2022 VGS, Streptococcus bovis, HACEK group, S.", "chunk_order": 29}

Factors which\nmaximise treatment success include:\n\u2022 Early diagnosis. \u2022 Accurate microorganism identification. \u2022 Reliable susceptibility testing. \u2022 Prolonged intravenous administration of bactericidal antimicrobial therapy. \u2022 Proper monitoring of potentially toxic regimens. \u2022 Aggressive surgical management of correctable mechanical complications. 4.1.1 Monitoring\nWhilst in the ward, general management steps include the monitoring of:\n\u2022 Clinical condition:\n>\n>\nFever:\n\u00bb\u00bb\nFever usually resolves in a few days after commencement of appropriate\nantimicrobials. \u00bb\u00bb\nHowever, fever may return after this initial period in 30% of cases. \u00bb\u00bb\nIf fever persists after 10 days of treatment, the patient should be\nevaluated for suppurative complications (e.g. abscess collections in the\nabdomen, lungs or intracardiac abscess). >\n>\nThe patient should be examined regularly for symptoms and signs of the\nfollowing:\n\u00bb\u00bb\nHeart failure: symptoms should be treated with standard medical\ntherapy and its severity regularly assessed.

All IE patients who develop cardiac complications should be referred to a SC (a\ncentre with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery services; refer Section 4.1.4)\nas most would need more advanced imaging, surgical intervention and cardiac\nintensive services. 4.1.2.1 Heart failure\nHeart failure is the most common complication of IE, which occurs in up\nto half of all cases.62 It is the most important predictor of mortality. In most\ncases of IE, heart failure is usually caused by valvular dysfunction and not\nmyocardial failure.63 Heart failure is more commonly associated with aortic\nvalve dysfunction compared to mitral valve dysfunction.64 Less commonly,\nintracardiac fistulae may also cause heart failure.65 The clinical presentation of\nheart failure includes dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock. The management of heart failure in infective endocarditis\nA. Imaging and monitoring in heart failure\nEchocardiography (TTE or TEE) is important in the evaluation of:\n\u2022 Acute valve regurgitation: if symptoms or signs of heart failure occur, an\nechocardiogram should be performed immediately to diagnose possible\nacute valve regurgitation, which carries a very high mortality. In acute\nregurgitation, the size of the chamber may be normal or only slightly\nenlarged. Ejection fraction may be normal. There may be findings of:\n>\n>\nExtensive destruction of the valve leaflets. >\n>\nMassive regurgitation. >\n>\nAbscess or pseudoaneurysms. 4.0 MANAGEMENT\n4.0 MANAGEMENT\nHowever in cases of chronic valve regurgitation with superimposed IE, the\nsize of the cardiac chamber may be enlarged with impaired systolic function. \u2022 Valve perforation. \u2022 Secondary mitral lesions. \u2022 Aneurysms/fistula (are best assessed using TEE).43\n\u2022 Haemodynamic consequences of valvular dysfunction:\n>\n>\nMeasurement of pulmonary artery pressure. >\n>\nDetection of pericardial effusion. >\n>\nAssessment and monitoring of left ventricular systolic function.43\nB.

In cases of both suspected persistent infection and perivalvular extension,\nthe following should be considered:\n\u2022 Regular (e.g. daily) ECG to monitor for conduction abnormalities e.g. AV\nblock. \u2022 Perform a TEE in cases of persistent fever especially in those with\nprosthetic valves, aortic valve IE and S. aureus infection, or new AV\nblock. \u2022 Perform an ECG-gated cardiac CT scan to assess for aortic root\nabscess or perivalvular extension in cases when TEE facilities are not\navailable. 4.0 MANAGEMENT\n4.1.2.3 Systemic embolism\nThe risk of systemic embolism is very high in IE (20-50%) and life-threatening\ncomplications are often related to the migration of cardiac vegetations. The\nrisk is highest during the first days following the initiation of antimicrobial\ntherapy and rapidly decreases subsequent to that.61,67 Frequent sites for\nembolisation in left-sided IE are the brain and spleen whilst pulmonary\nembolism frequently occurs in native right-sided and pacemaker lead IE.68\nStroke is a major complication and is associated with increased morbidity\nand mortality.68\nFactors associated with an increased risk of embolism are:\n\u2022 Vegetation size > 10 mm (higher risk if > 15 mm).69\n\u2022 Mobility of vegetations.69\n\u2022 Location of the vegetation on the anterior mitral valve leaflet. \u2022 Increase in the size of the vegetation under antimicrobial therapy.60\n\u2022 S. aureus60 and Streptococcus bovis70 infection. \u2022 Fungal endocarditis. \u2022 Previous embolism.61\n\u2022 Multivalvular IE.71\n\u2022 Biological markers (e.g. elevated CRP).72\nEmbolisation may occur before diagnosis, usually within the first 2-4 weeks\nof therapy or after antimicrobial therapy.68 Late embolisation can occur up to\n15-30 weeks after diagnosis usually due to poor response to antimicrobial\ntreatment. In order to predict the risk of embolic events, several features can\nbe assessed with the use of echocardiography.", "chunk_order": 34}

They are usually related to\nthe size, mobility and the location of the vegetation.60,68\nDistal emboli may lead to metastatic infection or abscesses.63 Emboli may\nalso involve other systemic organs such as the liver, kidneys and abdominal\nmesenteric vessels.63 Osteomyelitis is estimated to occur in 2-6% of cases of\nIE and is more common in intravenous (IV) drug abusers.73 18F-FDG PET/CT\nimaging in IE has been useful in detecting peripheral embolic and metastatic\ninfectious events in some cases where other diagnostic imaging has not\nidentified foci.54\n4.0 MANAGEMENT\n4.1.2.4 Neurological complications\nIE can have profound and devastating neurological consequences. Neurological\ncomplications can occur before or during the diagnosis of IE, but they can\nalso occur later in the clinical course of IE. Symptomatic neurological events\ndevelop in 25-40% of patients with IE.4,46,74\nMost neurological complications occur early in the course of IE and they\nare most common in left-sided IE. The most common complications are\nischaemic and haemorrhagic complications. Diagnosis of neurological complications\nIt is important to make the diagnosis of neurological complications early, as\nwell as to assess the severity of the complication. Intracerebral events are\ndiagnosed by history-taking, clinical examination, and by imaging modalities. Imaging modalities commonly used for the assessment of intracerebral\nevents include:\n\u2022 CT scan, with or without contrast agents (most commonly performed). \u2022 MRI, with or without gadolinium enhancement (better detection in\npatients with focal neurological lesions and may also detect lesions in\npatients without symptoms e.g. microbleeds). In addition to normal\nsequences, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI)/T2weighted (T2W) gradient-echo (GRE) sequences are important to show\nasymptomatic infarcts or small microbleeds respectively. \u2022 Cerebral angiography is advisable when there is strong clinical suspicion\nof mycotic aneurysm despite negative findings on non-invasive imaging\nmodalities. Imaging investigations should be done as soon as clinical features appear,\npreferably within 24 hours. The presence of neurological complications, its\ntype and severity is important as it will impact the optimal management of IE. It is of particular importance to be specific when describing and grading\nthe neurological complications of IE (refer Table 4.1). 4.0 MANAGEMENT\nTable 4.1: Description of neurological complications\nNeurologic\ncomplication\nEpidemiology\nClinical\nmanifestation\nin IE\nManagement\nImplications for\ncardiac surgery if\nindicated\nIschaemic\nClinically present\nin 20-40% of\npatients with IE.

Adapted from Morris et al. Neurohospitalist. 2014.81\n\u2022 Patients at highest risk of morbidity and mortality are those who had\nmoderate-severe ischaemic strokes and intracranial haemorrhage. \u2022 Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible as the rate\nof neurological complications reduces significantly after one week of\ntreatment. \u2022 Anticoagulation therapy (warfarin or heparin) should be reviewed and\nadjusted according to clinical status (e.g. S. aureus IE in the presence of\na mechanical prosthetic valve). \u2022 However, despite antimicrobial therapy, patients with large vegetations\n(> 10 mm) should be considered for early surgical intervention (refer\nChapter 5.0). Management of neurological complications\nA. General Principles\nSome general measures in the management of neurological complications:\n\u2022 Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as diagnosis is made to\nreduce the development of complications in the first week. \u2022 The duration of antimicrobial therapy will depend on the type of\ncomplication and microorganism involved (refer Section 4.2). \u2022 In the event of any neurological complication, it is advisable to refer to a\nneurologist for consultation and further management. \u2022 Referrals to a neurosurgeon and interventional radiologist may be\nneeded in the event of an intracerebral bleed, mycotic aneurysm or\nbrain abscess. 4.0 MANAGEMENT\nB. Management of ischaemic and haemorrhagic complications\nIschaemic stroke and haemorrhagic events are associated with higher\nmortality. Therefore, it is crucial to anticipate the potential risk in patients\nwith predisposing factors for embolisation (refer Section 4.1.2.3), make a\nrapid diagnosis and initiate appropriate antimicrobials as soon as possible to\nprevent a first or recurrent neurological event.80\nC. Management of mycotic aneurysms\nAn aneurysm is a focal arterial dilatation involving all three layers of the\narterial wall. Anuerysmal degeneration secondary to bacteraemia or septic\nembolisation is called a mycotic aneurysm. They are thin walled, friable\nand rupture easily resulting in intracranial haemorrhage. Cerebral mycotic\naneurysms are a rare and deadly type of aneurysm that have no definitive\ntreatment guidelines and represent 0.7-5.4% of all cerebral aneurysms. The\nmortality rate after rupture could reach as high as 80%.82 The diagnosis of\nmycotic aneurysm is made by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or\ncerebral angiography.", "chunk_order": 37}

The\nmortality rate after rupture could reach as high as 80%.82 The diagnosis of\nmycotic aneurysm is made by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or\ncerebral angiography. The evolution of mycotic aneurysms is unpredictable even after antimicrobial\ntherapy and variable outcomes have been reported.83 Predictive factors for\naneurysmal rupture have not been ascertained up to date. The treatment of mycotic aneurysms should be tailored according to\nresponse to antimicrobial therapy, location of aneurysm and clinical\nstatus of the patient. They can be treated surgically, endovascularly or\nby watchful waiting. Cerebral mycotic aneurysms should be treated\nby a multidisciplinary team in a tertiary centre. This team consists of\ncardiologists, neurosurgeons, interventional neuroradiologists, neurologists\nand intensivists. In addition, this centre must have facilities and expertise to\nmanage cerebral mycotic aneurysm patients. There are many factors which\ndetermine the choice of management, either open surgery or endovascular\nmanagement. However, the most important are the following:82\n\u2022 The morphology and location of the aneurysm. \u2022 Whether it is possible to sacrifice the parent artery. \u2022 Whether the patient needs or has received valve replacement surgery. \u2022 The patient\u2019s overall status. Decisions by the multidisciplinary team should be followed after discussion\nwith the patient and family members. In the management of complications in IE:\n1. Surgery should be considered in patients with acute heart failure due to\nmechanical complications (refer Chapter 5.0). [I/B]\n2. Further imaging should be considered in patients with persistent infection\nor high-risk for systemic embolisation. [IIa/C]\n3. A multidisciplinary team inclusive of a neurologist with or without a\nneurosurgeon is recommended in the management of patients with IE and\nneurological complications. [I/C]\n4.

[IIb/C]\nRecommendations\n4.0 MANAGEMENT\nIf cardiac surgery is needed in the presence of a mycotic aneurysm, preoperative endovascular intervention may be considered. Endovascular\nintervention involves occluding the aneurysm with a coil or other occluder\nmaterials (such as autologous clots or polyvinyl alcohol microparticles) and\ncan be done safely with good outcomes in centres with available expertise.83\nThe role for routine MRA or cerebral angiography in all patients with left-sided\nIE is unknown as is the role of prophylactic coiling of all asymptomatic\nmycotic aneurysms.

The management\nof ischaemic stroke due to IE is different to ischaemic strokes from non-infective\ncauses with regards to anticoagulation. Anticoagulation in the setting of IE raises concerns of intracerebral haemorrhage,\nan often fatal event. Cerebral haemorrhage in endocarditis occurs through one of\nthree mechanisms:\n\u2022 Acute pyogenic arteritis secondary to uncontrolled infection. \u2022 Haemorrhagic transformation of embolic infarcts. \u2022 Rupture of dilated mycotic aneurysms. Antiplatelet therapy\nThe potential role of antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin to reduce cerebrovascular\nevents in IE has been investigated. \u2022 Aspirin has not been shown to be of clear benefit as an adjunctive treatment in\nreducing mortality or morbidity in IE75,85 and initiation of aspirin as treatment for\nIE is not recommended. \u2022 In patients who were on aspirin long-term prior to the diagnosis of IE, it may be\ncontinued if there are no bleeding complications.86\n\u2022 The role of other antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel has not yet been\nextensively investigated. Anticoagulation with warfarin\nCerebral haemorrhage is a major determinant of poor clinical outcome in IE. A. Native valve infective endocarditis\n\u2022 No evidence of a cerebrovascular ischaemic or haemorrhagic event. >\n>\nWarfarin may be continued for those who are on anticoagulation with\nwarfarin for non-valvular indications (e.g. atrial fibrillation and deep vein\nthrombosis).87\n\u2022 Presence of a cerebrovascular ischaemic or haemorrhagic event. >\n>\nWarfarin should be stopped to prevent haemorrhagic transformation (in the\ncase of ischaemic stroke) or expansion of the haemorrhagic event.88\n>\n>\nWarfarin may be recommenced 2-3 weeks after the event or until the\nperiod of sepsis is over.89\n>\n>\nThe role of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and new oral\nanticoagulants (NOAC) in this context is not known. It is advisable to stop\nall forms of anticoagulation such as NOAC or LMWH in the event of an\nischaemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage in IE patients.81\nB. Mechanical prosthetic valve infective endocarditis\nPatients with mechanical prosthetic valves require anticoagulation with warfarin\nbecause of the risk of thromboembolic complications. Mechanical prosthetic\nvalve IE (MPVIE) carries a higher mortality and poorer prognosis compared\nto native valve IE (NVE).90,91 In MPVIE, the risks of cerebral haemorrhage with\ncontinued anticoagulation need to be weighed against the risk of thromboembolic\ncomplications from the mechanical prosthesis if anticoagulation is stopped. The thromboembolic risk is higher with certain features such as:92\n\u2022 Prosthetic mitral valves rather than aortic valves. \u2022 Non-bileaflet valves. \u2022 Early post-operative period (< 3 months) rather than late post-operative period. \u2022 Presence of atrial fibrillation. \u2022 Left ventricular dysfunction. \u2022 Left atrial dilatation. \u2022 Previous thromboembolic events. \u2022 Hypercoagulable conditions (e.g. pregnancy).", "chunk_order": 39}

In the event that a major ischaemic cerebral event occurs in MPVIE, it is reasonable\nto:\n\u2022 Stop warfarin for at least 2-3 weeks during the period of highest risk for\nhaemorrhagic transformation. \u2022 Unfractionated heparin may be used from the 2nd week after stopping warfarin\nunder close monitoring to reduce the thromboembolic complications from the\nmechanical valve prosthesis. \u2022 Patients with77,80 MPVIE due to S. aureus have been shown to be at much\nhigher risk for cerebral haemorrhage. In these cases, even if there is no\nneurological complication, once diagnosis of IE is made warfarin can be\nstopped and substituted with unfractionated heparin for 2 weeks. 4.0 MANAGEMENT\nIn the event of intracranial bleeding occurring in MPVIE:\n\u2022 Anticoagulation should be stopped. \u2022 Anticoagulation should be avoided during the first 2 weeks as the risk of\nfurther bleeding and expansion of the intracerebral haemorrhage is highest\nduring this period. \u2022 It is reasonable in most cases to restart anticoagulation with caution using\nunfractionated heparin after 2 weeks as the risk of further intracranial bleeding\nis low after 2 weeks, while the risk of thromboembolic complications in\nmechanical prosthetic valves without anticoagulation increases.89,93\n\u2022 In cases where the risk of further intracranial bleeding after 2 weeks is judged\nto be high by the neurosurgical team, this must be balanced with the risk of\nthromboembolic complications from the mechanical prosthetic valve without\nanticoagulation, and a consensus decision made by the team. \u2022 In those patients with MPVIE who may require imminent surgery it is advisable\nto discontinue warfarin at the time of diagnosis until the management plan is\nelucidated. \u2022 If surgery is not indicated and the patient is deemed stable without\ncontraindications or neurologic complications, warfarin can be restarted with\ncaution.94\nRestarting anticoagulation should be done very cautiously starting with intravenous\nunfractionated heparin guided by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)\nmonitoring and subsequently with dose adjusted warfarin. The role of LMWH in\nthis context is not known. There are currently no guidelines on the use of NOAC for\nmechanical prosthetic valves. A Phase II trial on dabigatran in mechanical valves\nwas terminated early due to excess bleeding in the dabigatran arm. 4.0 MANAGEMENT\nOn the use of anticoagulants in IE patients with neurological\ncomplications:\n1.

[IIa/C]\nRecommendations\n4.1.4 Referral for specialist care\nIE is an unusual disease for a few reasons:\n\u2022 The clinical manifestation, predisposing risk factors and epidemiology of IE can\nbe very variable. \u2022 Despite being relatively rare, it has significant morbidity and mortality. \u2022 Ideal management of IE requires multiple, highly specialised expertise in one\ncentre which is often not widely available. These include but are not limited to:\nechocardiologists, ID specialists, cardiac surgeons, interventional radiologists,\nneurologists, neurosurgeons and microbiologists. To ensure a good outcome and to prevent complications, it is important to establish\nan accurate diagnosis early and institute appropriate treatment. It is recommended\nto have a multidisciplinary team approach in the management of patients with IE\nespecially those with high-risk features. Where indicated, these patients may need\nadditional subspecialty consultation or referral to a specialist centre. A Specialist\nCentre (SC) is defined here as a hospital with cardiothoracic, cardiac imaging and\nspecialised cardiology services (refer Appendix 7). Referral to a SC is recommended in the following situations (refer Table 4.2):\n\u2022 Strong clinical suspicion of IE but TTE negative. >\n>\nRequires TEE and/or other imaging modalities to diagnose IE and to\nmonitor for complications. \u2022 Patients with high predisposing risks. >\n>\nProsthetic valves or material (e.g. conduit IE, prosthetic shunts and\nintracardiac devices). >\n>\nTranscatheter valve implantation (e.g. transcatheter aortic valve\nimplantation; TAVI and pulmonary valve implantation; PVI). >\n>\nCIED infections. >\n>\nCHD. \u2022 Patients with indications for cardiac surgery (refer Section 5.1). \u2022 Patients with cardiac complications. >\n>\nValvular dysfunction especially of the left-sided valves. >\n>\nCardiac abscess (confirmed or suspected). >\n>\nCongestive heart failure. >\n>\nMetastatic infection. 4.0 MANAGEMENT\nSpecific situations that may need other non-cardiac consultations:\n\u2022 ID and microbiology:\n>\n>\nBCNIE. >\n>\nPersistent infection that is not responding to treatment. \u2022 Neurology/neurosurgery:\n>\n>\nPatients with neurological complications. \u2022 Haematology:\n>\n>\nPatients who are on anticoagulation with coagulopathies and haemorrhagic\ncomplications.

Patients with high predisposing risk for complications, with indications for\ncardiac surgery and with cardiac complications should ideally be referred\nto a SC. For referral of IE patients for specialist care:\n1. IE should be preferably managed by a multidisciplinary team with the\nnecessary expertise in endocarditis management. [IIa/B]\n2. Patients with complicated IE should be considered for referral to a SC. [IIa/C]\nRecommendations\n4.0 MANAGEMENT\n4.0 MANAGEMENT\n4.1.5 Pre-discharge management\nAll patients who have experienced an episode of IE remain at high-risk for recurrent\ninfection indefinitely (refer Appendix 1). Those with significant valvular regurgitation\nand/or cardiac lesions who have completed successful antimicrobial therapy may\nrequire eventual cardiac surgery. The assessment for timing of surgical intervention\ncan be guided by the clinical status and serial echocardiographic evaluation. Therefore, prior to discharge, patients who have had appropriate and effective\nmedical treatment and surgery (if necessary) should undergo the following:\n\u2022 Detailed physical assessment to document the clinical status (blood pressure,\nheart rate and rhythm should be documented). \u2022 Laboratory investigations e.g. inflammatory markers, FBC and serology\n(improving trend/resolution of infection). \u2022 Echocardiography to establish a new baseline (most often TTE is adequate). \u2022 Evaluation of toxicity resulting from prolonged antimicrobial use such as renal\nfunction, ototoxicity and diarrhoea (refer Section 4.2). \u2022 Counselling or rehabilitation for IVDU. \u2022 Education and counselling on:\n>\n>\nRecognition of relapsing infection e.g. fever, chills, rigors and the need for\nblood cultures BEFORE starting any antimicrobials (even oral ones).", "chunk_order": 42}

Beyond\n2 weeks of treatment consider OPAT service if patient is:\n\u2022 Medically stable. \u2022 Has no heart failure. \u2022 Has no neurological signs. \u2022 Has no renal impairment. \u2022 Has no high-risk cardiac features on echocardiogram (refer Section 3.3.1;\nTable 3.4). The hospital must have established OPAT services with trained staff and\nprotocols. Patients need to be reviewed daily by a trained nurse and by a doctor\nonce/twice a week. Some important parameters that should be reviewed are\npresented in Appendix 10. 5.0\nSURGICAL INTERVENTION\n5.1 Indications\nSurgical intervention is indicated in the following cases of IE:113-116\n\u2022 Severe valvular incompetence, haemodynamic instability or heart failure. \u2022 Uncontrolled sepsis and paravalvular extension of infection. \u2022 Fungal or multiresistant endocarditis. \u2022 Large vegetations (> 10 mm for left-sided IE) and recurrent systemic\nembolisation. A. Severe valvular incompetence, heart failure or haemodynamic\ninstability\nValvular regurgitation in NVE occurs as a result of:\n\u2022 Leaflet perforation. \u2022 Rupture of the leaflet supporting apparatus. \u2022 Interference of the vegetative mass with leaflet closure. \u2022 Intracardiac and extracardiac fistulas. \u2022 Valve obstruction of prosthetic valves by very large vegetations (rare). When acute and severe, heart failure and haemodynamic instability ensues. Surgery\nin these situations is life saving and has been shown to improve survival.114\nB. Persistent infection, uncontrolled sepsis and paravalvular extension of\ninfection\nSurgery is indicated when:\n\u2022 Fever or positive blood cultures persist despite appropriate antimicrobial\ntreatment after 5-7 days. \u2022 Extracardiac causes have been excluded. Paravalvular extension of IE is the most frequent cause of uncontrolled infection and\nis associated with a poor prognosis.

However in practice, surgery is often delayed in\nendocarditis due to:\n\u2022 High operative risk. \u2022 Possible risk of the newly implanted prosthetic valve getting infected. A recent meta-analysis involving 8,141 patients demonstrated that early surgery\nwithin 2 weeks of diagnosis improved both early mortality and long-term survival\ncompared with non-early surgery.126 In patients with cardiogenic shock, surgery\nshould be undertaken much earlier, within 24 hours of diagnosis.127 However, it\nmay be reasonable to delay surgery for 48 hours in a patient with septic shock\nto allow a period of stabilisation and better control of the sepsis with intravenous\nantimicrobials as cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in the presence of\nseptic shock carries an excessively high operative mortality.125,127\nIn selected patients, surgery can be carried out on an elective or semi-elective basis\nin the subacute or healed phase of endocarditis where the operative risk and the\nrisk of infection of the implanted valve prosthesis is lower.68,128 This is applicable for\nthe following patients:\n\u2022 Pre-existing chronic valvular regurgitation who are haemodynamically stable. \u2022 Vegetation is < 10 mm in size. \u2022 Well-controlled sepsis. 5.0 SURGICAL INTERVENTION\nA multidisciplinary team approach, comprising cardiologists, cardiac surgeons and\nID specialists is recommended when deciding on the indication and optimal timing\nfor surgical intervention. This approach has lowered overall morbidity and mortality\nfor IE. Patients with an indication for surgical intervention should be transferred to\na SC at the earliest opportunity where such a multidisciplinary approach can be\noffered. 5.2.1 Preventing systemic embolism\nMost emboli occur before the diagnosis of endocarditis and in the first 2 weeks\nthereafter; the embolic rate decreases significantly after 2-3 weeks of antimicrobial\ntherapy.17,61,67,129 There is emerging evidence for urgent surgery in preventing\nembolic events in those with large vegetations > 10 mm.130\nA randomised controlled trial of 76 patients with left-sided NVE comparing early\nversus late surgery in IE with large vegetations (> 10 mm) reported a lower\ncomposite rate of hospital deaths, embolic events and recurrent endocarditis at\n6 months with early surgery within 48 hours (3% versus 23%). The difference\nwas largely due to a reduction in embolic events with early surgery.116 Surgery\nundertaken for the prevention of systemic embolism should be performed urgently\nduring the first few days following initiation of antimicrobial therapy, as the risk of\nembolism is highest at this time.

However, the majority of these are subclinical and clinical stroke is diagnosed\nin only 25-29%.48,131\nThe risk of significant neurologic complications occurring as a result of cardiac surgery\nperformed early after a significant cerebral infarction is high:\n\u2022 Approximately 20% in the first 3 days. \u2022 20-50% between 4 and 14 days. \u2022 6-10% between 15 and 28 days. \u2022 < 1% after 28 days. Hospital mortality is also dependent on the time of cardiac surgical intervention after\na cerebral infarction; 66% when surgery is performed within 24 hours of a stroke,\nand gradually decreasing every week to 7% when surgery is performed more\nthan 4 weeks after a stroke.132 The risk of clinical deterioration is independently\nassociated with stroke severity. The recommended timing for valve surgery if indicated, following a cerebrovascular\nevent is as follows:\n\u2022 Without delay:\n>\n>\nIn the presence of subclinical cerebral emboli or small cerebral infarcts\nwithout severe neurological damage. >\n>\nAbsence of cerebral haemorrhage. \u2022 Delayed for at least 2 weeks:\n>\n>\nIn the presence of major ischaemic strokes, if more urgent surgery is\nindicated e.g. due to congestive heart failure, progressive decline in cardiac\nfunction or uncontrolled infection. >\n>\nAbsence of cerebral haemorrhage. >\n>\nAreas of brain infarction are small. 5.0 SURGICAL INTERVENTION\n5.0 SURGICAL INTERVENTION\n\u2022 Delayed for at least 4 weeks:\n>\n>\nIn the presence of major ischaemic strokes. >\n>\nIn the presence of major intracranial haemorrhage (> 2 cm in diameter):\n\u00bb\u00bb\nThis reduces the risk of cerebral haemorrhage during cardiac surgery on\ncardiopulmonary bypass with systemic heparinisation.79\n\u00bb\u00bb\nIn one study, hospital mortality was 75% when performed within 4\nweeks of a haemorrhagic stroke compared to 40% when surgery was\nperformed after 4 weeks.80\nSurgical indication for patients with cerebral infarction or\nhaemorrhage:\n1.

Right-sided IE\nresolves with conservative treatment in most cases and surgery is not commonly\nperformed. The insertion of a prosthetic valve is generally avoided as much as\npossible in these cases as the majority of these patients are IVDUs and the risk\nof subsequent infection of an implanted valve prosthesis is high with continued\nintravenous drug use. 5.3.2.1 Indications for surgery\nSurgery is indicated in the following situations:\n\u2022 Persistent infection due to difficult to eradicate microorganisms not\nresponding to antimicrobial therapy beyond 2 weeks.133\n\u2022 Persistent vegetation size > 20 mm and recurrent septic pulmonary\nemboli despite appropriate antimicrobials.134,135\n\u2022 Massive or worsening tricuspid regurgitation causing right heart failure\nunresponsive to medical therapy. \u2022 Failure or complications of percutaneous removal of infected pacing\nwires. S.aureus infections are often complicated with large vegetations, aggressive\nvalve destruction and embolic manifestations resulting in an increased risk\nof mortality.

[I/C]\nRecommendations\n5.4 Principles of surgery\nThe surgical principles in IE are well established. Pre-operative assessment and management would include:\n\u2022 Investigating and treating the primary source responsible for the endocarditis. \u2022 Treatment of extracardiac sepsis such as splenic and paravertebral abscesses\neither by splenectomy140 or percutaneous drainage to avoid infection of the\nnew valve. \u2022 Investigating and managing cerebrovascular events for those at risk. \u2022 Dental consultation. Pre-operative workup should therefore include imaging of the brain, chest, abdomen\nand pelvis, and maxillofacial area. Some important surgical strategies are:\n\u2022 Wherever possible valve repair rather than replacement is preferred. Valve repair:\n>\n>\nImproves in-hospital and long-term survival. >\n>\nHas better preservation of ventricular function. >\n>\nEliminates the risk of prosthetic valve-related complications compared with\nvalve replacement. >\n>\nDecreases the risk of infection of the newly implanted prosthetic valve.79,141\n\u2022 Complete removal and radical debridement of all infected and necrotic\nmaterial, leaving only healthy tissue, which will hold suture. \u2022 To avoid excessive manipulation of the heart prior to going on cardiopulmonary\nbypass to prevent embolisation of the vegetations. \u2022 Reconstruction using autologous or bovine pericardium, or dacron, if\nnecessary, avoiding prosthetic material if possible.79,125,142\n\u2022 Vegetations/cardiac tissue sent for Gram stain, cultures and for HPE (refer\nSections 3.2.2 & 3.2.3, and Appendix 5). \u2022 The choice of valve prosthesis type is based on the usual considerations when\ndeciding between a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve i.e. age, life expectancy,\nco-morbidities and compliance with anticoagulation therapy. There is no\ndifference in the risk of infection between mechanical or bioprosthetic\nvalves.79,142,143\n\u2022 Bioprosthetic valve replacement rather than mechanical valve replacement\nshould be considered in the presence of mycotic cerebral aneurysms identified\nby imaging studies pre-operatively to avoid the need for anticoagulation postoperatively. \u2022 Post-operative anticoagulation management should be reviewed and managed\naccordingly in those with cerebrovascular complications. \u2022 Antimicrobials should be continued to complete a total course of 6 weeks in\nmost cases.

In the presence of periannular abscess, it may be necessary to reconstruct the\naortic annulus using autologous or bovine pericardium, or dacron. In most cases, it\nis possible to suture a valve prosthesis onto the reconstructed annulus. An aortic root replacement with a homograft or stentless root is a good option when\naortic root replacement is necessary.79,144\n5.4.2 Mitral valve\nWhenever possible, repair rather than replacement of destroyed mitral valves should\nbe undertaken. Successful repair of the mitral valve in IE is often possible with the\nright expertise, which may require repair of the leaflet perforation or augmentation\nwith pericardial patch and use of artificial neochordae. However, complete and radical debridement of all infected tissue remains the key\nprinciple and should not be compromised to repair the mitral valve. If mitral valve\nreplacement is necessary, complete preservation of the subvalvular apparatus\nshould be performed. 5.4.3 Tricuspid valve\nWhenever possible, repair rather than replacement of destroyed tricuspid valves\nis preferable. When valve repair is not possible and replacement is necessary,\nthe choice of prosthesis should follow the same algorithm as in patients without\nendocarditis. In IVDUs, it may be reasonable to use a bioprosthetic valve if there is\nconcern about compliance with anticoagulation medication.79\n5.4.4 Periannular extension\nWhere abscess cavities are present, these must be drained, necrotic tissue excised\nand any fistulous tracts closed where appropriate.

However there are some important principles to consider in the paediatric or\nCHD population. \u2022 Preserving the native valve is important in children. \u2022 Early intervention favours the preservation of the native annulus. \u2022 Surgery aims at valve repair rather than replacement:\n>\n>\nMitral valve debridement and repair using Carpentier techniques offer\nexcellent survival, freedom from re-operation and late function status.147\n>\n>\nIf aortic valve replacement is required, the Ross operation is effective for\npatients with annular or root abscesses.145\n\u2022 Endocarditis involving the VSD patch should undergo replacement of the\npatch. \u2022 Right ventricular to pulmonary artery conduit have to be replaced to prevent\nabscess formation and pulmonary embolisation. The surgical mortality for IE in the group of CHD has been reported between 10-15%. Mortality is higher in premature infants and in the presence of fungal endocarditis.149\nProphylactic surgery to prevent a primary embolic event is not recommended given\nthe lack of proven benefit and long-term risks of valve replacement in childhood.145\n5.0 SURGICAL INTERVENTION\nPrinciples of surgical intervention in the paediatric CHD patients:\n1. Degree of illness not be considered a limitation to surgical intervention,\nbecause the alternative, to delay or defer surgery, can have dire\nconsequences. [I/B]\n2.

More paediatric patients with CHD are\nsurviving to adulthood.153-155\nSurgery may eliminate the risk of IE in patients with simple shunts with no residual\nlesions. However, in complex congenital lesions, due to the use of prosthetic\nmaterial, palliative shunts and long-term sequelae of the post-operative course,\nthe risk of IE is increased.156-158 The risk of IE in patients with CHD increases with\nage. The cumulative incidence of post-operative IE in adults with CHD ranges\nbetween 1% and 6% at 10 and 25 years follow-up respectively, and varies based\non the different heart defects.157 Cumulative incidence of IE post-aortic valve\nstenosis repair at 25 years was however, unusually high at about 13%.157 Based\non a prediction model of IE risk in adults with CHD, the cumulative observed\nrisk of IE is 2.4% at 40 years old and 4.7% at 60 years of age.159 In developing\ncountries, IE complicates unrepaired CHD, cyanotic heart defects and those who\nhave had palliative procedures.160-163\n7.1.1 Epidemiology\nMost available data are from single large centres, based on in-patient findings. A\npopulation based review of the Quebec CHD Database from 1988 to 2010 reported\nthat the cumulative incidence of IE from birth to 18 years was 6.1 first cases per\n1,000 children which corresponded to an incidence rate of 4.1 per 10,000 personyears,164 which is lower than the overall incidence of IE in adults with CHD, reported\nas 11 per 10,000 person-years.159 In a Japanese survey of hospitalised patients\nfrom 66 institutions (1997-2001), the prevalence of IE in CHD was 0.42%.165\nThe mean age of IE in children with CHD was 8.4 years (range 10 days-17 years)\nand in the adult patient with CHD it ranged between 16.8-32.5 years.160,165,166 There\nwas a male preponderance (1.5:1).159,165,167 IE in CHD occurred more commonly on\nthe right side and was highest up to 6 months post-intervention.165,167,168\nGram-positive cocci are the common aetiological agents of IE in children; VGS is\nmost common followed by S.", "chunk_order": 63}

A thorough history, physical examination and investigations (imaging,\nblood cultures, microbiological tests and HPE) should be done to make the\ndiagnosis (refer Chapter 3.0). S. Aureus bacteraemia is one of the major criteria in the modified Duke\ncriteria irrespective of the cause and is the most common pathogenesis of\nbacteraemia in the presence of central venous catheters.56 Removal of the\ncentral venous catheters in those with prolonged bacteraemia is advised\nbefore the diagnosis of IE.179 The associated use of hyperalimentation and\nhigh glucose concentrations with central venous catheter has contributed to\nthe increase in Candida spp. IE in neonates. BCNIE although less common,\ncan also occur. It is usually due to either previous antimicrobial treatment\nor fastidious microorganisms. The diagnosis and management of BCNIE is\nsimilar to the adult and is described in Chapters 3 and 4. TTE is more sensitive (97%) in young patients (weight < 60 kg) compared to\nadult patients in detecting endocarditis. However for those patients who are\nobese, have prosthetic grafts, valves and conduits, chest deformities, and\nin those with hyperinflated lungs or compromised respiratory function, TEE\nserves as an important adjunct (refer Section 3.3).180\n7.2.3.2 Treatment of infective endocarditis in paediatric patients\nThe management of IE in paediatric patients and IE in CHD is predominantly\nby medical treatment and the choice of antimicrobials will depend on the\nmicroorganism cultured (refer Section 4.2).", "chunk_order": 67}

Although infrequent, one important complication of TAVI is IE. IE\nfor TAVI is classified according to the modified Duke criteria.186 Patients with high\nclinical suspicion of TAVI related PVE should be referred to specialist centres\n(refer Section 4.1.4). In patients who have had TAVI and who develop prolonged\nfever, valve murmur or new valvular regurgitation, a TTE should be performed. Since images may be suboptimal due to acoustic shadows, a TEE should also be\nconsidered in order to obtain clearer views of the prosthetic valve. In the major PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial, PVE\noccurred at a similar rate in the surgical and transcatheter groups (1.5% and 1.0%\nrespectively, p = 0.61).187 Two varieties of valves; the Edwards SAPIEN (Edwards\nLifesciences Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) and Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic Inc.,\nMinneapolis, MN, USA) have had reported cases of PVE.188\nIn IE with TAVI, patients have had positive blood cultures with a microbiological\nprofile typical to that previously documented in surgical bioprosthetic PVE;\nEnterococcus spp.,CoNS, S. aureus and Streptococcus spp.188 The incidence\nof PVE may also be increased by patient risk factors such as diabetes mellitus,\noral hygiene and adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis for dental procedures.188\nAntimicrobial prophylaxis for TAVI patients is recommended as in Chapter 8.0.

Clinical presentation is often vague and non-specific and thus a high index of clinical\nsuspicion is mandated.193 CIED IE must always be considered in the presence of\nunexplained fever in a patient with a CIED. Patients who develop fever or blood\nstream infection with no obvious source, should be referred back to the primary\ncentre responsible for the implantation. Patients should be educated regarding\nthese risks. Echocardiography and blood cultures (refer Sections 3.2 & 3.3) are the mainstay\nfor the diagnosis of CIED IE. TTE may identify lead vegetation and tricuspid valve\ninvolvement. However, a negative TTE does not rule out CIED IE, hence it is\nrecommended to proceed to a TEE examination. TEE is more sensitive and specific\nto TTE for diagnosis of lead-related endocarditis. Considering their complementary role, it is preferable to perform both investigations\nin cases of suspected CIED IE, as a TTE at time of diagnosis may be used as baseline\nfor additional studies during the course of the illness. In cases where the clinical\nsuspicion is still high but cardiac imaging with TTE and TEE yields no evidence of\nendocarditis (false negative) other imaging modality such as radiolabelled leucocyte\nscintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning may prove useful.194-196 Repeated TEE\nis not necessary after completion of treatment.

In the\npresence of lead vegetation on echocardiography, urgent referral back to the\nprimary implantation centre should be considered at this time point, if not done\nso at priori. Complete hardware removal is advocated and if required, a temporary\ndevice is implanted until the infection is resolved.189,202 Careful assessment of new\nimplantation strategy must be considered prior to removal in patients whom are\n\u201cdevice-dependent\u201d. Blood cultures should be obtained within 24 hours after\nhardware removal for evidence of microorganism clearance from bloodstream.

In the\nensuing years, whilst there was a very significant fall in antimicrobial prophylaxis\nprescribing, there was also a significant increase in the incidence of IE. In 2016, NICE\nreviewed the evidence and concluded that there was no requirement to change\nthe existing CG64 guidance and emphasised that antimicrobial prophylaxis against\nIE is not recommended routinely for people undergoing dental, gastrointestinal\ntract, genitourinary and respiratory tract procedures. Additionally, these guidelines\nemphasised prevention rather than prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of IE. It is however, the consensus view of this writing committee that antimicrobial\nprophylaxis is administered to all patients at high-risk for IE including those with\nestablished rheumatic heart disease who are undergoing invasive dental and\nsurgical procedures. 8.2 Cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of infective\nendocarditis\nPatients with cardiac conditions listed in Table 8.1 are considered as being at\nincreased risk of developing IE and are indicated for antimicrobial prophylaxis.", "chunk_order": 72}

[IIa/B]\nRecommendation\n8.3 Antimicrobial prophylaxis for specific procedures\nAntimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent IE is indicated in high-risk cardiac patients prior\nto selected dental and non-dental procedures. Any procedure where antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated for surgical reasons,\nthe pre-procedural antimicrobial prophylaxis is normally adequate as IE prophylaxis\nin high-risk cardiac cases. In procedures where pre-procedural antimicrobial\nprophylaxis is not routinely given, cardiac patients considered as high-risk should\nreceive antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to procedures expected to produce\nbacteraemia as discussed in Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1 Dental procedures\nThe estimated incidence of IE is about 1 per 150,000 dental procedures with\nantimicrobials prophylaxis and 1 per 46,000 for procedures unprotected by\nantimicrobials.208 For patients considered as high-risk (Table 8.1), antimicrobial\nprophylaxis is recommended for invasive dental procedures that involve manipulation\nof the gingival or periapical region of the teeth or oral mucosa.

Wide dissemination via soft copy (available from http://www.moh.gov.my, http://www. acadmed.org.my, http://www.malaysianheart.org/) will facilitate the implementation\nof this CPG. However, the limited knowledge in the effective management of the\ndisease and the varied treatment practice among HCP may be its main barriers. The successful implementation of this CPG would require:\n\u2022 Continuous medical education (CME) and training on the most effective means\nof diagnosing IE in patients via regular seminars, lectures, CME meetings and\ncase sharing. These would include:\n>\n>\nHow to recognise findings in patients that should trigger high clinical\nsuspicion of IE. >\n>\nHow to effectively confirm the diagnosis of IE. >\n>\nHow and when to institute appropriate antimicrobial therapy. >\n>\nWhen to refer patients to a SC for further management and cardiac surgery. \u2022 Effort to set up an effective referral process in the different states from primary\ncare centres to SC (refer Section 4.1.4). \u2022 The availability of this CPG to all healthcare professionals from primary care\ncentres to tertiary institutions offering speciality and subspecialty care through\nelectronic websites. \u2022 The availability of Quick Reference (QR) guides both through printed copies\nand electronic websites as an easy yet comprehensive tool for the prevention,\ndiagnosis and management of IE.

Identify the site of venepuncture where blood is to be drawn. 2. Wash your hands using soap and water, then dry or apply an alcohol hand\nrub. 3. Put on a pair of sterile gloves. 4. Cleanse the site of the venepuncture with 70% isopropyl alcohol, allowing it to\nair dry. 5. Disinfect the skin of site on a circle approximately 5 cm in diameter with\nchlorhexidine gluconate in alcohol, rubbing vigorously for at least 30 seconds. Allow to air dry. 6. To prevent contamination, do not palpate the disinfected venepuncture site. 7. Perform venepuncture. 8. Draw blood using a sterile needle and syringe or a blood collection device. 9. Prior to use, examine the blood culture bottles for evidence of damage or\ndeterioration (discoloration). 10. Check the expiry date printed on each blood culture bottle. Discard bottles\nthat have expired. 11. Recommended volume of blood (OR follow manufacturer\u2019s instruction):\na. Adult: 10 ml of blood into each culture bottle (aerobic/anaerobic bottles). b. Paediatric: 1-5 ml of blood in paediatric blood culture bottle. 12. Disinfect the rubber septum on the blood culture bottles with 70% isopropyl\nalcohol using fresh alcohol prep for each container. Allow bottle tops to dry to\nfully disinfect. 13. Using a transfer device or a fresh sterile needle, aseptically transfer the blood\ninto the blood culture bottles as soon as possible. 14. If the amount of blood drawn is less than the recommended volume, the\nblood should be inoculated into the aerobic bottle first, since aerobic and\nfacultative bacteria cause most bacteraemia. Any remaining blood should then\nbe inoculated into the anaerobic bottle. 15. Invert the blood culture bottles gently several times to prevent clotting. 16.
