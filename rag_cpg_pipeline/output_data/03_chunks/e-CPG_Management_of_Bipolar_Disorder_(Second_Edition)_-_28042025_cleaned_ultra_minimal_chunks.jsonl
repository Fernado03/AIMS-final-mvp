The guideline should not override the responsibility of\nthe practitioners to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of\nthe individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and\ntheir families or guardians, taking into account the management options\navailable locally. UPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2024 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2028) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When\nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

Management of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\nii\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe following recommendations are highlighted by the CPG\nDevelopment Group (DG) as the key recommendations that answer\nthe main questions addressed in the CPG and should be prioritised for\nimplementation. DIAGNOSIS\n\u2022 Bipolar disorder should be diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition, Text Revision\n(DSM- 5-TR) or International Classification of Diseases Eleventh\nRevision (ICD- 11). TREATMENT AND MONITORING\n\u2022 Antipsychotics or mood stabilisers, either as monotherapy or\ncombination, should be used to treat acute mania or depressive\nepisodes in bipolar disorder (BD). \u2022 Antidepressants may be used as short-term adjunctive treatment but\nnot as monotherapy in acute bipolar depression. \u2022 In BD with specifiers:\n\uf0a1 atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) or mood stabilisers may be used\nas monotherapy or combination therapy in mixed features\n\uf0a1 AAPs may be used in anxious distress\n\uf0a1 combination of mood stabilisers with AAPs or another mood\nstabiliser is the preferred treatment of choice in rapid cycling\n\uf0a1 antidepressants should be avoided in mixed features and used\nwith caution in rapid cycling\n\u2022 For maintenance pharmacotherapy of BD:\n\uf0a1 lithium and quetiapine are the preferred first-line monotherapy\nwhile lithium plus quetiapine or aripiprazole are the preferred firstline combination therapy\n\uf0a1 antidepressant monotherapy should be avoided\n\uf0a1 aripiprazole or risperidone long-acting injectables may be\nconsidered in patients who have poor adherence to oral\nmedications especially in preventing manic episodes\n\u2022 Serum lithium level should be monitored one week upon initiation or\ndose change and every six months or earlier if indicated in BD. \u2022 Electroconvulsive therapy should be considered in both bipolar\nmanic and depressive episodes in indicated situations. \u2022 Psychosocial interventions and psychotherapies should be offered\nas an adjunctive treatment for BD. Management of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\niii\nRELAPSE PREVENTION AND ADHERENCE\n\u2022 Psychosocial interventions and psychotherapies should be part of\nstrategies in relapse prevention of bipolar disorder.", "chunk_order": 2}

SPECIAL POPULATION\n\u2022 Shared decision-making in weighing the risks versus benefits of\npharmacological treatment should be done in pregnant and lactating\nwomen with bipolar disorder (BD). \uf0a1 Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) may be used in pregnancy. \uf0a1 Valproate and carbamazepine should be avoided in pregnancy\ngiven their teratogenic risks. Other mood stabilisers should be\nused with caution. \u2022 For children and adolescents with BD:\n\uf0a1 AAPs monotherapy may be used in manic or mixed episodes\n\uf0a1 lurasidone and olanzapine/fluoxetine combination may be used in\ndepressive episodes\n\u2022 Patients with BD with co-morbid substance use disorder should be\nreferred to psychiatric services. Management of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the DG for this CPG were from the Ministry of Health\n(MoH), Ministry of Higher Education and the private sector. There was\nactive involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during\nthe process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and others\ne.g. Pubmed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria includes everyone at risk and with bipolar disorder\n(BD) regardless of study design. The first search was limited to\nliterature published in the last eight years (2014 until 2022) on humans\nand in English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature\nand guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted for studies related to the issues\naddressed. All initial searches were conducted from 2 August 2022\nto 17 August 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31 December 2023 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat.

Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists\n(RANZCP) - The 2020 RANZCP Clinical Practice Guidelines for\nMood Disorders (2020)\nA total of 18 main clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG\nmembers met 27 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using\nthe Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and\nManagement of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion\nwere resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely on the\nfindings of systematic reviews/meta-analyses and clinical trials, with\nlocal practices taken into consideration. The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2015) while the\ngrading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE\nas much as possible (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the\nCPG followed strictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II. Upon completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It\nwas also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from\nany interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology Assessment\n(HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and approval. Details on the CPG development by MaHTAS can be obtained from the\nManual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based\nClinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at https://\nwww.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/CPG_MANUAL_MAHTAS.pdf).

INTRODUCTION\nBipolar disorder (BD) is a potentially life-long disabling condition\npresenting commonly as either bipolar I disorder (BD I) or bipolar II\ndisorder (BD II). BD I is characterised by episodes of mania (abnormally\nelevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with severe\nfunctional impairment or psychotic symptoms for seven days or more). On the other hand, BD II is characterised by episodes of hypomania\n(abnormally elevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with\ndecreased or increased function for four days or more) and depressive\nepisodes. BD is a severe mental disorder. Based on World Health Organisation\n(WHO) statistics in 2019, its global prevalence was estimated to be\naround 40 million.1 In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, the\nprevalence of BD showed an increasing trend from 24.8 million in 1990\nto 39.5 million in 2019.2 Its prevalence in Malaysia, however, is not\nwell-established. BD is associated with reduced functioning, cognitive\nimpairment and decreased quality of life (QoL). It is also one of the\nleading causes of disability in young people and increased mortality,\nespecially by suicide.3\nDiagnosis of BD may be difficult given the complexity of its clinical\npresentation which may overlap with other psychiatric disorders and\nchange over time. Moreover, managing BD is limited by the lack of\nresources including expertise and medications. Poor adherence\nremains a major issue that needs to be tackled in its management. The first edition of the CPG Management of BD in Adults was published\nin 2014. Since then, there have been advances in the management\nof BD which include wider medication choices and new treatment\nmodalities that incorporate technological advancement. This revised edition provides updates on the evidence and related\nrecommendations on the current management of BD, keeping in mind\nthe acceptability of the treatment and availability of resources. It also\naddresses the management of children and adolescents, and looks\ninto evidence on psychospirituality as well as complementary and\nalternative medicine. Previous topics on psychosocial interventions,\nsuicide prevention and management in pregnant and lactating women\nare further expanded. This CPG is aimed to be used at primary, secondary, and tertiary health\ncare settings. It is also useful for those involved in psychiatric training.

TREATMENT\nThere are several treatment options in BD, including pharmacological\ninterventions, psychotherapies and physical therapies. Ideally, treatment\nneeds to be individualised and patient-centered, focusing on patientrelated outcomes. 4.1. Pharmacotherapy\nPharmacological treatment is one of the main pillars in the management\nof BD. There is ample evidence on the effectiveness of treatment in\nacute mood episodes and the prevention of relapses in the maintenance\nphase. Medications with mood-stabilising properties include lithium, antiepileptic\nagents (e.g. valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), haloperidol and\nAAPs. Choice of medications is based on the effectiveness, safety,\navailability and affordability of the medication, concomitant medications,\nresponse to previous medication, family history of medication response,\npatient preference as well as medical and psychiatric co-morbidities. Refer to Appendix 5 on Recommended Adult Medication Dosages\nand Adverse Effects For Bipolar Disorder. \u2022 Response to treatment is defined as a \u226550% reduction of total score\nin standardised rating scales. \u2022 Remission is an outcome of effectiveness measured by varying cutoff points in standardised scales used in clinical trials. 4.1.1.

The presence of mixed features is associated\nwith poorer outcomes e.g. increased time in illness, poorer response\nto treatment and suicidality.42 Management of mixed features is\nchallenging as it needs to address both mania/hypomania and\ndepressive symptoms that occur simultaneously. Despite its common\nprevalence in BD, there is a paucity of RCTs on pharmacological\nintervention of mixed features.43\nIn a systematic review of six international clinical guidelines on the\ntreatment of mixed states in mood disorders mainly BD among the adult\npopulation, the recommended treatments are summarised in the table\nbelow:\nManagement of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\nThe same review recommended that antidepressants should be\navoided in mixed episodes.

Supported employment is an intervention to help individuals with\nsevere mental illness including BD to secure and maintain meaningful\nwork. Its principles include competitive employment, rapid job search\nand attention to patients\u2019 preferences, among many others.77 NICE\nguideline recommends that people with severe mental illness including\nBD who wish to find work receive supported employment services.73\nThese services are available in places e.g. community mental health\ncentres (MENTARI) or in local psychiatric services. List of available\nMENTARI can be accessed via https://mentari.moh.gov.my/ mentariminds/. 4.2.3. Psychotherapy\nPsychotherapy has been used as adjunctive to pharmacotherapy for\nBD. These include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family-focused\ntherapy (FFT), interpersonal and social rhythms therapy (IPSRT),\nmindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and dialectical behaviour\ntherapy (DBT). Different types of psychotherapies can address various\naspects of the condition, helping patients cope with mood swings,\nmanage stress and improve overall functioning.

Strategies to Improve Adherence\nAdherence to treatment within patients with BD may change over time\nand vary between different pharmacotherapies. About half of patients\nwith BD become non-adherent during long-term treatment.95, level I Nonadherence in BD is a complex phenomenon determined by a multitude\nof factors. Significant risk factors for non-adherence are:6\n\u2022 difficulties with medication routines\n\u2022 negative attitudes towards drugs in general\n\u2022 depressive polarity of the last acute episode\n\u2022 presence of subsyndromal symptoms\n\u2022 co-morbid obsessive-compulsive disorder\n\u2022 current acute episode\n\u2022 substance abuse/dependence\n\u2022 younger age\n\u2022 AEs\nEnhancing adherence involves employing various approaches, which\nare psychological interventions, personalised adherence enhancement,\ntechnology- assisted strategies and community-based care which are\ndiscussed below. Management of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\n7.2.1. Psychological interventions\nThe most frequently studied intervention for enhancing adherence is\npsychoeducation. In a large NMA assessing non-adherence in patients with BD on\npharmacotherapy, a lower risk of non-adherence was found among\nthose who received psychoeducation alone (RR=0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to\n0.53) or a combination of psychoeducation and CBT (RR=0.14, 95%\nCI 0.02 to 0.85) compared with TAU. The author concluded that many\nadjunctive psychosocial interventions lacked high-quality evidence to\nsupport their effectiveness which includes adherence.93, level I\nA meta-analysis of 18 RCTs among adults with BD on pharmacotherapy,\npsychological interventions (e.g. family-focused therapy, CBT, cognitive\npsychoeducation therapy (CPT), psychoeducation] were more effective\nthan control in improving medication adherence (OR=2.27, 95% CI\n1.45 to 3.56).23, level I There was a mixture of quality of primary papers\nbased on RoB. In an RCT of adults with BD on mood stabilisers, multifaceted interventions\nthat include motivational interviewing and psychoeducation were more\neffective than control in improving adherence at 1- and 6-month postintervention as indicated by a higher Medication Adherence Rating\nScale (MARS) score and plasma level of mood stabilisers.96, level I\n7.2.2. Customised adherence enhancement\nCustomised adherence enhancement (CAE) is a module that combines\nthe following strategies:97, level II-3\n\u2022 psychoeducation which includes information on BD and its\nneurobiological facets, medication management and creation of\nan individualised symptom profile to detect early signs of relapse\n\u2022 modified motivational enhancement therapy where the overall\ngoal is to enhance personal motivation to increase the likelihood\nof medication adherence\n\u2022 communication with providers where individuals are supported\nwith discussions on the crucial aspects of treatment planning\nincluding expectations for medication response and concerns\nabout medication AEs\n\u2022 medication routines that aim to help individuals adjust their\ntreatment plans as needed and engage in discussions with\nhealthcare providers.

Technology-assisted strategies\nThe technology-assisted strategies that are explored in adherencerelated intervention studies include medication event monitoring system\n(MEMS), short messaging service (SMS) and android smartphonebased self-monitoring system (MONARCA System) which are described\nbelow. In an RCT on medication adherence among poorly adherent individuals\nwith BD, MEMS bottle caps detected worse adherence compared with\nself-report TRQ (66.43% vs 46.61%) with a correlation between them of\n0.47 (p<0.01).

Community-based care\nThere was limited evidence on adherence interventions for BD patients\nconducted in the community setting. A pre-post study of a Life Goal Program (a structured group psychotherapy\nprogramme) delivered at three community mental health centres\ndemonstrated a significant increase in knowledge about BD among the\nparticipants with a large effect size (Cohen\u2019s d= 0.85) compared with\nbaseline.

SPECIAL POPULATION\n8.1. Pregnancy and Lactation\nThere is a high risk of relapse of BD during pregnancy or the postpartum period especially in patients not on treatment. There is,\nhowever, the issue of specific considerations to be given on the use\nof medications during these periods based on the new Pregnancy and\nLactation Labelling Final Rule of the US Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) as shown in Appendix 9. If medications are deemed necessary,\npreference should be given to monotherapy using the lowest effective\ndose.40\nGiven the complexity of BD management in this group of women, it is\nadvisable to co-manage them with the obstetrics team. Risks-benefits\nanalysis of medications on both women and the developing foetus and\ninfant should be done with the patients using a shared decision-making\napproach. The Guidelines on Pre-Pregnancy Care in MOH Specialist Hospital\nsuggest that all women of reproductive age with BD should be referred\nto a pre-pregnancy care team to optimise their mental health condition\nbefore conception, pregnancy and lactation.108\nIn a large meta-analysis of six cohort studies, the use of lithium in\npregnancy showed NS difference in risk of:109, level II-2\n\u2022 diabetes in pregnancy\n\u2022 pre-eclampsia\n\u2022 small for gestational age\n\u2022 major malformations including cardiac malformations\n\u2022 foetal distress\n\u2022 caesarean section\n\u2022 preterm birth\n\u2022 low birth weight\n\u2022 post-partum hemorrhage\nHowever, there was a small risk of neonatal admission to a special care\nbaby unit prior to 28 days of age (OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.33).", "chunk_order": 34}

Additionally, children exposed to valproate prenatally\nshowed higher rates of low Intelligence Quotient (IQ),\nneurodevelopmental deficits, reduced verbal abilities, attention\ndeficit hyperkinetic disorder and autism spectrum disorder. \uf0a1 Carbamazepine use was associated with teratogenicity e.g. neural tube defects, craniofacial abnormalities, etc. Since 2020, the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA)\nhas endorsed the use of the Annual Risk Acknowledgment form for\nvalproate in women with BD in child-bearing ages (refer to Appendix\n10a and 10b). There is insufficient evidence on the safety profile of APs use in BD\nwith pregnancy. However, RANZCP guidelines state that AAPs e.g. quetiapine or olanzapine can be used in the treatment of BD with\npregnancy as they are generally considered to be safe aside from a\nrisk of gestational diabetes and having a large baby.39\nIn a systematic review of case series/reports, ECT use in first trimester\nof pregnancy showed no safety concerns for the mother or foetus\nincluding teratogenicity.111, level III\nIn another systematic review of mainly case series/reports on mood\nstabilisers and APs use in lactation, the findings were:112, level II-2\n\u2022 carbamazepine, valproate, quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone\nwere relatively safe either due to their limited passage into breast\nmilk or low infant plasma concentrations\n\u2022 lamotrigine had high variability in infants\u2019 plasma concentration but\nno serious AEs and thus can be considered for individual cases\n\u2022 lithium was a possible treatment option although there was high\nvariability of transfer into breast milk\n\u2022 other AAPs e.g. aripiprazole, paliperidone, lurasidone, ziprasidone\nand asenapine were not recommended due to the scarcity of data\nManagement of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\nRecommendation 10\n\u2022 Shared decision-making in weighing the risks versus benefits of\npharmacological treatment should be done in pregnant and lactating\nwomen with bipolar disorder. \uf0a1 Atypical antipsychotics e.g. olanzapine and quetiapine may be\nused in pregnancy. \uf0a1 Valproate and carbamazepine should be avoided in pregnancy\ngiven their teratogenic risks.", "chunk_order": 35}

Those with BD need to be referred to psychiatric services for accurate\ndiagnosis and further management. The pharmacological treatment that\nhad been recommended by the CPG is not readily available in some\nhealthcare facilities. The financial burden of psychotropic treatments\nrestricts treatment options and distribution, while a scarcity of clinical\npsychologists limits access to essential psychosocial interventions. The\navailable psychoeducational materials for patients fall short in effectively\nfostering early help-seeking tendencies and offering comprehensive\nmanagement strategies. In line with the key recommendations in this CPG, the following are\nproposed as clinical audit indicators for quality management of BD:\nManagement of Bipolar Disorder (Second Edition)\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval\nof the CPG by MoH which include a Quick Reference and a Training\nModule.", "chunk_order": 42}

Infants who are preterm, dehydrated or have an infection should\nreceive hydration and be assessed for lithium toxicity. \u2022 As maternal lithium requirements and dosage may be increased\nduring pregnancy, maternal serum levels should be monitored\nfrequently postpartum and dosage reduced as necessary to avoid\nexcessive infant exposure via breastmilk. \u2022 If infant\u2019s serum lithium level is elevated, reducing the percentage of\nbreastfeeding can decrease it. \u2022 **RID: 0 - 30%. \u2022 Monitoring:\n\u25cb Monitor infant for lethargy, growth and feeding problems. \u25cb Monitor infant serum lithium, serum creatinine, BUN and TSH if\nclinical concerns arise. \u25cb\nValproate\n\u2022 CONTRAINDICATED and an alternative treatment should be\ndecided on, with appropriate specialist consultation, for\nwomen planning pregnancy. \u2022 High teratogenic potential and children exposed in-utero to\nvalproate have a high risk congenital malformations and\nneurodevelopmental disorders. \u2022 POSSIBLE TO USE IN LACTATION.", "chunk_order": 71}
