Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n1\nSTATEMENT OF INTENT\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nThe previous clinical practice guidelines for the management\nof stable angina were issued in 2010. Since then, there have\nbeen advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the\nmanagement of this progressive disease. Therefore, it is timely\nfor the publication of this CPG, with a title that is now evolved\nfrom stable angina to that of stable coronary artery disease (SCAD). Atherosclerosis is a systemic vascular disease, but it is in the\ncoronary arteries where this progressive disease exerts its\nmost serious effects which can significantly affect morbidity\nand mortality. Clinical manifestation of SCAD, by means of stable angina, has long been the point\nwhereby an individual begins to seek medical attention. However, the combination of\nearlier screening by an increasingly greater number of the general population at risk of\ncoronary artery disease has seen more patients being diagnosed with the subclinical\nSCAD. The high prevalence of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in Malaysia,\nincluding diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking, and the emergence of\nbetter diagnostic equipment have both contributed to this effect.", "chunk_order": 0}

The high prevalence of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in Malaysia,\nincluding diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking, and the emergence of\nbetter diagnostic equipment have both contributed to this effect. In both subclinical and clinically evident SCAD, there are now new drugs and non-drug\ninterventions available, which are now more readily available compared to when this\nlast CPG was published. In addition, new clinical evidence have emerged on these\nnew therapies. In this respect, the publication of this CPG, which reviews published\nresearch on these new therapies and strategies, is timely. The management of SCAD has to be tailored carefully to an individual, as the right\ntherapeutic strategies often improves symptoms. This CPG reviews most available\ntreatment options in Malaysia and makes recommendations on strategies that can\nimprove both the patients\u2019 clinical outcomes and quality of life.

This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or left\nventricular (LV) dysfunction. This CPG on Stable CAD has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the\nNational Heart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy\nof Medicine. It comprises cardiologists, endocrinologists, general and family\nphysicians and consultant internal medicine physicians and pharmacists from the\nPublic Health Division, government and private hospitals and the universities.

Objectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to provide guidance on:\n\uf0d8 the diagnosis of CAD in individuals presenting with stable chest symptoms. \uf0d8 the risk stratification of individuals who are diagnosed with CAD. This helps\ndetermine the need for revascularization guided by the patient\u2019s preferences. \uf0d8 optimal medical therapy (OMT) in all individuals with CAD. \uf0d8 revascularization strategies. Process:\nA review of current medical literature on Stable CAD for the last 10 years was\nperformed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases\n- PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.The search was conducted\nfor the period January 2006 till 31st August 2016.

Target Group:\nThese guidelines are directed at all healthcare providers - all medical practitioners,\nand allied health personnel. Target Population:\nThese guidelines are directed at individuals with stable CAD. Period of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with new\ndevelopments and knowledge. Implementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical\ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\u2022 Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on diagnosis\nand management of Stable CAD. This can be done by road shows, electronic\nmedia, and in-house training sessions. \u2022 Performance measures that include:\n\uf0d8 Percentage of patients with Stable CAD on optimal medical therapy with\naspirin (or clopidogrel or ticlid if aspirin intolerance) and statin therapy? Applicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThis guideline was developed taking into consideration our local health resources. Almost all the investigations and most of the medications recommended are\navailable in public hospitals or at the cardiac centres in Malaysia. Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nThis guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimize\nexisting resources in the diagnosis and management of stable CAD. Facilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barrier for the successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of\nknowledge of the public and healthcare providers on the:\n\u2022 role/limitations of the available non-invasive investigations in the diagnosis and\nrisk stratification of individuals with CAD. \u2022 benefits of optimal medical therapy in the management of persons with stable\nCAD. \u2022 role/limitations of PCI in the management of individuals with stable CAD-the\nfallacies of the \u201coculostenotic reflex\u201d. \u2022 \u201ccommercialization\u201d of the medical industry in promoting expensive and\nsometimes unnecessary investigations and PCIs.

Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n\u2022 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) covers a wide spectrum - from persons who are\nasymptomatic to those presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and\nsudden cardiac death (SCD). \u2022 Stable CAD includes individuals:\n\uf0d8 with stable chest pain or other symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea) which are known to\nbe due to CAD. \uf0d8 who had a previous episode of ACS but who are now stable. \uf0d8 post revascularization (by CABG or PCI). \uf0d8 who are asymptomatic but are known to have CAD on non-invasive testing. This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or Left Ventricular\n(LV) dysfunction. \u2022 Stable CAD may present as:\n\uf0d8 Chest pain\n\uf0d8 Dyspnea\n\uf0d8 Palpitations, near syncope and syncope. \u2022 In Stable CAD, angina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient\nand reversible imbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and\nsupply. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic component of the ruptured plaque\ndominates the overall pathophysiological process and clinical picture. In the DIAGNOSIS of CAD in patients presenting with stable chest symptoms\n(Fig 1, pg 23)\n\u2022 A detailed history and physical examination are of paramount importance. \u2022 Clinical investigations are necessary for:\n\uf0d8 detection of myocardial ischemia and/or\n\uf0d8 confirmation of the diagnosis and/or\n\uf0d8 prognostication. \u2022 Exercise stress ECG is the non-invasive test of choice in patients who can\nexercise and have interpretable ECGs. \u2022 Stress imaging tests are useful in individuals who have intermediate Pre-test\nprobability (PTP) of CAD (Table 1, pg 22) and who:\n\uf0d8 are unable to exercise adequately and/or\n\uf0d8 have uninterpretable resting ECG and/or\n\uf0d8 have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or which are abnormal at\nmoderate to high workloads.", "chunk_order": 8}

SUMMARY\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n\u2022 Computerised Tomographic Coronary Angiogram (CTA) - may be considered\nin individuals with low to intermediate risk PTP of CAD and who have mild or\nequivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress imaging tests\nand who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with good exercise capacity. \u2022 Invasive Coronary Angiogram (ICA) - This is not commonly used for the\ndiagnosis of CAD. It is important in risk stratification and in determining the optimal\nmode of revascularization. The RISK STRATIFICATION of patients with CAD who have stable symptoms of at\nleast 2 months duration involves:\n\u2022 Clinical evaluation\n\u2022 Resting ECG\n\u2022 Assessment of LV function by echocardiography\n\u2022 Non-invasive assessment for myocardial ischemia - (Table 2, pg 24)\n\u2022 Where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological assessment\nof the significance of the coronary lesion by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). Risk may be defined as:\n\u2022 high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n\u2022 intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n\u2022 low risk - annual mortality of <1%\nIn general, individuals with no ischemia demonstrated by non-invasive testing and/or\nhave no or minimal plaque in the coronary arteries by CTA have an excellent\nprognosis with a rate of cardiovascular (CV) death/non-fatal Myocardial\nInfarction(MI) of <0.5% and an annual mortality of <1%. \u2022 Low risk individuals can be managed with risk factor reduction and/or anti\nanginal medications as necessary. Revascularization has not been shown to\nimprove their long-term CV outcomes. Thus, no further intervention is required. This includes individuals who are:\n\uf0d8 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. \uf0d8 have no demonstrable or minimal ischemia on non-invasive testing. (Table 2,\npg 24)\n\u2022 Intermediate risk individuals may be managed with risk reduction strategies +/-\nanti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary angiogram and\nrevascularization depending on the clinical condition, ischemic burden and patient\npreferences. \u2022 High risk individuals, in addition to risk reduction strategies, should be considered\nfor invasive coronary angiography with view to revascularization.

(Table 2, pg 24)\nAll individuals with CAD who are at Intermediate and High Risk should be referred\nto tertiary cardiology centers for further evaluation and revascularization as indicated. Individuals at low risk can be managed both at the hospital and also in general\noutpatient clinics with Family Medicine Specialists. Following stabilization and revascularization, intermediate and high risk individuals\ncan be transferred back to the general outpatient clinics with Family Medicine\nSpecialists after a period of 1 - 2 years or at the discretion of the attending doctor. Management (Fig 2, pg 25) should be multifaceted and involves OMT which\nincludes both behavioural modification therapy and pharmacological therapy. \u2022 Behavioral modification therapy (BMT) - patient education and lifestyle modification. \u2022 Pharmacological therapy - This aims at:\n\uf0d8 Prevention of CV events. \uf077 All patients should receive aspirin and a statin (+/- non-statin therapy) with\nthe aim of achieving a LDL-C <1.8 mmol/l - the lower the better. \uf077 All CV risk factors should be treated to target. \uf077 Patients with depressed LV function (LVEF <40%) should receive ACEi/ARB,\n\u03b2-blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists as tolerated. Angiotensin-\nreceptor-neprilysin inhibitors may also be considered. \uf0d8 Relieving symptoms\n\uf077 \u03b2-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be prescribed\nas first-line treatment to reduce angina because they are widely available. \uf077 Ivabradine, trimetazidine, long-acting nitrates and ranolazine are recommended\nas add-on therapy in patients who remain symptomatic. \u2022 Myocardial revascularization - OMT should be instituted prior to revascularization\nprocedures. The decision to revascularize will depend on:\n\uf0d8 symptoms - presence of angina affecting quality of life. \uf0d8 extent of ischemia as determined by non-invasive testing\n\uf0d8 extent of coronary disease and where applicable physiological functional\ntesting using FFR. Individuals with:\n\uf077 FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularization as compared to OMT. \uf077 FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with revascularization\nand management should be based on clinical judgement. \uf077 FFR >0.8 - do not benefit from revascularization. \u2022 Wherever possible, a discussion with the patient and Heart Team should be\nencouraged prior to revascularization to determine the best strategy - PCI or CABG.

Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nA) Diagnosis of CAD in persons having stable chest pain/angina equivalent\nof more than 2 months\u2019 duration\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nRecommendation 1:\nIn making a diagnosis of CAD:\n\u2022 A detailed history and a thorough physical examination are important. \u2022 Relevant laboratory investigations to assess the general health status of the\nindividual and to look for co-morbidities. \u2022 A resting ECG, preferably during an episode of chest pain/angina equivalent. \u2022 An echocardiogram is not a routine investigation but is indicated in the:\n\uf0d8 Presence of abnormal auscultatory findings and/or\n\uf0d8 Presence of abnormal resting ECG and/or\n\uf0d8 Assessment of LV function/regional wall motion abnormalities in patients\nwith shortness of breath and/or known CAD. \u2022 A chest radiograph is not a routine investigation but may be helpful in assessing\ncardiac size, pulmonary vasculature and excluding certain non-cardiac causes\nof chest pain. Recommendation 2:\nIn persons with suspected CAD and undergoing non-invasive cardiac testing, it is\nimportant to determine the:\n\u2022 Pre-Test Probability (PTP) of CAD of that individual. (Table 1, pg 22). In the\nEuro model for assessing PTP, which this writing group has adopted,\n(Table 1, pg 22) patients with a:\n\uf0d8 low PTP of <15% can be assumed to have no significant obstructive CAD. In these individuals, CV risk factors should be treated to target. Other\ncauses of chest pain should be looked for. (Table 5, pg 35)\n\uf0d8 intermediate PTP (\u226515-\u2264 85%) require further non-invasive evaluation. \uf0d8 high PTP >85% can be assumed to have significant obstructive CAD and\nnvasive coronary angiography maybe a more appropriate investigation. \u2022 Sensitivity and specificity of the different diagnostic modalities.

INTRODUCTION\nCoronary Artery Disease (CAD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in\nMalaysia.10-12 It has been the main cause of death in both gender for over a decade\nalthough in recent years, the mortality trend has shown a small decrease.10-12 In most\nWestern countries however, mortality due to CAD has been on a significant\ndownward trend due to appropriate primary prevention strategies, improved\ndiagnosis and early treatment.13-15\nCAD covers a wide spectrum - from persons who are asymptomatic to those\npresenting with ACS and sudden cardiac death (SCD). This CPG on Stable CAD is directed at individuals:\n\u2022 with stable chest pain or other symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea) which are known or\nsuspected to be due to CAD. \u2022 who had a previous episode of ACS but who are now stable and need regular\nfollow up and monitoring. \u2022 post revascularization (by CABG or PCI) who are at present asymptomatic or\nhave stable symptoms due to CAD. \u2022 who are asymptomatic but are suspected or known to have CAD on non-invasive\ntesting. This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or Left\nVentricular (LV) dysfunction. It provides guidance on:\n\u2022 diagnosis of CAD in individuals presenting with stable chest symptoms. \u2022 risk stratification of individuals who are diagnosed with CAD.

CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD\nStable CAD may present as:\n\u2022 chest pain\n\u2022 dyspnoea\n\u2022 palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be\nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or\nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). Chest pain may be categorized into:\n\u2022 Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal\nchest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3\ncriteria:23\u201325 (Table 3, pg 29)\n1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back. 2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress. 3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \u2022 Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the\nabove 3 criteria. \u2022 Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical\nangina criteria.

Chest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n\u2022 coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an\nepicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or\n\u2022 microvascular dysfunction. Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nThese individuals are managed as stable CAD. Chest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n\u2022 of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n\u2022 occurring at rest and/or\n\u2022 associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea. Management of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial\nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction\n(UA/NSTEMI).26,27\nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under\nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and\n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25\nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults \u226520 years was 3.4% and was\nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the\nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29\nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15\nreport, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.30 In this\nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to\nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to\neither:\n\u2022 myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or\n\u2022 LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously\ninfarcted muscle (scar tissue). 2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia.

Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible\nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may\noccur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis\n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic\ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process\nand clinical picture. Myocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical\nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme\nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the\nelderly and in women. Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nMyocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:31\n\u2022 Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n\u2022 Non-obstructive CAD (\u226520% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of\nthese patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented. \u2022 Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\nThe commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related\nobstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of \u226550% in the left main\ncoronary artery and \u226570% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary\narteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees\nof coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. The pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD\nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include:\n\u2022 coronary vasospasm\n\u2022 microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence\nof microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of\nischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary\nmicrovascular dysfunction.37\n\u2022 myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be\nbetween 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common\n(0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is\nmost commonly involved.", "chunk_order": 18}

NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS OF STABLE CAD\nThe natural history of Stable CAD is marked by episodes of sudden deterioration\ndue to plaque fissuring, ulceration or erosion with superimposed thrombosis\nresulting in an acute decrease in myocardial oxygen supply and the clinical picture\nof ACS. The episodes of chest pain become more frequent, occurring at rest or with\nminimal exertion and with no obvious trigger. Accelerated chest pain may also occur\ndue to an episode of increased myocardial oxygen demand as in periods of emotional\nor strenuous physical stress/exertion. Earlier studies reported that the annual rate of MI in persons with stable angina was\n3.0-3.5%.42,43 Generally, the annual mortality has been estimated to be in the range\nof 1.2-2.4% per annum, cardiac death 0.6-1.4% per annum and non-fatal MI\n0.6-2.7%.44\nHowever, in a recent registry of patients with stable CAD managed in the contemporary\nera and who had their ischemic events and/or revascularization 4 to 5 years earlier,\nthe incidence of MI occurred linearly at a rate of 0.8% per year and about a third of\nthese were STEMI.21 About 20% of the MIs in this registry were due to very late stent\nthrombosis.21\nPrognosis in any individual patient however, will depend on the nature and extent of\nthe underlying disease, the LV function, the age of the patient, the presence of CV\nrisk factors and other co-morbidities.", "chunk_order": 19}

OTHER NON-INVASIVE INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CAD\n6.1 Principles of diagnostic testing\nAdditional non-invasive investigations help in the diagnosis of CAD and its\nprognostication. Important considerations are availability of resources, costs\nand the potential harm of any procedure including avoiding, wherever\npossible, false positive or false negative results. A false positive result can\nresult in unnecessary, expensive further downstream investigations and\nanxiety while a false negative result can result in a missed diagnosis and\nopportunity for appropriate treatment. In addition to a resting ECG, chest radiograph and echocardiogram, other\nnon-invasive tests may be:\n\u2022 Functional - for myocardial ischemia or\n\u2022 Anatomical - for visualization of the epicardial coronary arteries\nIn symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, functional testing as\ncompared to an initial strategy of anatomical testing with CTA did not result in\nan improvement in clinical outcomes.59 A meta-analysis found a small\ndecrease in the incidence of MI but no improvement in mortality or cardiac\ndeath at the cost of greater downstream invasive procedures.60 CTA, however,\nprovided better prognostic information than functional testing by identifying\npatients at risk due to non-obstructive CAD.61\nIn patients with known CAD presenting with atypical symptoms, a functional\ntest for myocardial ischemia is a more appropriate initial investigation. The interpretation of these diagnostic investigations will depend on:\n\u2022 the pre-test probability (PTP) i.e. the likelihood of CAD in that patient. The PTP can be estimated using different models based on the patient\u2019s\nage, sex and clinical history of chest pain.28,44,62\u201364\n\u2022 the diagnostic accuracy of the test which is represented by its sensitivity\nand specificity.", "chunk_order": 23}

(Table 6, pg 39) Sensitivity is the frequency of a true\npositive while specificity is the frequency of a true negative. In addition,\nthe positive predictive value is the frequency that a patient with a positive\ntest does have CAD and the negative predictive value is the frequency\nthat a patient with a negative test truly does not have CAD. The predictive\nvalue of a test is dependent on the prevalence of CAD in the population\nbeing studied. As the prevalence of CAD in the population decreases,\nthe positive predictive value declines and the negative predictive value\nincreases. I, C\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nDiagnostic testing is most valuable when the pre-test probability of CAD is intermediate. The precise definition of intermediate probability (i.e. between 15% and 85%) is\nsomewhat arbitrary.

In a study in low risk women who had good exercise capacity, both exercise ECG\nand stress MPI resulted in similar CV outcomes.65 An initial strategy of exercise ECG\nwas also more cost effective than an initial strategy of stress MPI.65,79\nStress echocardiogram, however, was found to be superior to exercise ECG as an\ninitial strategy for the prediction of CAD in individuals presenting with chest pain.80 It\nwas also found to be cost-beneficial.80\nThese imaging techniques have the advantage that they allow better localization of\nischemic areas especially in patients with prior MI, PCI or CABG. The diagnostic\nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one\nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n\u2022 the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image\nquality. \u2022 local resources and expertise. Prior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n\u2022 the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel. \u2022 each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast\nsensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to\nthe patient.

In the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging\ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic\naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.82\nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can\nsometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is\nbecause these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences\nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one\nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a \u201cnormal\u201d reference to be able to detect\ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are\nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel\nCAD, uniform tracer uptake due to \u201cbalanced\u201d ischemia may lead to a rather\nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.83-85\n6.2.2.1 Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or\npharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging\ntechniques. An exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological\nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if\nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor\nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with\ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments\nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the\nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening\nand inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and\nI, B\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nafter the stress.86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV\nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities\nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to\na functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic\nconsequences are poorly related.86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel\ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of\nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of\nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in\nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human\neye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion.", "chunk_order": 30}

With the usage of myocardial\ncontrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and\nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.94-96\n6.2.2.2. Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via\nSPECT\nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT\nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -\nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine. Ischemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared\nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV\nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD. SPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier\nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has\nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of\nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial\nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The\ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large\nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and\nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its\ncost.

They act\nby competitively inhibiting catecholamines from binding to \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b23 receptors,\nthus reducing heart rate, myocardial contractility and blood pressure. This results in\na decrease in myocardial oxygen demand.302 The prolongation of diastole also\nresults in improved coronary arterial filling.302 All these result in an improvement in\nsymptoms and exercise tolerance. \u03b2-blockers have not been shown to reduce the rate of CV events or mortality in\npatients with stable CAD. A meta-analysis of trials done in post MI patients in the\npre-primary PCI era, showed that \u03b2-blockers reduced all-cause mortality and\nnonfatal MI.303 Current data however, have not shown \u03b2-blockers to reduce long term\nmortality if continued beyond 1-year post MI.304,305\n\u03b2-blockers reduce all-cause mortality in individuals with reduced LV function, both\nischemic and non-ischemic heart failure.306 In these patients however, only\ncarvedilol, bisoprolol, long acting metoprolol and nebivolol have been shown to\nimprove prognosis and CV outcomes.307-314\nAll \u03b2-blockers appear to be equally effective in treating stable CAD. However,\nnebivolol has not been studied in patients with angina or who have had a recent MI. In diabetes, vasodilating \u03b2-blockers seem to have better metabolic profile since they\ncause less insulin resistance.315 Nebivolol, a \u03b21 selective blocker, has a favourable\nmetabolic profile, improves insulin sensitivity and does not cause deleterious effects\non lipid profile.316,317 Likewise, carvedilol, a non-selective \u03b2- and \u03b11-blocker,\nmaintains glycaemic control, while improving insulin sensitivity.318\nSide-effects of \u03b2-blockers include hypotension, fatigue, bradycardia, heart block,\nbronchospasm, peripheral vasoconstriction, impotence, hypoglycaemia and\ndepression. \u03b2-blockers are contraindicated in patients with known conduction\ndisorders, cardiogenic shock and should be used with caution in patients with\nasthma.319\n\u03b2-blockers can worsen symptoms in patients with vasospastic (Prinzmetal) angina\nand should therefore be avoided in these patients. Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n8.2.2.2. Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)\nCCBs dilate systemic arterioles and coronary arteries, resulting in reduced afterload\nand peripheral vascular resistance.320 Selective, non-competitive inhibition of\nvoltage-dependent L-type calcium channels lead to reduced myocardium contractility,\nsmooth muscle relaxation and nodal inhibition leading to a slowing down of\nconduction.320\nCCBs can be classified as:\n\u2022 dihydropyridines (DHPs) - amlodipine, felodipine, long-acting nifedipine. These\nhave greater binding affinity to the calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle\n\u2022 non-DHPs - verapamil and diltiazem.

In addition to their\nanti-anginal effects, they are also effective in controlling co-existing hypertension. The CCB-\u03b2-blocker combination is beneficial because the DHPs induced reflex\ntachycardia is blunted with the co-existing use of a \u03b2-blocker.25,321\nThe short-acting formulations of DHPs (short acting nifedipine) should be avoided in\npatients with CAD. Studies have shown that they increase the risk of MI while, at\nhigher doses, they increased mortality rates.322,323\nNon-DHPs such as verapamil and diltiazem are as efficacious as \u03b2-blockers as\nanti-anginal therapy and cause less symptoms of depression.25,324,325 However, the\nmultiple daily dosing of the immediate release formulations of the non-DHPs can\nresult in reduced adherence. Concurrent use of a non-DHP and a \u03b2-blocker, should\nbe used with caution because of the risk of bradycardia and heart block.326 They may\nalso be used cautiously in patients with LV dysfunction. CCBs are effective anti-anginal therapy but have not been shown to have any effect\non long term CV outcomes.327,328\n8.2.2.3. Nitrates\nNitrates are effective in the management of angina due to their coronary arteriolar\nand venous vasodilatation properties that result in a reduction in preload and\nafterload.329\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n8.2.2.3.1. Nitrates for acute angina\nSublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) can be given for immediate relief of angina. The\naerosol formulation has a faster onset of action. GTN improves exercise tolerance\nwhen given prophylactically, thus preventing anticipated angina caused by exertion. Besides its anti-anginal properties, GTN also has shown antithrombotic and\nantiplatelet activity.330,331\nGTN tablets should be kept in an amber coloured bottle and protected from sunlight. Once the bottle has been opened, the life-span is reduced to 8 weeks. The aerosol\nformulation can be used until the expiry date. 8.2.2.3.2.

This could offset the beneficial short-term\nischemic preconditioning effects and potentially worsen endothelial dysfunction.332,332\nTwice daily dosing of ISDN that provides a 10-12-hour nitrate-free interval each day\nis preferred.

Decreasing\nheart rate can lead to an improvement in angina by reducing myocardial oxygen\nconsumption and by increasing diastolic perfusion time.302\nIvabradine is a selective inhibitor of the sinus node If ion current (\u2018funny current\u2019). It\nis negatively chronotropic (slows heart rate), thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen\ndemand with no effect on myocardial contractility or systemic blood pressure.338,339\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n78\nIvabradine has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce CV hospitalization,\nfatal and non-fatal MI and the need for coronary revascularization in patients with\nstable CAD, moderate LV dysfunction and HR >70 bpm.340-344\nIvabradine may be considered for symptomatic treatment of stable CAD in patients\nwith normal sinus rhythm, especially in those who have a contraindication to or\nintolerance to \u03b2-blockers. It may also be used in combination with \u03b2-blockers in\npatients with high resting heart rates.344-347 The dose should be decreased or\ndiscontinued if HR remains below 50bpm. Ivabradine is not suitable for patients who are in atrial fibrillation. Its use with\nrate-limiting non-DHPs should be avoided because of the QT prolonging effect.348\nSide-effects include bradycardia and reversible visual disturbances.338 There is no\nsignificant interaction with most other cardiac drugs e.g. ACEis, ARBs, warfarin,\namiodarone, anti-platelet agents, cholesterol lowing agents, digoxin and diuretics. 8.2.2.5. Trimetazidine (3-Ketoacyl CoA thiolase [KAT] inhibitor)\nTrimetazidine inhibits 3-KAT (3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase) enzyme in myocardial\ncells-resulting in a switch of the energy substrate from fatty acid to glucose oxidation. This is a more efficient pathway for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. In small clinical studies, trimetazidine has been shown to be effective in providing\nangina symptom relief, reduction in the need for nitrates, time to onset of ST depression\nand improving functional capacity.349-353 It is useful as monotherapy and in combination\nwith other anti-ischaemic agents.349-353 Trimetazidine has not been evaluated in large\noutcome studies in patients with stable CAD. In patients with erectile dysfunction and using PDE5 inhibitor, the concomitant use\nof trimetazidine is safe.354 Trimetazidine should be used with caution in the presence\nof CKD.355 There have been reports of association between trimetazidine and\nsymptoms of parkinsonism.356\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n79\n8.2.2.6.

CHRONIC REFRACTORY ANGINA\nChronic refractory angina is a clinical diagnosis based on the symptoms of ischaemic\nchest pain of >3 months duration which is not controlled by a combination of maximal\nmedical therapy and/or revascularization.

SPECIAL GROUPS\n10.1 Diabetes\nDiabetes is associated with an increased risk of CVD. CAD mortality is\nincreased by 3-fold in diabetic men and 2-5 fold in diabetic women.426-429\nDiabetics have a higher prevalence of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia.430\nSymptoms occur at an earlier age. Diabetics may also have subclinical\nventricular dysfunction which may reduce their exercise capacity.431\nIn patients with diabetes, the poorer the glycaemic control the greater the\nincidence of CVD.432,433 Diabetics tend to have extensive CAD with high rates\nof multi-vessel disease and restenosis, post-PCI. This is due to the chronic\nmetabolic disturbances.434,435\nConventional\ntherapies\nfor\nCAD\nand\nindications\nfor\ncoronary\nrevascularisation are similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.436\nIIb, B\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n86\nDM management should include:\n\u2022 Lifestyle and pharmacotherapy (OMT) measures to achieve a near-normal\nHbA1c437\n\u2022 Long-term maintenance of near-normal blood glucose levels substantially\nreduces complications and mortality.438-441 However, this should be\nindividualized based on the patient\u2019s age and comorbidities. \u2022 In the pharmacotherapy of diabetic patients with CAD:\n\uf0d8 both the SGLT2i and the GLP-1 agonists have been shown to be\nassociated with a reduction in the risk of CV composite end-points.442-445\n\uf0d8 the SGLT2i have been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure.442\n\uf0d8 In a meta-analysis, the SGLT2i and GLP-1 agonists have been\nassociated with a reduction in all cause mortality.446\n\uf0d8 thiazolidinediones are associated with an increase in the incidence of\nheart failure and should be avoided in those in NYHA Functional class\n3 & 4.447,448\n\uf0d8 Saxagliptin, a DPP-4i, was also shown to be associated with an\nincrease in hospitalization for heart failure.449 However this is not seen\nwith the other agents of the same class.450\nIn general, in diabetic patients with multivessel disease, CABG is the\npreferred revascularization strategy.153,381\n10.2.

Women often have atypical presentations.456 In addition to chest pain\nor discomfort, women also have a lot of non-chest related pain symptoms. Compared to men, women\u2019s symptoms are more often precipitated by mental or\nemotional stress and less frequently by exertion. 456\nFollowing an MI, women have worse outcomes irrespective of age.457,458 More\nwomen had sudden cardiac death (SCD) before their arrival in hospital and almost\ntwo thirds of women who died suddenly, had no previous symptoms.459,460\nNon-obstructive CAD is more common in women.461,462 Patients with non-obstructive\nCAD may present as stable angina, ACS and sudden death.461 The prognosis of this\ncondition is not benign.

Diagnosis of CAD in women\nThe diagnosis of angina in women is more difficult for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Atypical chest pain and angina-equivalent symptoms such as dyspnoea are\nmore common in women. \u2022 Correlation between symptoms and 'significant' luminal obstruction at coronary\nangiography is weaker in women. \u2022 Angina with demonstrable myocardial ischaemia may be present in the presence\nof normal coronaries or minor atherosclerotic disease. In the non-invasive evaluation of women with chest pain, exercise stress ECG is the\nfirst test of choice in women with good exercise capacity and a normal resting ECG. Exercise stress ECG have higher false positive rates in women than in men. The\nsensitivity is 31-71% and specificity is about 66 to 78% in women and about 80% for\nboth in men.66,472,473\nDespite these limitations, a normal exercise stress ECG at adequate workloads in\nwomen with intermediate probability of CAD is a good indication that there is no\nsignificant obstructive lesion.66,471 An exercise ECG stress test, however, does not\ndetect myocardial ischemia in women with non-obstructive coronary lesions. Due to the limitations of exercise ECG stress testing, stress echocardiography\n(exercise or dobutamine) and stress SPECT have been recommended in women. Both these tests can detect myocardial ischemia in the presence of obstructive and\nnon-obstructive coronary lesions.66 These tests also have higher specificity.473 The\ndiagnostic accuracy of SPECT however, can be reduced in women by both breast\ntissue and obesity, especially in the anterior myocardial segments, resulting in\nfalse-positives. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a newer imaging tool to investigate CAD in\nwomen. A negative stress CMR study is associated with very low risk of CV death\nand MI.474\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n89\n10.2.2.

This may be further\ncompounded when some of the elderly have difficulties expressing their symptoms\ndue to dysphasia or cognition issues. Comorbidities that can mimic stable CAD are\ncommon (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal pain).

Exercise stress testing is often\ndifficult due to muscle weakness and deconditioning and osteoarthritis of the knees. Less challenging exercise stress protocols or pharmacological stress imaging such\nas DSE may be appropriate.476\nThe specificity of test results is often reduced because of a higher rate of false\npositive results due to abnormal resting ECG and a higher prevalence of\nconfounders including prior Ml, conduction disturbances, hypertension and left\nventricular hypertrophy. At the same time a negative test may be a false negative in\na population with high prevalence of disease. Arrhythmias are also more common at\nhigher exercise workloads.477\nCTA may not be suitable in the elderly because of the presence of coronary\ncalcification making visualization of the lumen difficult. Elderly patients with objective evidence of moderate to severe ischemia on\nnon-invasive testing or with troubling angina despite OMT, should have similar\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\naccess to ICA as younger patients.

Management\nElderly patients have the same benefit from OMT and coronary revascularization as\nyounger patients.482-487 Management should be individualised taking into\nconsideration comorbidities and should not be based on age alone. Important considerations in drug therapy in the elderly are dose modification, drug\ninteractions, polypharmacy and compliance.488,489\nMeta-analysis have shown that patients >65 years of age with multivessel disease\nhad better outcomes when they underwent CABG compared with PCI, while younger\npatients tended to have more favourable outcomes with PCI.490-492 An all comers\nregistry demonstrated that patients in the age group \u226574 years and triple vessel CAD\nhad significantly higher all-cause mortality when they underwent PCI as compared\nto CABG (even after adjustment of confounders).493 PCI was also associated with a\nsignificantly higher risk for cardiac death, MI, heart failure hospitalization, and new\ncoronary interventions, but with a similar risk for sudden death, and significantly\nlower risk for stroke.493\nFrailty is an important confounding factor when one looks at CV outcomes following\nPCI.

It is being increasingly recognized that mineralocorticoid\nexcess, mineral and bone metabolism abnormalities play a role in the pathogenesis\nof CAD and its complications in CKD patients.503-505\n10.4.1. Diagnostic testing in CKD\nThe increased prevalence of CAD among CKD patients reduces the negative predictive\nvalue of diagnostic studies. Exercise ECG stress testing is limited by an abnormal baseline resting ECG, lack of\nspecificity of the ST-segment response and by the inability of many CKD patients to\nexercise to a diagnostic workload.506,507\nStress echocardiography may be compromised by small LV cavity size in patients\nwith elevated LV mass index.508,509 Sensitivity and specificity for pharmacological\nstress echocardiography in CKD patients is 69-95% and 76-94%, respectively.510,511\nNephrotoxicity of contrast agents limit the use of CMR and CTA. Further, the high\nprevalence of coronary calcification makes interpretation of CTA very difficult. MPI is more sensitive but less specific than stress echocardiography. The accuracy\nof exercise and of pharmacological MPI is reduced in CKD patients, and the\nsensitivities and specificities are <80%.512\n10.4.2.

There is a paucity of data regarding revascularization in CKD patients with stable\nCAD. There have been no randomized clinical trials comparing coronary\nrevascularization strategies in advanced CKD patients. A subgroup analysis of the\nCOURAGE trial did not find a benefit from PCI compared with OMT in ~320 patients\nwith CKD Stage III-IV who had predominantly low-risk, multivessel disease.521 The\nARTS-1 trial found no significant difference in the primary end point (death, MI,\nstroke) between PCI and CABG surgery in 290 patients with creatinine clearance\n<60 ml/min.522\nObservational data consistently show increased risk of serious operative\ncomplications in CKD patients.523-525 Incidence of operative death after CABG is\n9-12.2% for CKD stage V, and 3- to 7-fold higher in CKD stage IV-V than in\nnon-CKD.523,524 PCI may be an alternative but may pose the added risk of\ncontrast-induced nephropathy. In a study of CKD stage V patients undergoing first\nrevascularization, in-hospital mortality was lower with PCI (4.1 vs 8.6%), but 2-year\nsurvival was better with CABG (56.4 vs 48.4%).525\nThe ISCHEMIA-CKD (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With\nMedical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease) trial is a randomized\nongoing trial with a target of 1,000 patients with eGFRs <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (or on\ndialysis therapy) and moderate ischemia to determine whether a routine invasive\nstrategy (cardiac catheterization and then revascularization together with OMT) is\nsuperior to a conservative strategy (OMT; catheterization and revascularization\navailable as indicated). 526\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n93\nKey Messages:\n\u2022 Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of CVD. \uf0d8 Conventional therapies for CAD and indications for coronary revascularisation\nare similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. \uf0d8 Long-term maintenance of near-normal blood glucose levels substantially\nreduces complications and mortality.", "chunk_order": 63}
