The CPG was adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines only as it\nis mostly well-accepted guidelines, namely:\nGuidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, emergency\nupdate 2008\nGuidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2011\nupdate\nDefinitions and reporting framework for tuberculosis, - 2013 revision\nCompanion handbook to the WHO guidelines for the programmatic management of\ndrug-resistant tuberculosis (2014)\nWHO treatment guidelines for drug-resistant tuberculosis- 2016 update\nThe adaptation process followed the Manual on Adaptation of Evidence Based Clinical Practice\nGuidelines of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (which was adapted from ADAPTE Resource\nToolkit for Guideline Adaptation). Assessment of the WHO Guidelines showed that the quality\n[using Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool], currency, content,\nconsistency and applicability of the documents justified them to be adapted for local use. The CPG DG had decided that no literature search was required in the adaptation process\nbecause the evidence use is sufficient enough for management of DR-TB cases in the country. All statements and recommendations were modified and formulated (when necessary) with local\npractices taken into consideration. They were agreed upon by both the DG and RC. On completion, the draft CPG was sent for review by WHO (author of the CPGs that being\nadapted) and external reviewers. It was also posted on the MOH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory\nCommittee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MOH Malaysia for final review and\napproval.

However, this disease is now back with a vengeance and drug resistant forms are\nincreasing to almost an epidemic proportion in certain parts of the world. The burden of\nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing both globally and locally. WHO\nestimated about 480,000 people develop MDR-TB worldwide in 20131. The number of\npeople diagnosed with MDR-TB tripled between 2009 and 2013, and reached 136,000\nworldwide. In Malaysia, there were 101 cases of MDR-TB reported in 2015 (refer to Fig. 1)2. The globalisation of the recent century has made the spread of diseases more rapid\nwith massive migrations. Fig. 1: Cases of MDR-TB, Malaysia (2004-2015)\nThough MDR-TB has multifactorial causes, the main reason for the emergence of this scourge\nis improper treatment. This may be caused by non-compliance, poor treatment regimes, poor\nquality of drugs or concomitant medical diseases. Besides the toll on the health of individuals\nsuffering from MDR-TB, the cost is also devastating economically.", "chunk_order": 5}

This may be caused by non-compliance, poor treatment regimes, poor\nquality of drugs or concomitant medical diseases. Besides the toll on the health of individuals\nsuffering from MDR-TB, the cost is also devastating economically. Estimated direct cost of the\ndrug to treat one MDR-TB patient is RM 15,000.00 compared to RM250.00 for treatment of one\ndrug susceptible TB patient. Currently, it is not just MDR-TB but extensively drug-resistant TB\n(XDR-TB) has emerged to further complicate the management of drug-resistant TB. We are currently in urgent need to have guidelines locally to help guide and standardise\nmanagement of DR-TB which include diagnosis, treatment, prevention and surveillance among\nhealthcare providers in Malaysia. It was decided to adapt the World Health Organization (WHO)\nguidelines on the Programmatic Management of DR-TB which involves documents published in\n2008, 2011, 2013, 2014 and the latest 2016 update in the development of the guidelines. The\n2016 update introduces the concept of shorter MDR-TB treatment regime between 9-12 months\nfor newly diagnosed patients. Besides improving compliance, it would also significantly reduce\nthe cost of treating MDR-TB (refer appendix 2). These guidelines, the first in the country for the\nmanagement of DR-TB, definitely are helpful to the healthcare providers in managing the\nmedical condition more effectively and successfully. 13\n17\n42\n41\n56\n55\n64\n141\n74\n124\n104\n101\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nMDR Case\nYear\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n2\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n2\n2. PREVENTION OF DRUG-RESISTANT TB\nThe best way to treat MDR-TB is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Doctors need to\nbe familiar with causes of DR-TB and the two different pathways leading to formation of DR-TB,\nonly then we can come up with interventions to interrupt this causation. 2.1 Causes of drug-resistant TB\n2.1.1 Two pathways leading to drug-resistant TB\nDrug-resistant TB has two developmental pathways that are interconnected with multiple factors\n(refer to Fig. 2). Note: Pathways to development of drug-resistant TB. Arrows represent progression along the two\npathways. Numbers represent factors that can contribute to the prevention of progression. Fig. 2: Two pathways leading to drug-resistant TB\na.

FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF DR-TB\nThe Tuberculosis Control Programme consists of five essential components of a framework that\nembodied the whole management aspect of TB. It is tailored according to local situation and\nintegrated into Direct Observe Treatment Short-course (DOTS) based National Tuberculosis\nProgramme (NTP). 3.1 DOTS framework as applied to the management of DR-TB\nThe DOTS strategy is applicable to the whole TB control including DR-TB, as the principles are\nthe same. 3.1.1 Sustained political commitment\nPolitical commitment is important in fostering national and international partnerships which\nshould be linked to long-term strategic action plans prepared by NTPs. Long term investment\nand leadership run parallel in order to ensure an appropriate integration of DR-TB management\ninto NTP. Appropriate integration refers to:\n\u2022 securing adequate infrastructure,\n\u2022 development and retention of human resources,\n\u2022 interagency cooperation,\n\u2022 enactment of necessary legislation,\n\u2022 TB control policies enabling implementation of the programme\n\u2022\nfacilitation of the procurement of quality-assured second-line drugs and equipment for\ndiagnostic purposes\nEffective TB control strategy and implementation can only takes place with a clear and\nsustained political commitment. 3.1.2 Rational case-finding strategy; accentuating on the importance of timely diagnosis\nthrough quality-assured culture, molecular testings and Drug Susceptibility Test\n(DST)\nTB control largely depends on timely and correct diagnosis. Quality assurance and proficiency\ntesting with a recognised reference laboratory such as one of the WHO-recognized National\nReference Laboratory must be in place. Ideally, one culture/ DST centre is in place for every five\nmillion populations (1: 5,000,000). Unreliable laboratory results due to non-viable cultures,\ncontamination, clerical or administrative error will give impact to NTP. Recommendation 1\n\u2022\nAll tuberculosis patients should have universal access to diagnostic test specifically\nCulture and Drug Susceptibility Test. 3.1.3 Case management (case holding) by appropriate treatment strategies with secondline drugs\nAn excellent DR-TB treatment centre delivers an optimal treatment regimen, in a patientcentered approach concept which includes DOT and monitoring of drug adverse reactions. To\nhave this in place requires dedicated and committed expertise to consider several factors:\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n5\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n5\n\u2022\nImplementation of an appropriate substantial infection control\n\u2022\nA well-defined drug resistance surveillance (DRS) data\n\u2022\nProper patient\u2019s documentation including TB drug history\n\u2022\nStructured procurement of second-line drug and flow of drug monitoring to end user\n\u2022\nAvailability of DST to first- and selected second-line drugs\n\u2022\nReliable options for delivering DOT consistently\n\u2022\nAddressing patients co-infected with HIV and diabetes\nStandardized regimen for specific group of patients should be decided by DR-TB experts.

Ambulatory would be best if there is\nexisting social support network available to facilitate adherence at the same time trained\npersonnel to supervise DOT and identify adverse drug reactions. 3.1.4 Uninterrupted supply of quality-assured anti-TB drugs\nIn management of MDR/XDR-TB, treatment regimens are frequently changed due to drug\nadverse reaction, delayed DST result with poor response to treatment. This creates more\ncomplexity in second-line drugs management on top of its existing short shelf-life, limited global\nproduction and its high price. In order to ensure uninterrupted supply of second-line drug, the\nprocess of procurement must begin at least 6 months or more prior to anticipated need and it\nmust be estimated accordingly to avoid wastage. It is important to ensure quality assured drug\nis used, recognized by WHO or that meet WHO GMP standards. 3.1.5 Standardised recording and reporting system\nA complete recording system need to be specifically structured under the DR-TB control\nprogram. This is because it differs by categories and in cooperate a wide array of laboratory\nresults consisting of culture and DST for first-line and second-line drugs. Its case monitoring is\nlengthy; with treatment delivery and response that can reach 24 months. Its cohort analysis\nincludes interim indicators and the treatment outcome is only reached after two years or more. The registry and recording must follow the latest case definition by the WHO entitled Definitions\nand Reporting Framework for tuberculosis \u2013 2013 revision with National adaptation is required. A good, specific recording; design for MDR/XDR-TB is essential for evaluating program\nperformance and treatment effectiveness. 3.2 A plan for tailored integration of management of DR-TB into national programme\nIt is challenging to implement an integrated DR-TB management into the NTP. The integration\nneeds full commitment from top down and bottom up in order to secure a sound, apprehensible\nand holistic approach covering advocacy, detection, treatment and patient\u2019s welfare.

For the purposes of monitoring, drug-resistant cases are classified in categories based on DST\nin clinical isolates confirmed to be M. Tuberculosis (note, the categories are NOT mutually\nexclusive):\n\u2022\nMono-resistance: resistance to one first-line anti-TB drug only. \u2022\nPoly-resistance: resistance to more than one first-line anti-TB drug, other than both\nisoniazid and rifampicin. \u2022\nMultidrug resistance (MDR): resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampicin. \u2022\nExtensive drug resistance (XDR): resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and at least one of\nthree second-line injectable drugs (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin), in addition to\nmultidrug resistance. \u2022\nRifampicin resistance (RR): resistance to rifampicin detected using phenotypic or\ngenotypic methods, with or without resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It includes any\nresistance to rifampicin, in the form of mono-resistance, poly-resistance, MDR or XDR. Patients placed on second-line anti-TB medications usually belong to one of the following\ngroups:\n\u2022\nConfirmed RR-TB or MDR-TB. \u2022\nPresumptive RR-TB or MDR-TB. Patients may be registered and started on second-line\nanti-TB treatment on the basis of significant risk for drug resistance and before laboratory\nconfirmation of resistance, or on the basis of a rapid molecular result. \u2022\nPoly-/mono-resistant TB without rifampicin resistance.

To strengthen and support the national reference laboratory, Queensland\nMycobacterium Reference Laboratory has been recognised as the SRL for Malaysia. 6.3 Specimen collection and transport of infectious substances\nGood quality specimens especially sputum are essential for proper TB laboratory diagnosis. Therefore, specific measures must be taken to minimise exposure during sputum collection as\ncoughing produces potentially infectious aerosols. Patient must also be given effective instructions from a trained staff on collecting samples. Adequate material such as using wide-mouthed containers that are sterile, clear and leak-proof\n(with screw caps) and procedures must also be available. The specimen containers should be\npromptly transported to the laboratory using appropriate packaging for safe transport of\ninfectious materials. Specimen containers should be promptly transported to the laboratory using appropriate\npackaging for safe transport of infectious materials, surrounded by absorbent material,\nprotected by a secondary packaging and then placed in a shock-resistant outer packaging\nlabelled according to national and international regulations for the transport of infectious\nmaterials. Recommendation 2\n\u2022\nSpecimens should be collected in open air, well-ventilated areas, where infectious\ndroplets are rapidly diluted and ultra violet rays can inactivate tuberculosis bacilli to\nreduce risk of transmission. \u2022\nSpecimens should be submitted to the laboratory and processed for culture within 24\nhours from collection. Delayed specimens should be kept refrigerated at 4\u00b0C and\ntransported to the laboratory in cold chain. \u2022\nSpecimen containers should be transported to the laboratory using appropriate\npackaging for safe transport of infectious materials. 6.4 Mycobacteriology laboratory services for drug-resistant TB programmes\n6.4.1 Microscopy\nSmear microscopy is the front-line tool for TB (but not for DR-TB) diagnosis. The main purposes\nof microscopy for drug-resistant TB are:\n\u2022\nto assess initial bacterial load, specimen triage to different diagnostic algorithms,\n\u2022\nmonitor response to therapy,\n\u2022\nin the TB culture centres: to confirm the presence of AFB rather than contaminants in the\nculture media, before proceeding to rapid identification tests.

Figure 3 shows\nusing the Xpert MTB/RIF assay as the initial diagnostic test for TB followed by culture and DST. Indication of using Xpert MTB/RIF as initial diagnostic test is listed in Appendix 3. Recommendation 3\n\u2022\nXpert MTB/RIF should be used in addition to conventional microscopy, culture and DST\nas the initial diagnostic test in adults and children suspected of having MDR-TB or HIVassociated TB. It may be used as a follow-on test to microscopy in adults and children\nclinically suspicious of TB where MDR-TB and HIV is of lesser concern, especially in\nfurther testing of smear-negative specimens where resources are available. Xpert MTB/RIF assay cannot be used as a replacement for smear and culture isolation for\nmonitoring the response of DR-TB patients to therapy\n6.4.3 Line probe assay\nLine probe assay (LPA) allows rapid detection of resistance to rifampicin (alone or in\ncombination with isoniazid). LPAs are suitable for use at the central or national reference\nlaboratory level, with potential for decentralization to regional level if the appropriate\ninfrastructure can be ensured. For patients with confirmed rifampicin-resistant TB or MDR-TB, SL-LPA may be used as the\ninitial test to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs. This\nrecommendation applies to the use of SL-LPA for testing sputum specimens (direct testing) and\ncultured isolates of M. tuberculosis complex (indirect testing) from both pulmonary and\nextrapulmonary sites. 6.4.4 Culture of MTB\nCulture in liquid media is the current reference method for bacteriological confirmation of TB. However, good quality specimens, prompt transport to the laboratory and quality of laboratory\nprocessing (appropriate digestion and decontamination, as well as good quality culture media\nand incubation conditions) are critical to optimize the yield of culture. Laboratory errors, may\nlead to false-negative or false-positive results. Therefore, laboratory findings should always be\ncorrelated with the patient\u2019s clinical condition and any diagnostic test should be repeated if\nnecessary. The recovery of tubercle bacilli is higher and the time to detection is shorter with liquid\nculture compared to solid culture methods. However, as it is more sensitive, it has higher\ncontamination rates than solid media.

It allows the detection of drug resistance regardless of the\nmechanism or molecular basis and can be performed as direct or indirect tests on solid media\nor in liquid media. The most commonly used methods for solid media are the proportion,\nabsolute concentration, and resistance ratio methods; and for liquid culture systems is the\nproportion method. For second-line DST, broth or liquid methods and the proportion method on solid medium give\nsimilar results5. The absolute concentration and resistance ratio methods for second-line DST\nhave not been validated, and neither have any of the non-commercial methods. The current\nstatus of DST methods, consensus on reliability and reproducibility, and critical concentrations\nfor different methods for second-line DST is given in Table 5.

TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR MDR-TB AND XDR-TB\nIt is critical for a country to know the prevalence of drug resistance in new patients and\nretreatment cases. As for Malaysia, estimated RR/MDR-TB cases among notified TB pulmonary\ncases in Malaysia for new cases was 1.5% and previously treated cases was 3.1% for year\n2015. Therefore, access to quality assured DST is valuable and important. Mechanism for\ncollection of the data and statistic, notification, registration and updating the patient monitoring\nand response in the TB information system is very important. Drug resistance surveillance(DRS) data can also be used as a tool to monitor the frequency of\nusage of each second-line anti-TB as some second-line anti-TB drugs may have been used\nmore frequently than the others. Some will likely be effective in drug-resistant TB treatment\nregimens, while others may have been used extensively, and therefore, have a high probability\nof ineffectiveness in a large proportion of drug-resistant TB patients. 7.1 Definitions of terms used to describe treatment strategies\nThe following are definitions of terms often used to describe treatment strategies (refer to table\n7);\nTable 7: Definition of treatment strategies\nTreatment Strategies\nDefinition\nStandardized\ntreatment\nDRS data from representative patient populations are used to\nbase regimen design in the absence of individual DST.

Each anti-TB drug has an\nabbreviation (refer to Table8). A drug-resistant TB regimen consists of two phases:\na) First/intensive phase is the period in which the injectable agent is used\nb) Second/maintenance phase is after the injectable agent has been stopped. How to write the regime:\n\u2022\nThe two phases are generally separated by a backslash (/). \u2022\nThe number before each phase stands for phase duration in months, and this number is the\nminimum amount of time that the stage should last. \u2022\nThe number in subscript (e.g. 3) after a letter is the number of drug doses per week. If there\nis no number in subscript, treatment is daily (injectables are generally given for 5\u20136 days per\nweek). \u2022\nThe drugs in the higher groups are written first followed by others in descending group\norder.

It applies\nto standardised and individualised regimens. 7.5.1 General principles\nThe following are the basic principles involved in the treatment of MDR-TB;\na. usage of \u201clikely effective\u201d drugs. Anti-TB drug is considered \u201clikely to be effective\u201d when;\n\u2022\nthe drug has not been used in a regimen that failed to cure the individual patient;\n\u2022\nDST performed on the patient\u2019s strain indicates that it is susceptible to the drug\n\u2022\nNo known resistance to drugs with high cross-resistance\n\u2022\nNo known close contacts with resistance to the drug\n\u2022\nDrug resistance surveys demonstrate that resistance is rare to the drug in patients with\nsimilar TB history. \u2022\nIn the treatment of patients with MDR-TB, ethionamide (or prothionamide) should be\nused provided no contraindication such as a severe adverse effects. \u2022\nMore than five drugs can be used depending on the effectiveness of the drugs for\nexample in XDR-TB. b. dosage and frequency of the drugs\n\u2022\nThe drug dosage is usually determined by age and weight. \u2022\nAll anti-TB drugs can be started at full dose. However, if tolerance is an issue,\ncycloserine, ethionamide and PAS dosing can be increased gradually over a two-week\nperiod. \u2022\nPyrazinamide, ethambutol and fluoroquinolones should be given once a day. \u2022\nEthionamide/prothionamide, cycloserine and PAS have traditionally been given in split\ndoses during the day to reduce adverse effects.

If adverse effects\noccur, injectable agent may be given three times a week, preferably only after culture\nconversion. \u2022\nOral drugs are to be given seven days a week under DOT. \u2022\nPyrazinamide can be used for the entire treatment since many drug-resistant TB\npatients have chronically inflammed lungs as Pyrazinamide is more effective in the\nacidic environment. In Rifampicin Resistant patients, high-dose isoniazid may be\nincluded in the MDR regimen until DST to isoniazid is available. c. addressing the Adverse effect\n\u2022\nTo avoid the drugs that is known to have a strong contraindication of usage due to\ndrug\u2013drug interactions, overlying toxicities, co-morbidities, history of severe allergy or\nother adverse reactions and pregnancy. \u2022\nAny adverse effects of drugs that occurs should be managed immediately and\nadequately to relief suffering, minimize the risk of treatment interruptions, and prevent\nmorbidity and mortality due to serious adverse effects. d. TB-HIV co-morbidity\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients with HIV and drug-resistant TB,\nirrespective of CD4 cell-count, as early as possible following initiation of the anti-TB\ntreatment. 7.5.2 Suggestion for conventional DR-TB regimen\nTable 9 shows suggestion for conventional DR-TB regimen.

Recommendation 5\n\u2022\nIn the conventional treatment of patients with MDR-TB, an INTENSIVE PHASE of eight\nmonths is suggested for most patients, and the duration may be modified according to\nthe patient\u2019s response to therapy. \u2022\nIn the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with MDR-TB, TOTAL TREATMENT\nduration of 20 months is suggested for most patients, and the duration may be modified\naccording to the patient\u2019s response to therapy. \u2022\nShorter MDR-TB regimen duration is 9-12months. 7.7 Extrapulmonary and central nervous system drug-resistant TB\nThe same strategy and duration to pulmonary drug resistant tuberculosis are applied to\nextrapulmonary drug resistant tuberculosis.

Pyrazinamide has good CNS penetration, although caution should be exercised as a large\npercentage of MDR-TB strains may be resistant. Isoniazid penetrates the CNS very well, with\nhigher doses reaching adequate MICs in the cerebrospinal fluid. Due to its good CNS\npenetration, high-dose isoniazid is recommended to be used as part of the treatment regimen\nunless high-level resistance is known to exist. No recommendation is possible at this stage to use the shorter regimen in patients with\nextrapulmonary MDR-TB in view of the findings from studies of shorter MDR-TB regimen\nwere limited to patients with pulmonary disease. 7.8 Surgery in treatment of DR-TB\nSurgery in DR-TB is an adjunct to the medical treatment. Resection is done to those patients\nwith disease localized to a lobe or lung. Large case series analysis has proven resection\nsurgery to be effective and safe under appropriate surgical conditions. It is considered an\nadjunct to chemotherapy and appears to be beneficial for patients when skilled thoracic\nsurgeons and excellent postoperative care are available.

Nevertheless, even with successful resection, the intensive phase and total treatment duration\nshould be guided by the recommendations in Sections 7.8.

Recommendation 6\n\u2022 In patients with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB, elective partial lung\nresection (lobectomy or wedge resection) may be used alongside a recommended MDRTB regimen (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). 7.9 Corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy in drug-resistant TB treatment\nThe role of adjuvant therapies has not been well established except in specific indications. It\nshould be given in tapering dose over several weeks. Corticosteroids can be beneficial in conditions like severe central nervous system or\npericardial involvement. 7.10 Nutritional support\nNutritional support is one of the important factors in the management of DR-TB as TB itself\ncauses malnutrition and DR-TB exacerbates by poor nutritional status. Furthermore, the\nsecond-line anti-TB can also cause GI disturbance and decrease the appetite making adequate\nnutrition a challenge. Therefore, nutritional assessment counselling should be integrated in the\nmultidisciplinary team throughout the duration of illness. Peripheral neuropathy is a known\nneurological side effect of some of second-line anti-TB drugs. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) should be given to all MDR-TB patients receiving cycloserine or\nterizidone, and a high dosage of isoniazid or linezolid to prevent neurological side effects\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n32\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n32\n7.11 Treatment strategies of XDR-TB\nThere is very limited data on XDR-TB management. However, there are recent studies and\nmeta-analysis suggested:\nSuccess in XDR-TB patients was highest if at least six drugs were used in the intensive\nphase and four in the continuation phase. The use of later-generation fluoroquinolone significantly improved treatment outcomes in\npatients with XDR-TB, even though DST demonstrated resistance to a representative\nfluoroquinolone. Treatment management for patients with documented or almost certain XDR-TB are as below\n(refer Table 11);\nTable 11: Treatment management for patients with documented or almost certain XDR-TB\nStep 1\nUse a higher-generation fluoroquinolone Group A such as moxifloxacin or\ngatifloxacin. Step 2\nUse an injectable agent Group B to which the strain is susceptible and consider\nan extended duration of use (12 months or possibly the whole treatment). If\nresistant to all injectable agents it is recommended to use one the patient has\nnever used before or consider designing the regimen without an injectable\nagent. Step 3\nUse all Group C agents that have not been used extensively in a previous\nregimen or any that are likely to be effective\nStep 4\nUse pyrazinamide and any other Group D1 agent that may be effective.", "chunk_order": 29}

MONO-RESISTANT AND POLY- RESISTANT STRAINS\nMono- and poly-resistant TB strains are picked up during case-finding for MDR-TB. DST should\nbe done in all patients before treatment using a rapid test that detects resistance to isoniazid\nand rifampicin. It is important to address this situation as treating patients who have mono- or poly-resistant\nstrains using the standardised first-line anti-TB drug regimens has been shown to increase the\nrisk of treatment failure and further acquired resistance. This may eventually lead to MDR-TB if\nit is not properly managed. 8.1 Treatment of patients with mono- and poly-resistant strains\nTable 12 shows the various regimens for mono- and poly-resistant strains. There is a lack of\nrandomized clinical trials to determine the best treatment for these strains. The regimens have\nbeen based on observational cohort studies and the recommendations of expert panels, taking\ninto account the evolving DST globally. The regimes have been suggested with the underlying\nassumption that the pattern of drug resistance has not changed between the initial sputum\ncollections and initiating the re-design of the anti-TB drug regimen. In patients with rifampicin-resistant TB, a regimen with at least five effective TB medicines\nduring the intensive phase is recommended, including pyrazinamide and four core second-line\nTB medicines - one chosen from group A, one from group B, and at least two from group C\n(conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). If the minimum of effective TB\nmedicines cannot be composed as above, an agent from group D2 and other agents from D3\nmay be added to bring the total to five (refer to Table 8, Chapter 7).

However, treatment may be delayed until the second trimester if the patient is stable with\nminimum disease. \u2022 The treatment regimen should contain three or four second-line anti-TB drugs which are\nlikely to be effective plus pyrazinamide and reinforced with an injectable agent and other\ndrugs as needed immediately postpartum. \u2022 Fluoroquinolones, cycloserine, paraaminosalicylic acid (PAS) and amoxicillin/clavulanate)\nshould be considered as the drug of choice when selecting drugs for MDR-TB treatment. \u2022 Injectable agents should be avoided. However, capreomycin may be considered in life\nthreatening situation due to MDR/XDR TB. \u2022 Capreomycin thrice weekly from the start may be considered to decrease drug exposure\nto the foetus if an injectable agent need to be given. \u2022 Injectable agent may be given for three to six months postpartum even in the middle of\ntreatment but it is not necessary if the patient remain well and past eight months period\nfor injectable agent. \u2022 Ethionamide should be avoided due to risk of nausea and vomiting associated with\npregnancy, and potential teratogenic effects. \u2022 Termination of pregnancy should be considered if the mother\u2019s life is compromised.4\n\u2022 Treatment should be given for duration the same as for standard MDR-TB treatment. 9.2 Breastfeeding\nTransmission of DR-TB during breast feeding may occur from the mother to the baby especially\nin smear positive cases. Small concentration of all second-line drugs is found in breast milk,\nhowever any effect to breast fed infant has not been established.

There is no contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives with non-rifamycin containing\nregimens for MDR-TB, however some patient may develop nausea and vomiting which may\naffect absorption and reduce efficacy of oral contraceptive drugs. Rifampicin used for patients\nwith mono- and poly-resistant TB but who are susceptible to rifampicin interacts with the\ncontraceptive drugs resulting in decreased efficacy of protection against pregnancy\nRecommendation 9\n\u2022 All sexually active women receiving therapy for drug-resistant TB must use effective\ncontraception. \u2022 Patients who vomits after taking anti-TB drugs should be advised to take their\ncontraceptive at different time, use barrier methods or contraceptive implants. A woman on oral contraception while receiving rifampicin treatment may choose between\ntwo options:\n\u2022\nuse an oral contraceptive pill containing a higher dose of estrogen (50ug) or\n\u2022\nuse another form of contraception\nCondoms are a reasonable solution for patients who do not want to take additional pills and/or\nwhen protection against sexually transmitted diseases is also needed. Medroxyprogesterone intramuscular injections and other methods of contraception can also be\nconsidered (refer to medical eligibility criteria for contraception WHO 2004 document). 9.4 Renal insufficiency\nRenal insufficiency can be due to longstanding TB infection, previous use of aminoglycoside\nand other causes.

Rifampicin is least likely to cause hepatocellular damage, although it is\nassociated with cholestatic jaundice. Pyrazinamide is the most hepatotoxic of the three first-line\ndrugs. Among the second-line drugs, ethionamide, prothionamide and PAS can also be\nhepatotoxic, although less so than any of the first-line drugs. Fluoroquinolones can rarely cause\nhepatitis.

Recommendation 10\n\u2022 Patients with chronic liver diseases should not receive pyrazinamide but all other drugs\ncan be used with close monitoring of liver enzymes. In acute hepatitis, it is possible to defer anti-TB treatment until it has been resolved but in other\ncases when it is necessary to treat drug-resistant TB during acute hepatitis, the combination of\nfour non hepatotoxic drugs is the safest option. Viral hepatitis should be treated if medically indicated and treatment can occur during drugresistant TB treatment. 9.6 Seizure disorders\nThe initial step in evaluating patients with current or previous seizure disorder is to assess\nwhether the seizure is under control and whether the patient is taking antiepileptic drugs. Initiation or adjustment of antiepileptic drugs is needed if the seizure is not under control as well\nas correcting underlying conditions or causes of seizures. Cycloserine should be avoided if possible in patients with active seizure disorders that are\nnot well controlled\nRecommendation 11\n\u2022 The risks and benefits of using cycloserine should be discussed with the patient and the\ndecision on whether to use cycloserine should be made together with the patient. \u2022 High dose isoniazid should be avoided in patients with active seizure disorders because it\ncarries higher risk of seizure. \u2022 Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) can be used prophylactically in patients with seizure disorders to\nprotect against the neurological adverse effects of isoniazid or cycloserine. Prophylactic dose of pyridoxine for at-risk patients on isoniazid is 10 to 25 mg/day and for\npatients on cycloserine is 25 mg of pyridoxine for every 250 mg of cycloserine daily. Isoniazid and rifampicin use in mono and poly-resistant cases may interfere and interact with\nmany of the antiepileptic medications.

All health\ncare workers treating drug-resistant TB should work closely with a mental health specialist and\neasy access to emergency and other psychiatric treatment should be made available easily. 9.8 DR-TB in children\nChildren with DR-TB generally acquire the disease transmitted from adult with drug-resistant\nTB. Young children living with DR-TB patients, have high risk of being infected and developing\nactive DR-TB. The clinical presentation of drug-resistant TB in children is similar to drugsensitive TB disease. Criteria for suspecting DR-TB in children include:\n\u2022 Close contact with a person with confirmed or suspected DR-TB. \u2022 History of previously treated TB present with recurrence of the disease. \u2022 Failure to respond to first line TB treatment despite good adherence. The diagnostic workup of DR-TB in a child should include the following:\n\u2022\nclinical evaluation by a paediatrician (including history and physical examination)\n\u2022\na chest radiograph and other diagnostic tests (as indicated)\n\u2022\ntuberculin skin testing\n\u2022\nsputum / gastric lavage investigations: smear microscopy, culture and rapid DST (Xpert\nMTB/RIF assay)\n\u2022\nHIV testing\nIn cases of extrapulmonary TB, fine needle aspiration or biopsy should be considered. Specimens obtained must be sent for diagnostic TB testings, also microbiological culture and\nhistopathological examination to rule out other infective or non-infective diseases. Recommendation 13\n\u2022 Children with DR-TB should be referred to paediatrician with experience in TB\nmanagement. Management of DR-TB (First Edition)\n40\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n40\nInformation on paediatric DR-TB and reported experience on the use of second-line drugs\n(injectable anti-TB) for extended periods in children is very limited. Thus far, the second-line\nanti-TB drugs were reported to be well tolerated in children who have received the therapy. However, in children with mild forms of disease, second-line anti-TB drugs may be avoided. If\nthe use of the drugs is inevitable the risks and benefits of each drug should be discussed with\nfamily members at the outset of therapy.

DR-TB AND HIV INFECTION\nHIV is a significant risk factor for all forms of TB, both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant. The\npresence of HIV coinfection makes the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB more\nchallenging, especially in MDR- and XDR-TB. HIV infected patients are more likely to have smear-negative TB or extrapulmonary TB\n(including MDR-TB and XDR-TB). DR-TB is associated with higher mortality rates in the HIV-infected patients\nEarly diagnosis of the DR-TB and HIV infection, prompt treatment with appropriate 2nd line antiTB drugs, timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, strong infection control measures and good\nsocial support are all crucial components in management of DR-TB in people living with HIV. For patients with advanced HIV disease, mycobacterial culture of sputum and other fluids\n(e.g. blood, pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid and bone-marrow aspirates) and\nhistopathology (e.g. lymph node biopsies) are helpful in diagnosis. ART is recommended for all patients with HIV and DR TB requiring second-line anti-TB\ndrugs, irrespective of CD4 cell-count, as early as possible (within the first 8 weeks) following\ninitiation of anti-TB treatment\nA common first line ART regime used in HIV infected patients with MDR-TB is AZT + 3TC +\nEFV. TDF is generally avoided due to the overlapping renal toxicity with the injectables, but AZT\n(anaemia) and d4T (peripheral neuropathy) have even more common side effects that may\nmake them unsuitable for some MDR- and XDR-TB patients.", "chunk_order": 37}

If TDF is used, additional\nmonitoring of renal function and electrolytes is indicated. Immune reconstitute inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an augmented inflammatory response\nthat occurs in patients commenced on HAART and anti-TB drugs. IRIS generally presents within three months of the initiation of ART and is more common\nwith a low CD4 cell count (<50 cells/mm3). This syndrome can present as a paradoxical worsening of the patient\u2019s clinical status\nThe treatment of DR-TB in patients with HIV is very similar to that in patients without HIV, with\nthe following exceptions: the need of ART and possibility of IRIS, the potential drug-drug\ninteraction between ART and anti-TB drugs and more frequent adverse effects requiring more\nintense monitoring. People living with HIV need to be given the same consideration for treatment with the shorter\nMDR-TB treatment regimen as people who are HIV seronegative. The composition of the treatment regimen for MDR-TB does not differ for people living with HIV. However, thioacetazone should not be given to patients who are HIV positive; if it is being\nconsidered as part of a treatment regimen HIV infection needs to be reliably excluded in the\npatient. Management of DR-TB (First Edition)\n44\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n44\nRecommendation 15\n\u2022 Provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling should be performed in all TB suspects\n\u2022 Mycobacterial cultures should be sent. DST should be done at the start of anti-TB to avoid\nmortality due to unrecognized DR-TB in HIV-infected patients\n\u2022 Xpert MTB/RIF should be used as the initial diagnostic test in HIV- associated TB (WHO\n2014)\n\u2022 The extent (or prevalence) of anti-TB drug resistance in HIV-infected patients should be\ndetermined\n\u2022 Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated promptly in DR-TB/HIV patients, irrespective of\nCD4 cell-count, within the first 8 weeks of starting anti-TB drugs (WHO 2011, 2014)\n\u2022 Co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) should be provided to all HIV- infected patients\nwith active TB\n\u2022 Additional nutritional and socioeconomic support may be implemented\n\u2022 Effective infection control measures should be ensured\n\u2022 Overlapping toxicities with ART and DR-TB therapy should be closely monitored\nFor drug- drug interaction summary and potential overlapping and additive toxicities of ART and\nanti-TB treatment refer to Appendix 5.

Recommendation 16\n\u2022 The use of sputum smear microscopy and culture rather than sputum smear microscopy\nalone is recommended for the monitoring of patients with multidrug- resistant TB (MDRTB) during treatment. Culture conversion should not be taken as equivalent to cure. Monthly sputum smear and TB\nculture should continue to be performed during maintanence phase. This is because Initial\nculture conversion is not always maintained. Some patients can have culture reversion in a later\ndate. Molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF and line probe assays should not be used to monitor\nresponse to treatment. DST can be repeated for patients who remain smear and culture positive or who are suspects\nfor treatment failure. In such cases, it is usually not necessary to repeat DST within less than\ntwo to three months of the previous DST. A key component of monitoring the progress of treatment is patient-centred DOT. All treatment\nshould be given under daily DOT and DOT providers should be trained on the symptoms of\nadverse effects and treatment failure.

MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EFFECTS\nUp to 70% of patients developed some forms of adverse effects from the MDRTB treatment. Some patients may need treatment interrupted or modified due to adverse effect. Managing\nadverse reaction is vital to ensure success to treatment. Ignoring patient\u2019s compliant on adverse\ndrug effect will only leads to non-compliant and failure of treatment. 12.1 Monitoring for adverse effects during treatment\nClose monitoring of patients is necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of second-line antiTB drugs are recognized quickly. All patients on second-line anti-TB drugs should be put under\nDOT. The major advantage of DOT is the ability to monitor adverse effect early, besides\nensuring compliance. All DOT providers should be trained to screen patients regularly for symptoms of common\nadverse effects. During each patient visit, a systematic method for screening of drugs adverse\nreaction should be done by DOT provider. Some common adverse drug events are listed in\ntable 20. Table 20: Common or relevant adverse effects of drug-resistant TB therapy\nNausea/vomiting\nAbdominal pain\nVisual disturbances\nDiarrhoea\nAnorexia\nSeizures\nArthralgia\nGastritis\nHypothyroidism\nDizziness/vertigo\nPeripheral neuropathy\nPsychosis\nHearing disturbances\nDepression\nSuicidal ideation\nHeadache\nTinnitus\nHepatitis (hepatotoxicity)\nSleep disturbances\nAllergic reaction\nRenal failure (nephrotoxicity)\nElectrolyte disturbances\nRash\nQT prolongation\nThere are a number of relatively common toxicities that are complicated to monitor, and can be\nlife threatening or very disabling to the patient; they necessitate extra attention in monitoring\n(refer to table 21).

Assessment of the patient\u2019s psychosocial condition should be\nperformed monthly. 12.2 Management of adverse effects\nProper management of adverse effects begins with education of all stakeholders involved in\ntreatment and care. Prompt evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of adverse effects are\nimportant, even if the adverse effect is not particularly dangerous. Patients may have significant\nfear and anxiety about an adverse effect if they do not understand why it is happening. These\nemotions can result in non-compliance to treatment. If the adverse effect is mild and not dangerous, continuing the treatment regimen with the help\nof ancillary drugs if needed is often the best option. The adverse effects of a number of secondline drugs are highly dose dependent. Reducing the dosage of the offending drug is another\nmethod of managing adverse effects but only in cases where the reduced dose is still expected\nto produce adequate serum levels and not compromise the regimen. Lowering the dose by\nmore than one weight class should be avoided. Temporarily suspending the offending drug can be tried initially to alleviate adverse effects. The\noffending drug can be re-introduced later if needed, in smaller dose initially and slowly titrate up\nto optimal dose to improve tolerability. Suspending permanently the offending drug may be the last option in dealing with serious\nadverse effect. Usually required replacement with another effective agent. However, a\nsatisfactory replacement may not be available, and this can resulting in lots of regimen efficacy,\nthus potentially treatment failure. Some adverse effects may disappear or diminish with time, and patients may be able to\ncontinue receiving the drug if sufficiently motivated. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) should be given to all patients receiving cycloserine or terizidone to help\nprevent neurological adverse effects. The recommended dose is 50 mg for every 250 mg of\ncycloserine (or terizidone) prescribed.

TREATMENT DELIVERY AND COMMUNITY BASED DRUG-RESISTANT TB SUPPORT\nTreatment adherence is one of the important factors to achieve successful DR-TB treatment. Although treatment has been provided at hospital and clinic settings, the delivery of such care\nand support at community-based setting or ambulatory care is now being emphasised. The multidisciplinary team involves community health workers (CHWs). Adherence to therapy requires adequate support measures which include enablers and\nincentives:\n\u2022 TB health education should include topic on adherence to therapy and continuously given\nthroughout the course of treatment. The education can be provided by HCWs and the\nmaterials used are culturally-sensitive. \u2022 DOT is a must in all DR-TB which can be provided by any trained and reliable supervisor\nin all settings. It should be patient and family friendly. Strict confidentiality should be\nmaintained. \u2022 Socioeconomic problems should be addressed to enable patients and families to adhere\nwhich include enablers and incentives\n\u2022 Psychosocial and emotional support by multidisciplinary team should be offered to\novercome stigma and adverse effects of long term treatment\n\u2022 A workable system for monitoring and tracing for lost to follow up patient must be in place. The approach should be in a sympathetic and non-judgemental. Patients with DR-TB are more likely to have history of non-adherence. Adherence is difficult\nbecause of prolonged treatment regimens, multiple drugs and adverse effects. The choice for\ntreatment delivery setting should emphasise on steady drugs supply, free of charges and\nreliable network of educated providers. 13.1 Community based care\nCommunity based care should be provided by the community or organizations where patient are\ngiven ambulatory treatment. CHWs need appropriate training, support, continuous supervision\nby health personnel, visit patient at home or workplace and ideally should not be a family\nmember to prevent patient manipulation.

PALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CARE\nPatients who their second-line anti-TB have been stopped because of treatment failure still need\nto be alleviated of their suffering and prevent further transmission. 14.1 Approach to suspending therapy\nMedical therapy suspension is recommended when there are no more options of drugs to be\nprescribed and surgery is also not an option. Three considerations that then need to be considered are:\n\u2022\nthe patient\u2019s quality of life: Adverse effects from drugs of a failing regime may cause\nunnecessary suffering. \u2022\nthe public health interest: Continuing a failing regime will create highly resistant strains\nthat will infect others. \u2022\nthe model of care available: The available resources to provide palliative care and\ninfection control. A multi-disciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurses, DOT providers, patients and their\ncarers must come up with a plan that covers all the above. 14.2 Palliative and end-of-life care for patients in whom all the possibilities of treatment\nhave failed\nPalliative care delivery can be delivered either in a hospital, palliative care units and patient\u2019s\nhome.", "chunk_order": 46}

The benefits for MDR-TB patients to receive palliative care are that it:\n\u2022 provides relief from respiratory distress, pain and other symptoms;\n\u2022 affirms life and regards dying as a normal process;\n\u2022 intends neither to hasten nor to postpone death;\n\u2022 integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care;\n\u2022 offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death;\n\u2022 offers a support system to help the family cope during the patient\u2019s illness and in their own\nbereavement;\n\u2022 uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including\nbereavement counselling, if indicated;\n\u2022 enhances quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness; and\n\u2022 is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with second-line anti-TB\nmedications, with the main therapy intended to prolong life through cure. Supportive care measures are summarized in Table 22. 14.3 Infection control measures and domicile considerations for the end-of-life MDR-TB\npatient\nPatients whom treatment has been stopped remain infectious. Environmental and Personal\nProtection measures must be in place. Particulate respirators (N95) masks must be used by\ncare givers and health care providers. Management of DR-TB (First Edition)\n55\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n55\nTable 22: End of life supportive measures\n\u2022 Relief from dyspnoea. Oxygen may be used to alleviate shortness of breath in some\ncases but there is no significant evidence to generalize its practice. Morphine provides\nsignificant relief from respiratory insufficiency and should be offered according to\nestablished clinical protocols available in the medical literature. \u2022 Relief from pain and other symptoms. Paracetamol, or codeine with paracetamol,\ngives relief from moderate pain. If possible, stronger analgesics, including morphine,\nshould be used when appropriate to keep the patient adequately comfortable.

Nausea and vomiting or any other conditions that interfere\nwith nutritional support should be treated. \u2022 Regular medical visits. When MDR-TB treatment stops, regular visits by health-care\nproviders and the support team should be continued to address medical needs and\nensure that infection control practices are being followed. \u2022 Continuation of ancillary medicines. All necessary ancillary medications should be\ncontinued as needed. Codeine helps control cough, as well as pain. Other cough\nsuppressants can be added. Bronchospasms can be controlled with a metre-dosed\ninhaler with a spacer or mask. Depression and anxiety, if present, should be addressed. Antiemetic\u2019s may still be needed and fever treated if the patient is uncomfortable. \u2022 Hospitalization, hospice care or nursing home care. Having a patient die at home can\nbe difficult for the family and the other way around. Home-based care should be offered to\npatients and families who want to keep the patient at home, whenever appropriate\ninfection control practices can be followed. Institutionally based end of- life care should be\navailable to those for whom home care is not feasible or desirable. Availability of\nrespiratory isolation facilities is essential when a patient is transferred to institutionally\nbased palliative care for medical reasons and the patient remains infectious. \u2022 Preventive measures. Oral care, prevention of bedsores, bathing and prevention of\nmuscle contractures are indicated in all patients. Regular scheduled movement of the\nbedridden patient is very important. Encourage patients to move their bodies in bed if\nable. Keeping beds dry and clean are also important. \u2022 Provide psychosocial support. Psychological counselling to the patient and family\ncaregivers is critical at this stage, especially to assist patients in the planning of decisions\nrelated with the end of life, and provide emotional support, especially in settings in which\nstrong stigma is attached to the disease. \u2022 Respect for patient\u2019s beliefs and values at the end of life. It is common for the patient\nand family caregivers to develop or increase their interest in spiritual and religious matters\nonce they perceive that the end of life is approaching. The healthcare providers should\nrespect those beliefs and should not impose personal values and practices that prevent\nthe patient to seek and find comfort in the services delivered by faith-based organizations.

MANAGEMENT OF CONTACTS OF MDR/ XDR-TB PATIENTS\nContacts of MDR/XDR-TB patient are defined as people living in the same household,\nworkplace or spending many hours a day together with the index case in the same indoor living\nspace. However there is no universal definition on duration of exposure for close contacts or\ncasual contact. Therefore, the operational definition for MDR/XDR-TB varies between regions,\ncountries and states. Close contacts are likely to be infected because they have a long and frequent exposure with\ninfectious patient. They are also more likely to develop active TB because of their exposure. The investigation for the contacts of MDR/XDR-TB is to prevent the transmission of the resistant\nstrain either inside or outside the home or at workplace so that they can be treated immediately. It also can provide the opportunity to educate the contacts about issues related to TB and\nMDR/XDR-TB\nManagement of MDR/XDR-TB contacts should be integrated into the Programmatic\nManagement of MDR/XDR-TB. General considerations should be given to MDR/XDR-TB\ncontacts:\n\u2022\nScreening for MDR-TB contact should be given high priority\n\u2022\nScreening for XDR-TB contact should be considered as an emergency situation\n\u2022\nAll contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patient should have a proper follow-up\nAll MDR/XDR-TB cases need urgent attention and therefore a structured programme for\nmanagement of case and their contacts should be in place to contain the disease\n(containment phase). Close contacts of MDR/XDR-TB are at high risk of being infected by the index case and\ndeveloping active TB. 15.1 Management of contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patients\nAll contacts of MDR/XDR-TB patients must be identified promptly for evaluation of active TB\ndisease. Close contacts of MDR/XDR-TB should be screened more aggressive than among\nthose contacts of the drugs susceptible cases.

MANAGEMENT OF SECOND- LINE ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS\nDrug management of second-line anti-TB provides information on the procedures for\nprocurement and management of the second-line drugs used in the treatment of DR-TB. DR-TB must be managed appropriately in order to ensure that the correct medicines are\nselected, procured in the right quantities, distributed to treatment centres in a timely manner,\nhandled and stored to maintain quality and availability of sufficient stocks, and used rationally by\nthe health worker and patient alike. Figure 9 shows pharmaceutical management cycle of\nsecond-line anti-TB drugs. Fig. 9: Pharmaceutical Management Cycle\nDescription of key functions of the drug management cycle\nQuantification: sometimes called forecasting quantification is a process used to estimate the\namount of medicines and commodities needed by the national TB control programme for a\nperiod of time. Quantification is a key planning step to prepare and justify budgets for\nprocurement. Procurement is timely acquisition of quality-assured anti-TB medicines and\ncommodities at the best possible cost. Distribution is the process by which medicines are receives at the port of entry, cleared\nthrough customs, transported from the central warehouse to storage and health facilities,\nstore and maintained at warehouses and treatment centres.

Factors to be considered when selecting second- line drugs include the efficacy of the\ndrugs, the treatment strategy, possible adverse effects and the cost of the treatment. 17.2 Quantification and procurement\n17.2.1 Quantification. In order to procure appropriate quantities of these medicines, TB managers need to know how\nmany patients are currently under different treatment regimens and how many patients are\nexpected to be enrolled for each treatment regimen during the next planned procurement\nperiod. The following formula is used for quantification for total drug requirement:\nTotal drug requirement = (consumption of new patients) + (consumption of ongoing\npatients) \u2013 (stock on hand)\nSteps in forecasting of second-line anti-TB drug:\n1. Obtain the following information and use the formula below to get the drug requirement for\nnew patient enrolment:\n\u2022\nNumber of new patients enrolled\n\u2022\nTreatment regimen being used and duration of treatment for both intensive and\ncontinuation phases (calculated in days per month x months of treatment)\n\u2022\nAverage daily dose per drug\n\u2022\nPercentage (%) of utilization per drug\n17.2.2 Procurement\nEffective management of procurement ensures the availability of selected drugs of assured\nstandards of quality, in the right quantities, at the right time and at affordable prices.

During\nthis process, second-line anti-TB drugs can be stored at different warehouses and treatment\ncentres. Ordering medicines can occur in two ways \u2013 push and pull depending on whether the order is\nplaced by the treatment centre (pull) or whether the order quantities are decided by the TB\ncoordinator (push) at the district or national level. When placing orders, a standardized form\nshould be used so that medicines, strengths and dosage forms are correct for the treatment\nregimens established by the TB programme. 17.4 Rational medicine use and adherence\nIn the specific case of DR-TB treatment, the best way to implement a rational use of drugs is to\nfollow the treatment recommendations. This will ensure the maximum benefit to the patients and\nto the health programme at the same time. This has to be complemented with full adherence to\na properly prescribed treatment. From a drug management perspective, the health worker\nshould check that the patient knows at least the following about their treatment:\n\u2022\nName of their TB medicines\n\u2022\nNumber of tablets in one dose\n\u2022\nNumber of doses to take per day\n\u2022\nWhen to return to the TB centre for more medicines\n\u2022\nNeed to report to the health care provider any adverse reactions that are encountered while\ntaking second-line anti-TB drugs. A structured pharmacovigilance system in the programme is encouraged to ensure patients\u2019\nsafety and proper management of any side effects. If adverse reactions are encountered, these\nshould be recorded in the patient\u2019s case note and reported using the Adverse Drug Reaction\n(ADR) form.

MANAGING DR-TB THROUGH PATIENT-CENTRED CARE\nMDR-TB often inflicts the poorest and most marginalized members of a society. Their quality of\nlife and financial situation are further aggravated by the disease, due to the adverse drug\nreactions produced by its treatment, the catastrophic costs they incur while seeking care and\nadhering to treatment and the stigma attached to the disease and subsequent discrimination. The delivery of social support services is important and runs parallel with the efforts to prevent\nand treat MDR-TB. Social support may also contribute to improving the quality of life of patients. In many cases it\nalso makes a difference to enable the patient and family to access health care. In this chapter the patient-centred care approach to directly observation of therapy and the\nsocial support framework for programmatic management of drug-resistant TB are discussed. 19.1 Patient-centred care and its role in DOT\nAdherence to DR- TB treatment is essential for cure. It is particularly difficult because of the\ncurrent lengthy recommended treatment regimens, the daily high pill burden, the frequent and\nserious drug adverse reactions, and the indirect social and economic costs to patients\nassociated with access to care. Thus, MDR-TB patients are at increased risk of poor adherence\nto treatment. The patient-centred approach of the WHO TB strategy consists of enabling patients to exercise\ntheir rights and fulfil their responsibilities with transparency, respect and dignity, by giving due\nconsideration to their values and needs. This may increase the chances of successful treatment\noutcomes, and improve wellbeing and financial risk protection by improving adherence to\ntreatment, benefiting patients and society as a whole. Given that MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treatment are often the last\ntherapeutic option for many patients and that there are serious public health consequences if\ntreatment fails, it is advisable that all patients receive medicines under DOT as a way to ensure\nfull adherence to treatment. Recommendation 22\n\u2022\nPatient-centred approach to treatment should be developed for all patients in order to\npromote adherence and improve quality of life. This approach should be based on the\npatient\u2019s needs and mutual respect between the patient and the provider. 19.2 Social support in MDR-TB management\nSocial support refers to the person\u2019s perception and confirmation that he/she is part of a social\nnetwork that cares for him/her. A large body of evidence has confirmed that social support is a\npredictor of health status and mortality. Social support is determined by access to four\nresources:\ni. Informational support refers to any useful information that helps a person to solve\nproblems. ii. Emotional support refers to all expressions of care that contribute to strengthen selfesteem through empathy, trust, encouragement and care, and helps with the\npsychological challenges in life. iii. Companionship support refers to the help that makes a person feel that he or she\nbelongs to the social network, and that he or she can rely on it for certain needs. iv.", "chunk_order": 57}

Education can be provided by: physicians, nurses, community health workers and\nother health-care providers. Materials should be appropriate to the literacy levels of the patient\nand should be gender, age and culturally sensitive. Tips for delivering key information to the MDR-TB patient\n\u2022\nAlways use a venue that guarantees confidentiality in communication. \u2022\nUse language that reassures mutual respect and esteem between the patient,\ncaregivers and health-care providers. \u2022\nDo not make promises that the health-care service cannot keep. \u2022\nAvoid arguments and any discriminatory remarks for whatever conditions the patient\nhas. \u2022\nRespect the patient\u2019s right to choose. \u2022\nTeach the patient how DR-TB can be transmitted (long exposure to contaminated air in\ncrowded conditions), how it cannot be transmitted (sexual relations, kisses, sharing\ncutlery and clothes, etc.), and teach the essentials about household infection control\nmeasures\n\u2022\nWhile respecting patient\u2019s religious beliefs explore proactively and clarify wrong notions\nthe patient may have about the disease and its treatment, especially those that may\nbecome barriers to adhere to treatment. \u2022\nEnable the patient to counteract stigma and discrimination by reassuring that his/ her\ndisease is not the result of any socially or morally inappropriate behaviour that he/she\nhas made in the past; and that many other patients have passed successfully through a\nsimilar experience\n19.2.2 Information support on MDR-TB treatment\nThere should be a well-formulated plan for preparing the patient for treatment. This includes\neducating the patient and caretaker on the use of drugs, length of treatment, possible side\neffects, and mechanisms to access support that will be available to the patient. Patient\ninformation and education takes place over several visits with different health-care providers\n(from the DOT provider to the physician). Information and educational pamphlets with reminders\nof the main points, in the local language, are helpful.", "chunk_order": 58}

Management of DR-TB (First Edition)\n69\nManagement of DR-TB (First Edition)\n69\nChecklist of information and education issues to provide to patient and family\ncaregivers before starting MDR-TB treatment\n\u2022 Inform the patient about the length of treatment according to the regimen selected \u2013\noften at least 20 months, but it may be shorter or longer. \u2022 Discuss where treatment will start. If at a hospital, estimate the approximate length of\ntime. If at home, ask about the home living situation and whether or not the patient feels\nhome treatment will be possible. \u2022 Teach the patient about the drugs in general terms: i.e. there are at least five different\nanti-TB drugs, which the patient will take, of which one is an injectable agent. Try to\nteach the names of the drugs and show what the pills look like. \u2022 Teach the patient about possible side effects and the actions to take once detected,\nincluding reporting to the DOT provider, especially those with serious consequences\nlike any hearing loss, ringing in the ears or suicidal ideation. \u2022 Teach the patient about monitoring requirements for smear, culture and laboratory tests\nfor early detection of side effects. \u2022 Make sure that patients and caregivers know how to make an appointment if they need\nto be seen before the next routine visit. \u2022 Make sure they know that the DOT provider can contact a doctor urgently at any time of\nthe day. \u2022 Instruct them what to do in case of an emergency (like severe shortness of breath,\nseizure, etc.)\n\u2022 Always provide a copy of the TB Patient Charter, informing the patients about their\nrights and responsibilities related with the treatment and prevention and control of TB;\n\u2022 Inform patient and family caregivers on social support and social protection options the\npatient is eligible for according to the existing law in the country, including palliative and\nend-of-life care as needed. 19.2.3 Emotional support\nHaving MDR-TB can be an emotionally devastating experience for patients and their social\nnetworks. Considerable stigma is attached to the disease, and this may interfere with adherence\nto therapy, and may badly affect the quality of life of patients in view of the discrimination that\nfollows stigma. The provision of emotional support services to patients may increase the likelihood of therapy\nadherence, and the acquisition of skills to deal with stigma and discrimination. This support may\nbe organized in the form of support groups or in one-to one counselling by trained providers. Informal support can also be provided by physicians, nurses, DOT providers, drug-resistant TB\nsupporters and family members.", "chunk_order": 59}

Every effort should be\nmade to listen to the patient\u2019s reasons for missing a dose(s) and to work with the patient and the\nfamily to ensure continuation of treatment. The following steps should be taken for patients showing any signs of possible poor adherence:\n\u2022\nHome visit by the health-care provider involved in the drug-resistant TB programme: The\ndrug-resistant TB clinic or community nurse, doctor or supervisor should visit the home of\nthe patient together with, or in addition to, the drug-resistant TB DOT supporter, as during\nthe home visit it may be possible to identify more clinical problems than during the monthly\nclinic evaluation. \u2022\nManage side effects: This is one of the most common reasons for the MDR-TB patient to be\nlost to follow-up. \u2022\nCounselling: The patient may no longer want to continue treatment because he/she feels\nbetter, and therefore, feels treatment is no longer necessary. Additionally, the patient\u2019s\nperspective about his/her care should be assessed. The patient may have greater\nconfidence in alternative or folk medicine. If this is the case, the drug-resistant TB DOT\nsupporter, along with a nurse, doctor or community supervisor, should explore ways in\nwhich to meet the patient\u2019s needs, all the while putting them back on treatment. \u2022\nAddress economic problems: Many patients are unable to work when they are ill, and may\nbe the primary wage earners for their family. An assessment related to basic housing, food\nand clothing needs should be explored and ways to assist with these issues addressed. \u2022\nAddress addiction or other social problems: Alcohol consumption and drug abuse are known\nissues, which affect treatment adherence. Patients should be encouraged to stop or\ndecrease consumption. \u2022\nInvolve the family: Family is the most important source of psychosocial support for the\npatient. When a patient has no family, have the patient identify a person who can act as a\ncaregiver. \u2022\nInvolve community leaders: Community and religious leaders can be helpful if there are\ncommunity-wide issues, such as stigma towards drug-resistant TB patients.

In sites\ntesting with Xpert MTB/RIF alone, the indicator can be\nmodified to include all cases with a rifampicin test result\nand the date of the first result showing rifampicin\nresistance is used, regardless of whether the same\npatient\nwas\nconfirmed\nto\nbe\nMDR-TB\nor\nnot\nsubsequently. The calculation is done on all cases with\nDST results for isoniazid and rifampicin (sensitive or\nresistant) entered in the Laboratory register during the\nsix-month period of assessment. The difference in days\nbetween the two dates is summed up for all patients and\ndivided by the number of cases with test results.
