Psychoeducation\n\u2022 Psychoeducation should be offered in attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder. c. Non-pharmacological treatment\n\u2022 Occupational therapy should be offered as an adjunct in attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \u2022 The following therapies should be considered in ADHD:\n\uf0a1 organisational skills training\n\uf0a1 cognitive behavioural therapy-based interventions\n\u2022 Parent training and behavioural intervention should be offered in\nADHD. \u2022 School-based interventions should be offered in ADHD. d.

There was active involvement of a\nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database\nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines\nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans,\n\u201call child (0 to 18 years)\u201d (in most searches), publication from year \u201c2008\nto Current\u201d and English language. In addition, the reference lists of all\nretrieved literature and guidelines were searched and, experts in the\nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom 19 Mac 2017 to 18 May 2018. Literature searches were repeated\nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process\nallowing any relevant papers published before 21 January 2020 to be\nincluded.

References were also made to other CPGs on attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) e.g.:\n\u2022 Canadian ADHD Practice Guidelines (CAP-Guidelines), 4.1\n[Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA), 2020]\n\u2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and\nTreatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children\nand Adolescents [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), 2019]\n\u2022 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: diagnosis and management\n[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 2018]\n\u2022 Management of attention deficit and hyperkinetic disorders in\nchildren and young people [Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines\nNetwork (SIGN), 2009]\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as\nreferences. A total of 14 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 24 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nManagement of Attention-De\ufb01cit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children & Adolescents (Second Edition)\nv\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. This\nCPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, metaanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG\nCouncil MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most\ncommon neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is defined as\na persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactive and impulsive\nbehaviour that is more frequent and severe than is typically seen in a\nchild at a given developmental stage. It appears in childhood and often\nlasts into adulthood. Children and adolescents with ADHD face significant problems in\nbehavioural control, interpersonal relationships, academic performance\nand personal issues.1, 2 They have worse health-related quality of life\nscores than the typically developing groups varying from a small to\nmoderate degree in physical domains and a large degree in psychosocial\ndomains.3 Therefore, early recognition, assessment and management\nof this condition is very important in helping them and their parents to\nimprove the educational and psychosocial difficulties. Worldwide, the estimated prevalence of childhood ADHD is 5.29%.4\nIn Malaysia, the estimated prevalence of ADHD range from 1.6% to\n4.6%.5, 6 Boys are three to four times more likely to be diagnosed with\nADHD than girls.6 - 8\nThis CPG is a full review of the previous edition of guidelines on the\nmanagement of ADHD published in 2008. It aims to reduce variation\nin practice and, address advancement in diagnosis and treatment\nof ADHD. In this edition, a new scope on adult ADHD and transition\nperiod into adulthood is addressed because of its growing significance\nin clinical practice.

Non-pharmacological treatment of ADHD can be initiated by FMS/\nPrimary Care Physician. They can provide psychoeducation and\ngeneral advice on family- and school-based interventions. Patients can\nalso be referred to an occupational therapist for further interventions. 8. REFERRAL\nIn view of no retrievable evidence on referral criteria for ADHD, the\nCPG development group proposes the following terms for referral. \u2022 Patients with ADHD should be referred to the psychiatrist/\npaediatrician when there is:\n\uf0a1 uncertainty of diagnosis\n\uf0a1 lack of response to non-pharmacological treatment\n\uf0a1 indication to start pharmacotherapy\n\uf0a1 severe side effects of medication\n\uf0a1 co-morbidities (e.g. substance abuse)\n\u2022 All pre-schoolers (below six years of age) with suspicion of ADHD\nshould be referred to the child psychiatrist or a paediatrician with\nexpertise in managing ADHD for further management. Management of Attention-De\ufb01cit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children & Adolescents (Second Edition)\n9. MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP\nClinicians should provide regular follow-up for individuals with ADHD. During the follow-up, emphasise treatment adherence and, monitor the\neffectiveness and side effects of medication prescribed.1\nThe following should be monitored during follow-up:\n\u2022 height and weight\n\u2022 vital signs (especially heart rate and rhythm)\n\u2022 loss of appetite\n\u2022 rebound hyperactivity\n\u2022 sleep\n\u2022 worsening behaviour\n\u2022 mood changes\n\u2022 stimulant diversion (giving another person the medication meant\nfor the individual, e.g. giving a friend or selling one\u2019s prescribed\nmedication)\nRefer to Appendix 8 for further information. In addition, for children aged 12 years and above, clinicians should\nassess for changes in mood and presence of risky behaviours\ne.g. intentional self-harm, substance use, suicidal and risky sexual\nbehaviours. 2; 53\nIf a child or adolescent\u2019s growth over time is significantly affected by\nmedication (i.e.", "chunk_order": 21}

If the decision is made to discontinue the\nmedication, it should be done at a low-stress time.2\nParents and adolescents with ADHD are encouraged to discuss any\npreferences to stop or change medication and to be involved in any\ndecision about stopping treatment.1 Medications should be resumed\nin the event of recurrence of symptoms or deterioration in functioning. \u2022 Children with ADHD are eligible to get additional support e.g.:\n\uf0a1 registration for Orang Kurang Upaya (OKU) with District Social\nWelfare Office (Pejabat Kebajikan Masyarakat Daerah)\n\uf0a1 special needs education under District Education Office (Pejabat\nPendidikan Daerah), including inclusive education in the\nmainstream setting\n\uf0a1 examination and classroom accommodation (e.g. extra time,\nreduced distraction)\nManagement of Attention-De\ufb01cit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children & Adolescents (Second Edition)\nRecommendation 11\n\u2022 Healthcare providers should provide continued care and longterm monitoring to children and adolescents with attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder. 10. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of ADHD should be guided by evidence-based\napproach in order to provide quality care to the patients. Several factors\nmay affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 10.1. Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 wide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to healthcare\nproviders\n\u2022 training and updates on ADHD\n\u2022 public awareness campaigns related to mental health\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:\n\u2022 limited exposure and training among healthcare providers on\nmanagement of ADHD\n\u2022 variation in availability of expertise and access to service provision\ndue to financial constraints\n\u2022 lack of awareness among patients, families and educators on ADHD\n10.2. Potential Resource Implications\nIn local scenario, children with ADHD are often missed. Adults and\npeers often consider the children as having behavioural problems,\nnot listening and not putting in effort. They are often labelled, isolated,\nignored or punished. There are also negative/false perceptions regarding ADHD e.g.:\n\u2022 it is not a medical illness\n\u2022 the medications increase the risk of substance use\n\u2022 the condition will disappear as the child gets older\n\u2022 boys are usually hyperactive anyway\n\u2022 only boys have ADHD\nThe CPG recommends early detection and referral, comprehensive\nassessment and treatment of the disorder.", "chunk_order": 22}

This requires increased\nawareness among parents, educators and healthcare providers to\nestablish diagnosis and embark on intervention early. Collaboration\nwith various experts and agencies is required to provide optimal\nManagement of Attention-De\ufb01cit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children & Adolescents (Second Edition)\nmanagement e.g. psychological and behavioural intervention, parent\nand teachers training, and classroom accommodation. Thus, the implementation of this CPG requires resources to provide:\n\u2022 training of healthcare providers and educators\n\u2022 assessment and intervention tools\n\u2022 better access to pharmaco- and non-pharmacological therapy\n\u2022 access to policy makers\nThe following is proposed as clinical audit indicator for quality\nmanagement of ADHD:\n*if their ADHD symptoms are persistent and causing significant\nimpairment in at least one domain despite behavioural and\nenvironmental interventions.

Several other abnormalities may be\nassociated. Hyperkinetic children are often reckless and impulsive,\nprone to accidents, and find themselves in disciplinary trouble because\nof unthinking breaches of rules rather than deliberate defiance. Their\nrelationships with adults are often socially disinhibited, with a lack of\nnormal caution and reserve. They are unpopular with other children\nand may become isolated. Impairment of cognitive functions is\ncommon, and specific delays in motor and language development are\ndisproportionately frequent. Secondary complications include dissocial\nbehaviour and low self-esteem.
