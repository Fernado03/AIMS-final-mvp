Rapid developments have taken place, especially in the area of\npre-hospital care. This 4th edition was developed to provide a clear and concise\napproach based on current evidence with the focus being on efforts to reduce\nthe time from first medical contact, improve pre-hospital care as well support the\napplication of guideline-directed therapies. This CPG has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the National\nHeart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The committee\nmembers were multidisciplinary and comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine,\nfamily medicine, rehabilitation and emergency physicians from the government,\nprivate sector and universities. Relevant clinical trial data and published literature\nhave been summarized and adapted to local practices. This guideline also\nimplemented the work of our very own national STEMI network which links non-PCIcapable centres to PCI-capable centres so PCI services can be arranged in a timely\nmanner for all patients. Ischaemic heart disease has been a significant burden to this country, and it\nis projected that the burden will continue to increase with the rising number of\ncardiovascular risk factors and an ageing population. I believe this CPG will be an\ninvaluable guiding document for healthcare providers involved in the management of\nSTEMI and subsequently be translated to an improved clinical outcome for patients\nsuffering from ischaemic heart disease.", "chunk_order": 0}

With timely intervention and early reperfusion, the\ncardiovascular outcomes have improved. The biggest challenge has been to reduce\nthe total ischaemic time, which is the time from onset of chest pain till the time when\nthe infarct related artery is opened. A large portion of this delay has been the late\npresentation of the patient with AMI to medical attention (onset of chest pain to First\nMedical Contact \u2013 FMC). The 1st Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction\n(STEMI) was published in 2001 with a 2nd and 3rd update in 2007 and 2014\nrespectively.

To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\u2022 Increasing public awareness of CVD in general and educating them on the\nimportance of seeking early medical attention when they have chest pains and\nchest pain equivalents. \u2022 Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the\nimportance of timely reperfusion and appropriate management of patients with\nSTEMI. This can be done by road shows, electronic media, and in-house training\nsessions.

INTRODUCTION\nThe most recent data from the National Department of Statistics Malaysia indicated\nthat in 2014, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was the principal cause of mortality\n(13.7%). For men, it was the principle cause of death (15.2%) and for women, it was\nsecond after pneumonias.1\nMost deaths in STEMI occur within the first hour due to fatal arrhythmias. In addition,\nTIME LOST IS MYOCARDIUM LOST. Thus, early diagnosis and prompt reperfusion\nis important. Based on the latest Malaysian Annual Report of the National Cardiovascular\nDatabase- Acute Coronary Syndrome (NCVD-ACS) Registry 2014-2015 it was noted\nthat:2\n\u2022 The demographics of patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) have not\nchanged over the last 10 years. \u0090 They are young with a mean age of 58.6 years, and about a quarter are below\nthe age of 50 years. This age is lower than that seen in Thailand, Singapore and\nin Western populations.3-5 The patients presenting with ST segment Elevation\nMyocardial Infarction (STEMI) are even younger with a mean age of 56 years. \u0090 Majority of men presented with STEMI (50.5%) whereas women presented with\nNon ST Elevation Acute Coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) (70.8%). NSTE-ACS\nencompasses both Unstable Angina (UA) and Non ST-Elevation Myocardial\nInfarction (NSTEMI). \u0090 There was a high prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes \u2013 the\nprevalence of these risk factors has not changed over the last 10 years. \u2022 The in-hospital mortality following STEMI was 10.6% and that following NSTEACS was 8.0%. \u2022 The STEMI patients were generally more ill. h 67.4% were in the intermediate-high TIMI risk score. h 19.0% were in Killip class III/IV. \u2022 Fibrinolytic therapy was the most common mode of reperfusion (69.1%), and only\n13.7% were treated with primary PCI. Even in PCI capable centres, only 16.4%\nof STEMI patients underwent Primary PCI. About 14% of patients did not receive\nany form of reperfusion treatment due to late presentation, missed and delayed\ndiagnosis. \u0090 The median door-to-needle time (DNT) was 45 minutes and only 35.2%\nachieved the recommended DNT time of < 30 minutes.", "chunk_order": 20}

MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST\nSEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL\nINFARCTION (STEMI) 2019\n40\nKey message #1:\n\u2022 The STEMI mortality (in-hospital, 30 day and 1 year) remains high. \u2022 Data from the latest 2014-2015 NCVD-ACS Registry indicated that patients\nreceiving reperfusion (Primary PCI or fibrinolytic) had better survival\ncompared to patients who did not receive any form of reperfusion. \u2022 Patients who had any form of PCI during the index hospitalisation had better\nshort-term and long-term survival compared to those who did not undergo\nPCI. This is consistent with other registries. The focus is to:\n\u2022 Develop seamless systems and pathways in the management of STEMI patients. \u2022 Improve the quality of care and outcomes. \u2022 Shorten the total ischemic time by:\n\u0090 patient education so that they seek medical attention early. \u0090 improvements in the pre-hospital care, ambulance services and emergency\ndepartment management. \u0090 establishment of STEMI networks of STEMI-referral (non-PCI capable) hospitals\nand STEMI-receiving (PCI capable) hospitals. This network in the Klang Valley is\ncalled MySTEMI. \u2022 Work with payers and policy makers for reimbursement. Guidelines are intended to help in the management of patients. All the\nrecommendations stated in this guideline may not be available to all eligible patients. Patient care should be individualised, and sound clinical judgement still plays an\nimportant role in decision-making. MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST\nSEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL\nINFARCTION (STEMI) 2019\n41\n2. DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a clinical spectrum of Coronary Artery Disease\n(CAD) ranging from Unstable Angina (UA), non-ST segment Elevation Myocardial\nInfarction (NSTEMI) to STEMI depending upon the degree and acuteness of\ncoronary occlusion (Figure 1, pg 43). In UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac\nbiomarkers are normal. In myocardial injury, cardiac biomarkers are raised. It is important to distinguish between myocardial injury and myocardial infarction\n(MI). Myocardial injury may be due to:10\n\u2022 ischaemia and/or\n\u2022 non-ischaemic causes (eg myocarditis, renal failure)\nMI is myocardial injury due to ischaemia.10 It is defined pathologically as myocardial\ncell death due to prolonged ischaemia.10\nThe preferred cardiac biomarkers are the troponins (both I and T). Elevation of\ncardiac troponins indicates myocardial necrosis. A level above the 99th percentile\nof the URL is abnormal and indicative of myocardial injury.10 All locally available\ncommercial assays indicate this level, the exact value varying depending on the\nreagents used. The point of care kits, however, although giving a more rapid result,\nare not sensitive enough to detect this low level. Troponins should always be interpreted in the clinical setting.", "chunk_order": 22}

Many troponin\nelevations, especially below certain cut-off points and troponin elevations without a\nrise and fall, are myocardial injuries and not MI. A rise and/or fall in the troponin level is indicative of acute injury, while a persistently\nelevated level is indicative of chronic injury.10\nMI is diagnosed when there is a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponins, with at least\none value above the 99th percentile of the URL, and accompanied with at least one\nof the following:\ni. Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin of > 30 minutes. ii. ECG changes of ischaemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q\nwaves. iii.

New onset Right Bundle Branch Block with ST elevation of \u2265 1 mm in 2 contiguous\nleads does not interfere with the diagnosis of STEMI. In NSTE-ACS, ST elevation is absent on the resting ECG. In addition, patients having\nprolonged ischaemic type chest pain and having a non-interpretable resting ECG (eg\npaced rhythm, new RBBB etc) without ST elevation are having NSTE-ACS. There are\nseparate guidelines for NSTE-ACS. According to the 4th Universal definition, MI can be classified as 5 types depending\non the pathology, clinical features, prognosis and treatment strategies.10 (Table 5, pg\n44).

The presence of ST elevation in two contiguous leads in a patient with\nsymptoms of ischaemia is the cardinal feature of STEMI. The cut-off points for new or presumed new ST segment elevation at the J point (in\nthe absence of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) and LBBB) is:10\n\u2022 the presence of \u2265 0.1 mV ST segment elevation in all leads except leads V2-V3\n\u2022 a cut-off point of \u2265 0.25 mV (in males < 40 years), \u2265 0.2 mV (in males \u2265 40 years)\nand \u2265 0.15 mV in females is used in leads V2-V3\nIn patients with BBB (new or presumed new), comparison with a previous ECG may\nbe helpful in determining if the changes are pre-existent. The presence of a new\nonset or presumed new LBBB in a patient with typical chest pain of ischaemic origin\nmay indicate an infarct and should be treated as STEMI.13\nPatients with ischaemic type chest pain > 30 minutes and new presumed new RBBB\naccompanied with:10\n\u2022 ST segment elevation \u2265 1 mm - should be managed as STEMI\n\u2022 ST-segment depression or T wave abnormalities (excluding those in leads V1\u2013V4)\n\u2013 should be managed as NSTEMI. If pain persists, they should be considered for\nan early PCI strategy. Acute anterior STEMI with a Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is usually an\nextensive MI due to involvement of the proximal left anterior descending artery or the\nleft main coronary artery. It carries a poor prognosis and these patients should also\nundergo early reperfusion strategies.17 Occasionally, patients with inferior STEMI can\nOther important points to note in the history are the presence of:\n\u2022 Previous history of ischaemic heart disease, PCI or CABG. \u2022 Risk factors for atherosclerosis. \u2022 Symptoms suggestive of previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or other forms\nof vascular disease.", "chunk_order": 26}

In these patients, often the myocardium involved is small and\nthe prognosis is not that bad.14\nGenerally, patients with new onset Bundle Branch Block (BBB) have more\ncomorbidities and a worse prognosis.15,16\nIn the early stages of MI, the initial ECG may be normal, equivocal or show hyperacute\nT-wave changes only. In these patients, if the index of suspicion of STEMI is high,\nthe ECG should be repeated at close intervals of at least 15 minutes to look for\nprogressive ST changes. Comparison with previous ECGs may also be helpful. In\naddition, there are some conditions with ECG changes that can mimic that of STEMI. (Appendix I, pg 118)\nPatients with inferior STEMI should have an ECG recording of the right precordial\nlead (V4R) to identify concomitant right ventricular (RV) involvement.17,18 The cut-off\npoint is \u2265 0.5 mm (\u2265 1 mm in men < 30 years old).10\nIn those with ST segment depression in leads V1-V3, it is advisable to have an ECG\nrecording of the posterior chest wall (V7-V9) to identify a true infero-basal (formerly\nknown as infero-posterior) STEMI.19 The cut-off point for ST segment elevation in the\nposterior leads is \u2265 0.05 mV (\u2265 0.1 mV in men < 40 years).10\nST elevation of > 1mm in lead aVR may accompany anterior or inferior STEMI. This\nis also a predictor of left main/3 vessel CAD and carries an adverse prognosis.20-22\nOccasionally patients with ongoing chest pains and myocardial ischaemia may have\na normal or un-interpretable ECG. If the clinical suspicion of ongoing MI is high,\nimaging techniques such as bedside echocardiogram may be helpful.

The appropriate and timely use of some form of reperfusion therapy is more\nimportant than the choice of therapy. Early and prompt reperfusion is crucial as TIME LOST is equivalent to MYOCARDIUM\nLOST.62,84,85\nPrimary PCI is superior to fibrinolytic therapy as a reperfusion strategy.49-51\nHowever, in patients who present within 3 hours of symptom onset and are at lowrisk, both treatment strategies appear to have similar benefits.86,87\nGenerally, in most of our hospitals, fibrinolytic therapy is more readily available and\nconstitutes the main reperfusion strategy.

SECONDARY PREVENTION\n13.1\nNon-Pharmacological Measures\nImportant lifestyle interventions include:\n\u2022 cessation of smoking,\n\u2022 dietary modification,\n\u2022 weight control and\n\u2022 physical activity. Often, lifetime habits are not easily changed and team work between cardiologists\nand general practitioners, rehabilitative physicians, pharmacists, dieticians,\nphysiotherapists and occupational therapists is needed for implementation and\nfollow-up. 13.1.1. Cessation of Smoking\nSmoking cessation has been consistently associated with a mortality benefit and it\nis one of the cornerstones of secondary prevention.328,329\nIn a cohort of patients with ACS on optimal secondary prevention therapy, those\nwho continued to smoke had an 80% risk of lower survival at a mean follow-up of\n3.9 years while those who quit had comparable survival to lifelong non-smokers.330\nPersistent smokers at 30 days post-PCI experienced an almost twofold increase in\nlong-term mortality.330\nThis underscores the importance of smoking cessation in secondary prevention\ndespite the improvement in management of ACS with PCI and pharmacotherapy. This also emphasises the malignant pathophysiological effects of smoking, namely\nI,A\nMANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ST\nSEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL\nINFARCTION (STEMI) 2019\n96\nendothelial dysfunction, thrombogenicity and coronary vasoconstriction, which\npredispose to ACS.331\n13.1.1.1 Smoking Cessation Interventions\nSmoking cessation is difficult, even after life-threatening ACS. The Melbourne\nRegistry showed that only 54% of patients stopped smoking by 30 days.330 Almost\n23% of those who quit smoking at 30 days had relapsed at 12 months highlighting\nthe difficulty of long-term abstinence.330,332\nHospitalisation for an acute cardiovascular event provides a unique window of\nopportunity to encourage patients to quit smoking. A study has shown that the\nmajority of successful quitters at 1 year stopped immediately after their ACS.333\nHowever, smoking-cessation therapy in hospitalised patients offers challenges. The duration of hospitalisation for acute myocardial infarction is usually brief and\nhospital stay is busy, making it difficult to gain the patient\u2019s full attention for smokingcessation counselling. Nevertheless, effective counselling in the hospital should be\nprovided for all smokers, and not just the minority who are ready to quit.334 Effective\ntransition from inpatient to outpatient smoking cessation treatment should take\nplace, with a minimum of 1-month follow-up.334 MQuit (Quit smoking) Services is\ncurrently available in all health clinics (Klinik Kesihatan) throughout the country. 13.1.1.2 Pharmacotherapy\nPost-STEMI patients usually have been chronic smokers and most of them would\nhave high degree of nicotine dependency.

Thus, they should be given personalised\nsmoking cessation medication intended to relieve withdrawal symptoms and to\nsupport long-term cessation. However, very low rates of these medications are prescribed post-MI, and this rate\nhas declined over time.335 Some clinicians are hesitant to add a smoking-cessation\nmedication on top of a number of other medications that have been initiated or\ncontinued.

Overweight and obesity is associated with higher all-cause mortality compared with\na healthy weight.340\nThus, maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight is recommended for all subjects\nincluding patients with STEMI.340 However, it has not been established that weight\nreduction per se reduces mortality. 13.1.3 Regular Exercise\nThere is increasing evidence that, when adequately prescribed and supervised,\nregular exercise after an MI can prevent future complications and increase the\nquality of life and longevity of these patients338,341,342\nAny amount of physical activity (PA) is better than none; adults engaging in any form\nand amount of PA gain some form of health benefits in both primary and secondary\nprevention.338,342\nFollowing an acute cardiac event or post cardiac surgery, patients should be referred\nto a cardiac rehabilitative physician for exercise prescription.

Therefore, the risk-benefit ratio\nof each intervention should be individualised so that these patients are not excluded\nfrom interventions.373 It is important to assess frailty, general health and functional\nstatus, co-morbidities as well as the particular wishes of the patient and family. In addition, age related differences in physiology can affect disease manifestation,\nbleeding risks, drug metabolism and management. Most MI\u2019s in older patients\nare NSTEMI rather than STEMI.374 Older patients are more likely to develop left\nventricular failure (more than 50% of those aged > 75 years of age) and more than\n>10% develop cardiogenic shock.374,375 This is due to their more extensive disease,\nlate presentation, and age-related changes in cardiac physiology or decreased\nvascular compliance, ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling.375,376\nCKD is common in these patients and may increase the risk of bleeding.375,376 Most\ndrugs are excreted by the kidneys and doses need to be adjusted. Creatinine\nclearance (CrCL) should be estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault and the estimated\nglomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease\nEpidemiology Collaboration) equations or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\n(MDRD) equations. (Appendix VI, pg 124). In the management of STEMI in older patients:\n\u2022 Primary PCI - this is the preferred reperfusion strategy if facilities are available\nand the patient is eligible for PCI.376-381 Procedural success is highly variable. Older\npatients are more likely to have PCI related complications especially bleeding.382\n\u2022 Fibrinolytic therapy - there is an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage in\nolder patients and the risks of bleeding have to be carefully considered in those\nolder than 75 years.383--386 The dose of tenecteplase is 50% of the recommended\ndose in those \u2265 75 years of age.387\n\u2022 Adjunctive therapy - when compared with younger patients, older patients\nhave a greater absolute reduction with most evidence based medications.365 It is\nimportant to balance the risks of polypharmacy and the risks of drug interactions\nwith the benefit of not withholding guideline-directed medications, proven to be\nof benefit in these older individuals.", "chunk_order": 67}

A low blood sugar level (< 4.0 mmol/L)\nhas also been associated with adverse outcomes.
