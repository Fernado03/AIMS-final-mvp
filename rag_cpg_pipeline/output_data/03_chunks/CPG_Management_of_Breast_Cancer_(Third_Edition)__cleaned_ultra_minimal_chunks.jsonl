Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2019 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2023) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or\nomissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this\ndocument, which is the definitive version at all times.

Assessment and Diagnosis\n\u2022 Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS\u00ae) is the\npreferred reporting method in the management of breast cancer. \u2022 Minimally invasive biopsy technique (MIBT) with core needle is the\npreferred diagnostic technique for both palpable and non-palpable\nbreast lesions. \u2022 Repeat image-guided MIBT or consider surgical excision when the\ninitial core biopsy results are non-diagnostic or discordant with the\nimaging findings. \u2022 Estrogen and progesterone receptors status should be assessed in\nall cases of breast cancer. \u2022 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) test using\nimmunohistochemistry should be performed on all invasive breast\ncancer specimens. \u2022 In-situ hybridisation test should be done only in equivocal HER2\n(immunohistochemistry 2+) on invasive breast cancer specimens. \u2022 Patients with early breast cancer and:\n\uf0a1 asymptomatic, routine imaging screening for metastasis should\nnot be performed\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n\uf0a1 with signs and symptoms of lung, liver and bone metastases,\nor abnormal related laboratory tests, the routine imaging\ninvestigations should be performed\n\uf0a1 with localised bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase or\nsymptoms suggestive of bone metastases, bone scintigraphy\nshould be used if plain radiography or computed tomography\nstaging is negative\n\u2022 Patients with locally advanced and advanced breast cancer, imaging\nmodalities e.g. computed tomography, bone scintigraphy, magnetic\nresonance imaging or positron emission tomography/computerised\ntomography should be done to assess the extent of disease\ndepending on the indications. C. Treatment\n\u2022 Multidisciplinary team approach should be considered in the\nmanagement of breast cancer to improve clinical outcomes. \u2022 In women treated with breast conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma\nin situ of <2 mm margin, the benefits and risks of further treatment\n(surgery or radiotherapy) should be discussed to reduce the risk of\nlocal recurrence. \u2022 In early breast cancer patients with clinically lymph nodes negative\nwho have breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph nodes\n(SLNs) biopsy, no further axillary treatment is needed in two or less\npositive SLNs.", "chunk_order": 2}

Management of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n\u2022 Endocrine therapy should be considered as first-line treatment in\nhormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer\nunless there is evidence of visceral crisis or endocrine resistance. \u2022 Bisphosphanates may be offered in breast cancer patients with bone\nmetastases to reduce skeletal-related events. \u2022 All patients with invasive breast cancer who have breast conserving\nsurgery with clear margin should be offered adjuvant radiotherapy. \u2022 Adjuvant radiotherapy should be offered to the following postmastectomy breast cancer patients with:\n\uf0a1 one or more positive lymph nodes\n\uf0a1 positive margin not amenable for surgery\n\u2022 Adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered in node negative T3 or\nT4 breast cancer. D. Fertility Preservation\n\u2022 Fertility preservation should be discussed with all breast cancer\npatients in the reproductive age group and suitable patients should\nbe referred to fertility specialist. E. Familial Breast Cancer\n\u2022 Intensive screening of BRCA carriers and high risk individuals should\nbe vigilantly performed and adhered to recommended guidelines. \u2022 Risk-reducing surgeries should be discussed and offered to women\nwith pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary\nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. The CPG update was done based on the first edition of evidencebased CPG on Management of Breast Cancer (Second Edition), issued\nin 2010. In the update, certain methodology was used e.g. GRADE\nprinciples while the scope on assessment and diagnosis, treatment and\nfamilial breast cancer was expanded. A chapter on fertility preservation\nwas also introduced. A literature search was carried out using the\nfollowing electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane\nDatabase of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines\nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published in the last\nfour years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of\nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify\nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify\nfurther studies. All searches were conducted from 23 November 2017\nto 6 January 2018. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31 July 2019 to be included. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from\nthe CPG Secretariat.

A total of 33 clinical questions were developed under eight different\nsections (risk factors, screening, referral, assessment/diagnosis,\nstaging, treatment, survivorship programme and familial breast\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\nvi\ncancer). Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin eight sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 26 times throughout the development of\nthese guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least\ntwo DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist,\npresented in evidence tables and further discussed in DG meetings. All statements and recommendations subsequently formulated were\nagreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient,\nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, metaanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG strictly\nfollows the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG and, the HTA and CPG\nCouncil MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

Although breast self-examination is not a screening method, it is\nadvocated to raise awareness of breast cancer and empower women\nto take responsibility of their own health.4 Clinical breast examination\n(CBE) is an important component of clinical encounter to maximise\nthe earliest detection of palpable cancers.26 As the incidence of breast\ncancer in Malaysia increases at the age of 35 years,1 CBE is advocated\nto be initiated from this age. In women of European descent, a number of risk assessment tools\n[e.g. Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier\nEstimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), Gail, Tyrer Cuzick] have been\nbuilt using predominantly lifestyle factors and family history of cancers\nin order to estimate an individual woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer. For\nexample, NICE recommends unaffected women aged 35 years and\nolder and with no physical symptoms of breast cancer may be stratified\ninto four categories using BOADICEA risk assessment tool for the\npurpose of screening recommendations:5\n\u2022 average risk (<17% lifetime risk)\n\u2022 moderate risk (>17% but <30% lifetime risk)\n\u2022 high risk (>30% lifetime risk but no known genetic variant)\n\u2022 high risk carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants\nWhilst the above tools are accurate for the population, they are less\nuseful for individual risk prediction.", "chunk_order": 12}

Accuracy of image-guided biopsy\nAll palpable masses should be imaged to see if there is discordance\nin clinical and imaging size. Any discordance should lead to imageguided biopsy and free hand biopsies should be avoided to ensure\ntimely diagnosis. Minimally invasive biopsy technique (MIBT) is the standard of care for\ndiagnosing most breast lesions. Image-guided MIBT is recommended\nfor both palpable and non-palpable lesions to increase accuracy of\nsampling. US, if available, is recommended in patients with palpable\nmasses. If the lesion is non-palpable but visible sonographically, USguidance optimises patient\u2019s comfort.23, level III\nIn all breast lesions, core needle biopsy or vacuum-assisted\ntechnique is preferable to fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)\nfor better characterisation of tumour type, marker analysis and\nimmunohistochemistry.23, level III\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\nPathology and imaging concordance by MIBT shows a success rate of\n90% or greater.23, level III\ne.

In cases where PMRT\nis anticipated, the optimum timing and methods of BR need to be\nconsidered before the surgery. When an immediate BR is intended, a two-stage implant-based\nreconstruction is recommended.26; 41, level III; 49, level III The first stage\ninvolves placement of tissue expander (TE) followed by expansion of\nthe expander within 1 - 6 months. In the second stage, the TE can\nbe exchanged with a permanent implant either prior or after radiation\ntherapy.26; 49, level III\nA recent systematic review involving 1,565 two-stage implant-based\nreconstructive surgeries showed no significant difference in implant\nfailure rate between TE radiation and implant radiation.

Anti-HER2 therapy\nHER2 is overexpressed in 15 - 20% of breast cancer and is associated\nwith an aggressive clinical course of the disease.67 It is well-known that\npatients diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer need to be treated\nwith a combination of anti-HER2-directed therapy and chemotherapy in\nadjuvant setting. Evidence is emerging on its use in neoadjuvant setting\nas discussed below. In 2011, a pooled analysis of two RCTs in patients with pathologically\nconfirmed and untreated HER2-positive early breast cancer in\nneoadjuvant setting showed that the probability to achieve pCR was\nhigher in the combined trastuzumab and chemotherapy group than in\nchemotherapy alone (RR=2.07, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.46). The relapse free\nrate was also in favour of the combination arm (RR=0.67, 95% CI 0.48\nto 0.94).

Chemotherapy\nAdjuvant chemotherapy has an established role in eradicating\nmicrometastasis, thus improving survival.4 Generally, adjuvant\nchemotherapy is recommended for intermediate or high risk patients. In assessing absolute benefit of systemic adjuvant therapy, NICE\nrecommends the use of PREDICT tool, an online calculator, that\nis available from the UK NHS website. However, in local setting, a\nvalidation study of the tool concludes that while the tool is generally\naccurate, it needs to be used with caution in patients who are <40 years\nold and those who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.72\nTaxane-based chemotherapy are incorporated into the management\nof early and locally advanced breast cancer. Three meta-analyses\naddressed the effectiveness and safety of taxanes. In the first meta-analysis, taxane-based regimen improved DFS\n(OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.88) and OS (OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91)\ncompared with non-taxane-based regimen in non-MBC.

Familial breast cancer: classification, care and managing breast cancer and related risks\nin people with a family history of breast cancer. London: NICE; 2018\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\nRecommendation 31\n\u2022 Intensive screening of BRCA carriers and high risk individuals should\nbe vigilantly performed and adhered to recommended guidelines. \u2022 Screening of women with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 should be conducted from age 30 to 49 years\nwith both magnetic resonance imaging and mammography. Those\n50 years and above, screening with mammography should be done. 8.4.2 Risk-reducing strategies\ni) Risk-reducing surgery\n\u2022 Bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy\nRisk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) remains the most effective strategy\nfor reducing breast cancer risk. A meta-analysis showed that prophylactic\nbilateral mastectomy reduced the risk for breast cancer (RR=0.11, 95%\nCI 0.04 to 0.32) but not all-cause mortality.124, level II-2 Another systematic\nreview also showed 90 - 95% risk reduction.125, level II-2\nMultidisciplinary consultations are recommended prior to surgery and\nshould include discussions of the risks and benefits of surgery and\noption of breast reconstruction. Psychosocial effects of RRM should\nalso be addressed. For carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of PALB2, ATM\nand CHEK2, there is currently insufficient evidence for RRM and these\nindividuals are managed based on family history.25\n\u2022 Contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy\nCarriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 have increased risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. A prospective study showed average cumulative risks by age 70 years\nof 83% (95% CI 69 to 94) for BRCA1 and 62% (95% CI 44 to 79.5) for\nBRCA 2.126, level II-2 BRCA 1 particularly has higher risks as the majority\nof tumours would not receive endocrine therapy.127, level III Further risk\nfactors for contralateral breast cancer within BRCA carriers include\nearly age of first breast cancer diagnosis (<50 years) with increasing\nnumbers of first-degree relatives with breast cancer at a young\nage.127, level III; 128, level II-2\nContralateral risk-reducing mastectomy reduces risk of contralateral\nbreast cancer by over 90% in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers129, level II-2\nand is associated with 48 - 63% survival advantage.129 - 130, level II-2\nFor carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of PALB2, ATM\nand CHEK2, there is currently insufficient evidence for increased risk to\ncontralateral breast cancer. Management of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n\u2022 Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\nRisk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) remains the\nmost effective risk reduction strategy for the prevention of BRCA1-\nand BRCA2-associated ovarian, fallopian tube and peritonial cancers.", "chunk_order": 46}

A Cochrane systematic review of moderate quality primary papers\nshowed RRSO reduced risk of gynaecological cancers in both BRCA1\nand BRCA2.131, level II-2\nPre-menopausal high risk women are most likely to benefit from RRSO,\nbut also most likely to experience side effects from surgery, including\nloss of fertility, loss of sexual function and increased osteoporosis. Thus, RRSO is advised after completion of childbearing and from the\nage of 35 - 40 years old. Notably, whereas earlier meta-analyses suggested that RRSO\nmay reduce the risk of breast cancer, two recent studies presented\nstrong evidence suggesting that the previous reports may have been\nsubject to ascertainment bias. Correction for this bias suggested that\nRRSO provided no or minimal protective effect on breast cancer\nrisk.132 - 133, level II-2\nRecommendation 32\n\u2022 Risk-reducing surgeries should be discussed and offered to women\nwith pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes. ii) Chemoprevention\n\u2022 Selective estrogen receptor modulators\nA long-term RCT on tamoxifen as chemoprevention (20 mg for five\nyears) for moderate and high risk women (as determined using the\nTyrer Cuzick Model) found a reduction in the occurrence of all breast\ncancers in the tamoxifen group compared with placebo group (HR=0.71,\n95% CI 0.60 to 0.83). After 20 years of follow-up, the estimated risk of\ndeveloping all types of breast cancer was 12.3% (95% CI 10.1 to 14.5)\nin the placebo group compared with 7.8% (95% CI 6.9 to 9.0) in the\ntamoxifen group; hence the NNT for five years to prevent one breast\ncancer in the next 20 years was 22 (95% CI 19 to 26).134, level I\nA higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis in women receiving\ntamoxifen compared with placebo was seen in the first 10 years of\nfollow-up (OR=1.87, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.18). Although not significant,\nthere were more endometrial cancers in the tamoxifen group, but only\nfor the first five years of active treatment.134, level I\nWomen on tamoxifen should stop tamoxifen two months before trying\nto conceive or six weeks before elective surgery.5\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n\u2022 Aromatase inhibitors\nIn an RCT of anastrozole as chemoprevention in post-menopausal\nhigh risk women (as determined using the Tyrer Cuzick Model), after a\nmedian follow-up of five years, fewer women in the anastrozole group\ndeveloped breast cancer compared with placebo group (HR=0.47,\n95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). The predicted cumulative incidence of all breast\ncancers after seven years was 5.6% in the placebo group and 2.8% in\nthe anastrozole group, suggesting that 36 women (95% CI 33 to 44)\nwould need to be treated with anastrozole to prevent one cancer in\nseven years of follow-up.135, level I\nAnastrozole was not associated with an increased risk of other\ncancers particularly gynaecological cancers, nor any thromboembolic\nor vascular events.", "chunk_order": 47}

A contraindication for anastrozole use was severe\nosteoporosis.135, level I\n\u2022 Oral contraceptives\nFor female carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1\nor BRCA2, use of oral contraceptive could reduce the risk of ovarian\ncancer, with no significant increase in risk to breast cancer.118\n\u2022 In high risk women, evidence has shown that risk-reducing surgeries\nand chemoprevention are effective in reducing the risk of developing\nbreast cancers. 8.4.3 Role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA\ncarriers\nPoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (olaparib or\ntalazaparib) can be considered as a treatment option for patients with\nBRCA-associated advanced triple negative breast cancer or luminal\nmetastatic breast cancer, after failure of chemotherapy and endocrine\ntherapy. Its use is associated with a PFS benefit, improvement in quality\nof life and a favourable toxicity profile.63\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n9. FOLLOW-UP\nRegular follow-up visits are recommended every 3 - 4 months in the first\ntwo years, every 6 - 8 months from subsequent years 3 - 5 and annually\nthereafter. The interval of visits should be adapted to the risk of relapse\nand patients\u2019 needs. The recommended surveillance are.136\n\u2022 annual ipsilateral (after BCS) and/or a contralateral mammography\n(after mastectomy), with US and breast MRI when needed\n\u2022 regular bone density evaluation for patients on AIs or undergoing\novarian function suppression\n\u2022 encouragement towards adopting a healthy lifestyle, including diet\nmodification and exercise\nApproximately 5% of breast cancer patients will have a risk to develop\na new ipsilateral or contralateral cancer and it persists over time. There\nis limited evidence on surveillance strategies in older breast cancer\nsurvivors. The American Cancer Society has recommended screening\nmammography should be continued beyond 75 years old as long as\na woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or\nlonger.137 Nevertheless, current evidence is insufficient to assess the\nbalance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women\naged 75 years or older.138\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n10.

Some updates are done on\nPsychosocial Assessment and Intervention Section. a. Psychosocial assessment and intervention\nMost breast cancer patients experience at least some psychosocial\ndistress during the course of their diagnosis and treatment. A local study\nrevealed that up to 47.1% of women with breast cancer experience\npsychological distress, depression (25.3%), anxiety (18.8%)139 and\npost-traumatic stress disorder (19.6%).140\nOther common psychosocial concerns reported by women with breast\ncancer include:141\n\u2022 fear of recurrence\n\u2022 physical symptoms e.g. fatigue, sleep disturbance or pain\n\u2022 body image disruption\n\u2022 sexual dysfunction\n\u2022 treatment-related anxieties\n\u2022 intrusive thoughts about illness/persistent anxiety\n\u2022 marital/partner communication\n\u2022 feelings of vulnerability\n\u2022 existential concerns regarding mortality\nLocal studies showed that psychosocial issues impact patients\u2019\noverall well-being. In the currently challenging global economic state,\nalmost half of Malaysian families with cancer survivors experienced\nfinancial constraints.142 Other related issues include lack of constant\npsychosocial support and proclivity of undesirable consequences\ne.g. delaying treatment and/or not turning up for treatment at\nall.143; 144; 145; 146; 147; 148; 149; 150\nWomen with breast cancer should be screened for emotional distress\nusing validated self-assessment psychological tests by trained\nhealthcare providers.4 Psychological distress for them should be\nassessed at key time points throughout the cancer trajectory. This\nshould be done at diagnosis, during and after completion of treatment\nthroughout the survivorship period. Recommended screening tools for\nthis purpose include Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and Emotion\nThermometer (ET). While the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\nwas previously widely used, it is now copyrighted and requires payment\nto use. Management of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\nThe aim of a psychological intervention is to reduce emotional and\nmental burden as well as to equip patients with accurate information\nand psychological skills to manage their distress. The following\npsychosocial interventions should be offered by trained healthcare\nproviders particularly for women with emotionally vulnerability following\na diagnosis of breast cancer:4\n\u2022 cognitive behaviour therapy\n\u2022 psychosocial support\n\u2022 psycho-education programmes (e.g. printed materials, audiovisual materials, telephone support and counselling)\nOthers include Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully,151; 152\nMindfulness Therapy,153 and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.154\nb.

Lifestyle modifications\nLifestyle changes can be recommended to patients as an adjunct to\nstandard breast cancer treatment.156\nThe Malaysian breast cancer cohort study showed that there was a high\nproportion of breast cancer survivors being obese and overweight.148;\n157 Breast cancer survivors should have balance diet and maintain lean\nbody mass. There is still no particular style of diet that has been found to\nbe more beneficial for reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence.156\nHealthy lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of recurrence and this\nshould include:\n\u2022 achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through regular\nphysical activity and dietary modification; regular physical activity\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n(at least 150 minutes/week) has the most robust effect of all\nlifestyle factors on reducing breast cancer recurrence156\n\u2022 limiting alcohol intake to below five units per week (3 or 4 alcoholic\ndrinks per week or 6 g of alcohol per day)25\n\u2022 smoking cessation25\nd. Palliative care\nPalliative care aims to improve quality of life of patients and their families\nin facing the life-threatening illness by effective pain management and\nother distressing symptoms. It also incorporates psychosocial and\nspiritual care according to patient/family needs, values, beliefs and\ncultures.158 Palliative care is the main focus of care when cure is not\nachievable.26\nPalliative care begins at diagnosis of advanced breast cancer. It should\nbe delivered concurrently with disease-directed therapies and facilitate\npatient\u2019s autonomy on the further management based on the medical\ninformation. \u2022 Palliative care should be initiated by the primary care team and then\naugmented by a palliative care physician. Essential components of palliative care include the following:26\n\u2022 establishment of rapport and relationships with patients and family/\ncaregivers\n\u2022 management of symptoms, psychosocial/spiritual distress and\nfunctional status\n\u2022 exploration of patients\u2019 understanding and education about illness\nand prognosis\n\u2022 clarification of treatment goals\n\u2022 assessment and support of coping needs\n\u2022 assistance with medical decision making\n\u2022 coordination with other care providers\n\u2022 provision of referrals to other care providers as indicated\ne.", "chunk_order": 50}

Patient Navigation Programme\nPatient navigation programme (PNP) is a community-based service\ndelivery intervention designed to promote access to timely diagnosis\nand treatment of cancer and other chronic diseases by eliminating\nbarriers to care.159, level III\nPrinciples of PNP are:\n1. Navigation is a patient-centric healthcare service delivery model. 2. The core function of navigation is the elimination of barriers to\ntimely care across all levels of healthcare which is most effectively\ncarried out through a one-on-one relationship between the\nnavigator and the patient. Management of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n3. Patient navigation should be defined to distinguish the role and\nresponsibilities of the navigator from that of all other providers. Navigators should be integrated into the healthcare team in order\nto achieve maximum benefit for the individual patient. 4. Delivery of navigation services should be cost-effective and\ncommensurate with the training and skills necessary to navigate\nan individual through a particular phase of the care. 5. The determination of whom should navigate should be primarily\ndecided by the level of skills required at a given phase of navigation\nranging from trained lay investigators to professional providers. 6. There is a need to define the point where navigation begins and\nends; the need is not over until the cancer is resolved. 7. There is a need to navigate patients across disconnected level of\ncare i.e. from primary to tertiary care. 8. Navigation systems require coordination. In larger systems of\npatient care, the coordination is best carried out by assigning\na navigation coordinator or champion who is responsible for\noverseeing all phases of navigation activity within a given\nhealthcare level. PNP has the potential to reduce cancer-related disparities and improve\noutcomes by eliminating barriers to obtain quality cancer care. PNP\nin cancer care is effective in improving screening rates, adherence to\nfollow-up following an abnormal results and timeliness of diagnosis.159, level III\nMinimal research has indicated that PNP is effective for post-treatment\nsurveillance.160, level I\nMalaysia is one of the countries with lower relative survival rate in the\nAsia-Pacific, with only 66.8% of patients having 5-year survival rate,\nmainly due to late presentation and poor adherence to evidence-based\ntreatment.2, level II-2\nStudies in psychosocial factors show that fear, poor health education\nand lack of empowerment among Malaysians are major reasons\ncausing delay and defaulting treatment.", "chunk_order": 51}

BI-RADS\u00ae is designed to standardise breast imaging reporting\nand to reduce confusion in breast imaging interpretations. It also\nfacilitates outcome monitoring and quality assessment. It contains a lexicon for standardised terminology (descriptors) for\nmammography, breast US and MRI, as well as chapters on Report\nOrganisation and Guidance for use in daily practice. A. REPORT ORGANISATION\nA good reporting system should be concise and organised using the\nfollowing structure. THE STANDARD REPORTING SYSTEM:\nA statement indicating that the current examination has been compared\nto previous examination(s) should be included (specify date[s]). If this is\nnot included, it should be assumed that no comparison has been made,\nalthough it is preferable to indicate that no comparison was made. Below are the components of standard reporting system:\n1.", "chunk_order": 66}

Give management recommendations. 7. Communicate unexpected findings with the referring clinician. Management of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\nStandard Reporting\n6. Give recommendations on management\n7. Communicate unsuspected findings with the referring clinician\n1. Describe the indication for the study\nThe examination is for screening, diagnostic or follow-up. Mention\npatient\u2019s history. If US is performed, mention if it is targeted to a specific location or\nsupplementary screening. If an implant is present, both standard and\nimplant-displaced views should be performed and, this should be stated\nin the mammography report. 2. Describe the breast composition\nIn the BI-RADS 2003 edition, the assignment of the breast composition\nwas based on the overall density resulting in ACR category 1 (<25%\nfibroglandular tissue), category 2 (25 - 50%), category 3 (50 - 75%) and\ncategory 4 (>75%). In BI-RADS 2013, the use of percentages is discouraged because in\nindividual cases, it is more important to take into account the chance that\na mass can be obscured by fibroglandular tissue than the percentage of\nbreast density as an indicator for breast cancer risk. 1. Indication\n2. Breast\ncomposition\n3. Important\nfindings\n4. Comparison\nto previous\nstudies\nComposition: a-b-c-d\nMass Asymmetry\nArchitectural distortion\nCalcifications\nAssociated features\n5. Final assessment category\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\nIn the BI-RADS edition 2013, the assignment of\nthe breast composition is changed into a, b, c and\nd-categories followed by a description:\na- The breasts are almost entirely fatty. Mammography is highly sensitive in this setting. b- There are scattered areas of fibroglandular\ndensity. The term density describes the degree of x-ray\nattenuation of breast tissue but not discrete\nmammographic findings. c- The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which\nmay obscure small masses. Some areas in the breasts are sufficiently dense\nto obscure small masses. d- The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers\nthe sensitivity of mammography. Notice in the left example, the composition is c -\nheterogeneously dense, although the volume of\nfibroglandular tissue is less than 50%. The fibroglandular tissue in the upper part is\nsufficiently dense to obscure small masses. So, it is called c, because small masses can be\nobscured.", "chunk_order": 67}

Historically this would have been called an ACR 2:\n25 - 50% density. The example on the right has more than 50%\nglandular tissue and is also called composition c. 3. Describe any significant finding using standardized terminology\nUse the morphological descriptors: mass, asymmetry, architectural\ndistortion and calcifications. These findings may have associated features, like for instance a\nmass can be accompanied with skin thickening, nipple retraction,\ncalcifications, etc. Correlate these findings with the clinical information, mammography,\nUS or MRI. Integrate mammography and US findings in a single report. a. Mass:\nSize\nMorphology (shape, margin)\nDensity\nAssociated calcifications\nAssociated features\nLocation\nb.

Echogenicity can contribute to the assessment of a lesion, together\nwith other feature categories. Alone it has little specificity. \u2022 Posterior features: enhancement, shadowing. Posterior features represent the attenuation characteristics of a\nmass with respect to its acoustic transmission, also of additional\nvalue. Alone it has little specificity.

Intregrate the mammography and US\nfindings in a single report. 4. Comparison to previous examination(s), if deemed appropriate\nby the interpreting physician\nAwaiting to compare with previous examination may assume importance\nif the finding of concern requires an evaluation of change or stability. Comparison is not important when a finding has unequivocally benign\nfeatures. Comparison may be irrelevant when the finding is inherently\nsuspicious for malignancy.

Thus, healthcare providers must recognise and manage\nthe long-term sequelae of the constellation of therapeutic modalities. There is limited evidence for multidisciplinary rehabilitation among\nthese populations. A systematic review concluded that multidisciplinary\nrehabilitation was not harmful and may improve functional ability and\nquality of life in the short-term.1\n\u2022 Breast cancer-related lymphoedema\nBreast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is a common consequence\nof breast cancer treatment. Patient should be counselled on ways to\nprevent or reduce risk of lymphedema. Weight loss for those who are\noverweight or obese may reduce this risk.2,3 Good evidence showed\nthat there was no increased risk of BRCL with exercise; thus patient\nshould not restrict or avoid physical activity.4 Patients should be\nroutinely examined for clinical symptoms or swelling suggestive of\nlymphoedema. They should be referred to therapists knowledgeable\nabout the diagnosis and treatment of it. \u2022 Physiotherapist plays an important role in the rehabilitation care of\nwomen with breast cancer as well as the care of the survivors. \u2022 Late onset cardiotoxicity\nOccurrence of late onset cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy\nis generally low except for anthracycline especially if dose given is\nabove the limit. If occur, it typically presents as reduced left ventricular\nfunction failure. In contrast, trastuzumab cardiotoxicity usually occur\nduring treatment and does not have risk of delayed cardiotoxicity.5\nIdentification of high-risk patients including patients with pre-existing\nheart problems, cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and treatments like\ntrastuzumab and anthracyclines,6 education of patients on healthy\nlifestyle modifications, aggressive management of underlying CV\nrisk factors, consideration of cardioprotective strategies and, routine\nsurveillance of left ventricular function before and after therapies\nare recommended to reduce breast cancer treatment-associated\ncardiotoxicities.7 Aerobic exercise is considered a promising nonpharmacological strategy to prevent and/or treat chemotherapyinduced cardiotoxicity.5\nManagement of Breast Cancer (Third Edition)\n\u2022 Cognitive impairment\nCognitive impairment is one of the frequent complications reported\nby patients with breast cancer. All patients need to be screened for\ncognitive impairment and to identify reversible contributing factors e.g. organic brain disease, mood disorder, endocrine problem, dehydration,\ninfections or medication-related and optimally treat when possible. \u2022 Fatigue\nStudies of long-term cancer survivors suggested that approximately\none-quarter to one-third experienced persistent fatigue for up to 10\nyears after cancer diagnosis.8 Fatigue has a negative impact on work,\nsocial relationship, mood and daily activities. It causes impairment in\noverall quality of life during and after treatment. All patients should be\nassessed for fatigue and treated for any causative factors including\nanaemia, cardiac dysfunction, depression, sleep disturbance, etc. Patients without otherwise identifiable cause are encouraged to\nengage in regular physical activity and cognitive behavioural therapy\nas appropriate.", "chunk_order": 81}

Types of pain may be nociceptive, neuropathic\nor mixed pattern.9,10 Pain will lead to physical, emotional, spiritual and\nfunctional discomfort. Pain can be assessed with a comprehensive\nhistory taking and simple pain scales e.g. visual analog scale. Aetiology\nof the pain needs to be identified before initiation of treatment.
