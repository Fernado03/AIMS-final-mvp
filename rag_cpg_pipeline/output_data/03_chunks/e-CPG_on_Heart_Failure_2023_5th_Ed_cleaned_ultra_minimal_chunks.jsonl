It supersedes the previous CPGs on Heart Failure. STATEMENT OF INTENT\nPERIOD OF VALIDITY\nHeart failure is a condition associated with significant morbidity\nand mortality. In recent years, there have been advancements\nin both treatment and diagnostics, to enable all stakeholders in\nhealthcare to improve the management of this condition. Over 23 years have passed since the publication of the first\nClinical Practice Guidelines in Malaysia for Heart failure. Subsequent editions in 2007, 2014, and 2019 reflected the\ngrowing body of evidence generated both internationally and\nlocally. This latest edition incorporates the latest science in this\nfield. I am pleased to see that the goal of management has evolved, from reducing symptoms,\nimproving functional capacity, quality of life and patient survival, to reducing heart failure-\nrelated hospitalisation, and reducing the socio-economic impact. The paradigm shift is\ntimely to reduce the burden of hospital admissions due to heart failure. In addition, I can see new approaches to managing heart failure, including the introduction\nof early implementation and optimization of foundational heart failure medications, and a\nstructured, multidisciplinary strategy is essential to embark seamless care between\nhospitals and primary care. With 25 key messages and 22 key recommendations, I am sure these guidelines will provide\nall healthcare providers the necessary information that will lead to optimal care of patients\nwith heart failure in Malaysia.", "chunk_order": 0}

Heart\nFailure (HF), the end stage of most diseases of the heart, is a common medical problem\nencountered in primary care and is an important cause of hospital admissions and readmissions\nwith a significant impact on hospital expenditure. As the population ages, the prevalence of\nHF is expected to increase. The 1st Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) in HF was published in 2000 with revisions in\n2007, 2014 and 2019. Since then, there have been many new developments in this field. Thus, the publication of this 5th edition is timely. This CPG stresses on the early\nimplementation and optimization of the \u201cFoundational HF\u201d medications. It also proposes a\nstructured multidisciplinary strategy for the seamless care of patients with HF between\nhospital and primary care. This CPG was drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart Association of\nMalaysia and Ministry of Health. It comprises cardiologists, nephrologists, family medicine\nand general physicians and pharmacists from the government, private sectors, and the\npublic Universities. Objectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to:\n\uf06c Critically review the latest scientific evidence, since the last CPG, in the diagnosis and\nmanagement of HF. \uf06c Incorporate this new evidence in the daily management of our patients and adapt it to\nour local needs and available resources. \uf06c Develop clinical pathways for HF. \uf06c Establish HF Clinics and provide guidance on step down care of these patients within\nprimary healthcare. Process\nThe last CPG published in 2019 was used as a basis. Apart from addressing previous\nclinical questions that needed to be updated, the Expert Panel also formulated new\nquestions that needed to be addressed.", "chunk_order": 2}

Process\nThe last CPG published in 2019 was used as a basis. Apart from addressing previous\nclinical questions that needed to be updated, the Expert Panel also formulated new\nquestions that needed to be addressed. These clinical questions have been divided into\nsections and each member was assigned one or more topics. A review of current medical literature on HF from 1st Sept 2018 (the date of the last CPG) till\n31st August 2022 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases - PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.The following\nMedical Subject Headings ( MESH) terms or free text terms were used either singly or in\ncombination:\n\u201cHeart Failure\u201d, \u201cCongestive Cardiac Failure\u201d, \u201cAcute Heart Failure, \u201cChronic Heart Failure\u201d\n\u201cRight Heart Failure\u201d, \u201cLeft Heart Failure\u201d [MeSH], \u201cHeart Failure Reduced Left Ventricular\nFunction\u201d, Heart Failure Preserved Left Ventricular Function\u201d [MeSH], Acute decompensated heart failure, tachycardio-induced cardiomyopathy, heart failure mid-range, refractory\nheart failure, terminal heart failure, end stage heart failure, cardio-oncology\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans, and published in the\nEnglish language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge list. In\naddition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further\nstudies. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain further information. International\nguidelines on HF - the American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology and\nEuropean Society of Cardiology - were also studied. All literature retrieved was appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all statements\nand recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The grading of evidence\nand the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted from the American College\nof Cardiology / American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology\n(Page10). After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical Advisory\nCommittee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and key health\npersonnel in the major hospitals of the Ministry of Health and the private sector for review\nand feedback. Clinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated addressing the diagnosis and\ntherapy of HF. For diagnosis: In a person presenting with shortness of breath:\n\uf0d8 What features in the history and clinical examination would make one suspect this\npatient is having HF? \uf0d8 What diagnostic tests help confirm the clinical suspicion of HF with reasonable sensitivity\nand specificity?", "chunk_order": 3}

Target Group and Target Population:\nThis guideline is developed for all healthcare providers involved in the management of HF\nin individuals (> 18 years) with and at risk of HF. Facilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barrier for the successful implementation of this CPG is:\n1. The lack of knowledge of healthcare providers in the:\n\uf06c Diagnosis of HF. \uf06c Management of HF - initial treatment and long-term follow-up. \uf06c Optimization of therapy and when to refer to tertiary centers. 2. Availability of Natriuretic Peptide testing - BNP, NTProBNP - for early diagnosis of HF\nin Primary Health Care Clinics. 3. Availability of Foundational HF Medications in Primary Health Care Clinics (ARNI - Not\navailable, SGLT2- available in small quota and only for use in diabetic patients.)\nApplicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThese guidelines were developed considering our local health resources. Blood investigations,\nchest radiographs, ECGs and echocardiograms are common in almost all public health\nfacilities. Most of the drugs used to treat HF - diuretics, ACE-I, ARB, \u03b2-blockers have been\napproved for use in Malaysia and available in public hospitals as generics. This guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimize existing\nresources in the timely management of patients with HF. Implementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical governance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\uf06c Increasing public awareness of CVD and HF in general and educating them on the\nimportance of seeking early medical attention. \uf06c Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the implementation\nand optimization of the Foundational HF medications. This can be done by road shows,\nelectronic media, and in-house training sessions. \uf06c Clinical audit by individual hospitals and units to ensure compliance using the suggested\nperformance measures in Section 19, pages 160.", "chunk_order": 5}

With regards to etiology, it\nis more like HFrEF (high prevalence of CAD) but in terms of prognosis, it is like\nHFpEF. \uf06c In HFimpEF, patients have resolution of symptoms and signs of HF either spontaneously\nor with treatment, but HF is known to frequently relapse especially after withdrawal of\npharmacological treatment. These patients have a lower mortality and risk of hospitali\nzation compared to HFrEF and HFpEF. # 5: Etiology\n\uf06c The common underlying causes of HF in adults are:\n\uf0d8 Coronary artery disease (CAD) - accounting for almost 60-66% of HF in Malaysia. \uf0d8 Hypertension. \uf0d8 Dilated cardiomyopathy - idiopathic, familial. \uf0d8 Valvular heart disease - an important cause is rheumatic heart disease (RHD)\namong the rural and urban poor. \uf0d8 Diabetic cardiomyopathy. \uf06c Comorbidities are common and include hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. #6: Prevention of HF\n\uf06c Prevention and early intervention, wherever appropriate, should be the primary\nobjective of management. \uf06c There is robust clinical data that by appropriate and timely interventions, HF can be\nprevented, and cardiac function improved. \uf06c It should focus on those who are in:\n\uf0d8 Stage A - \u201cAt Risk\u201d - Individuals who are at high risk of developing cardiac disease\nbut who do not have symptoms or signs of HF and still have structurally normal hearts. \uf0d8 Stage B - \u201cPre HF\u201d - Individuals with structural cardiac disease and who have\neither normal or impaired cardiac function but do not, yet, have signs and symptoms\nof HF. # 7: Acute HF\n\uf06c Acute HF may present as:\n\uf0d8 De Novo HF - first occurrence of HF or,\n\uf0d8 Acute decompensated HF (ADHF) - this is a more common presentation occurring\nin a previously stable patient with HF who has now deteriorated. \uf06c Three important phases should be considered in the management of these patients. \uf0d8 Phase 1 - Urgent treatment and stabilization usually in the emergency department. \uf0d8 Phase 2 - In-hospital management. \uf0d8 Phase 3 - Discharge and Post discharge. # 8: Chronic HF due to LV reduced Function (HFrEF)\n\uf06c Optimal HF medications are:\n\uf0d8 Diuretics- to be titrated according to the presence of congestion. \uf0d8 Foundational HF medications:\n\uf077 Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers:\n\uf071 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or\n\uf071 Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or\n\uf071 Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI). \uf077 \u03b2-blockers. \uf077 Mineralocorticoid Antagonists (MRA). \uf077 Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i). \uf0d8 Other drugs (when necessary) include:\n\uf077 Ivabradine. \uf077 Nitrates.", "chunk_order": 11}

These include:\n\uf0d8 Atrial Fibrillation. \uf0d8 Ventricular arrhythmias. \uf0d8 Bradyarrhythmias. # 10: Surgery for HF\n\uf06c Patients with HF should undergo surgery if the pathology causing the HF (e.g., CAD,\nvalve lesions) is amenable to surgical treatment. #11: HFmrEF\n\uf06c HFmrEF includes symptomatic HF patients with LVEF between 41-49% and is a\nclinical entity between HFrEF and HFpEF. \uf06c There are a limited number of randomized control trials focusing on management of\nthis category of patients - most of the evidence is derived from post-hoc or sub-group\nanalysis of previous HF trials. #12: Chronic HF due to HFimpEF\n\uf06c HFimpEF includes patients with a:\n\uf0d8 Baseline LVEF of <40% and a\n\uf0d8 >10-point increase from baseline LVEF following treatment to\n\uf0d8 A second measure of LVEF > 40%. \uf06c LV function and structural abnormalities do not fully normalize despite improvement\nin symptoms, functional capacity, and near normalization of biomarkers. \uf06c Symptoms and signs may however relapse and cardiac biomarkers may increase if\nHF treatment is withdrawn. \uf06c Foundational HF medications should be continued to prevent relapse of symptoms\nand subsequent deterioration of LV function. #13: Chronic HF due to HFpEF\n\uf06c HFpEF is a heterogenous disease that is highly prevalent, accounting for up to 50%\nof all patients with HF and is becoming the dominant form of HF in aging populations\nworldwide. \uf06c In this guideline HFpEF refers to LVEF\u2265 50%.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Epidemiology of Heart Failure\nHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome and is the end stage of most heart diseases. Globally, it affects more than 60 million individuals and in Asia, the prevalence is estimated\nto be between 1.3% and 6.7%.1 In general, the incidence of HF has stabilized but the\nprevalence appears to be increasing due to the ageing of the population and increasing\nnumber of survivors post myocardial infarction.1-4\nIn Asia, patients with HF are younger with a mean age of 60 years and two-thirds are\n< 65 years.5 This is 10 to 15 years younger than patients in Europe (71-79 years) and the\nUSA (mean 72 years).6-10 Most of the Asian patients were males and about two-thirds (64%)\nhad 2 or more comorbid conditions such as hypertension (51.9%), coronary artery disease\n(CAD, 50.2%), or diabetes (40.4%).5 There were regional variations but Southeast Asians\n(Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Philippines) had the highest burden of\ncomorbidities, particularly CAD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and chronic kidney\ndisease.11\nIn the ASIAN-HF registry, the 1-year all-cause mortality for the whole population was 9.6%,\nvarying from 4.4% in Japan to 21.4% in Indonesia.11 Southeast Asians had the highest\nmortality (13.6%) compared with South Asians (8.3%) and Northeast Asians (8.9%).11\nIn Malaysia for Acute HF, (see Table 7, page 48), the:11-17\n\uf06c Median age of patients was 59-64 years. In Thailand, the mean age of patients with HF\nwas 65.3 years.34\n\uf06c Median length of hospital stay (LOS) was 3-5 days - comparable to that in the US.18\n\uf06c In-hospital mortality varied from <3% to as high as 7.5%. In the European Society of\nCardiology (ESC) HF-Long term (LT) registry, the in-hospital mortality was 4.9% and in\nthe Get With The Guidelines-HF (GWTG-HF) registry, the in-hospital mortality was <3%.18,19\n\uf06c 30-day mortality was high at 11-15%. \uf06c 1-year mortality was also similarly high at 33-49.5%.", "chunk_order": 30}

(Period\n1:1995-2005 vs period 2: 2006-2015).24 Improvement in all-cause mortality can be\nexplained partly by demographic differences and also by better utilization of Optimal\nMedical Therapy.25\n1.2 Socio-Economic Consequences of Heart Failure\nThe socio-economic burden of HF is huge. In high-income countries, 1-2% of the total\nhealthcare expenditure is spent on HF.21 In the US, total cost for HF was estimated to be\n$30.7 billion in 2012, with 68% attributable to direct medical costs.26 A more contemporary\nreview estimated annual healthcare costs for HF patients in the western world, to amount to\n25,000 Euro.1 Most of the costs was linked to inpatient care and re-hospitalizations. In\nMalaysia, in 2014, it was estimated that 3.6% of the GDP is being spent on total healthcare\nwith only 1.8% spent on HF.27 This cost is expected to rise with an ageing and rapidly\nexpanding population. The overall global economic cost of HF is highly variable from country to country.21,28 In\ngeneral, the costs of treatment of a HF patient is higher:28-30\n\uf06c than other diseases such as asthma, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndiseases, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. \uf06c in the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease. Healthcare costs for HF include:27\n\uf06c Direct costs - this accounts for 60% of total costs. \uf06c Indirect costs - account for 40%.", "chunk_order": 31}

Healthcare costs for HF include:27\n\uf06c Direct costs - this accounts for 60% of total costs. \uf06c Indirect costs - account for 40%. This includes premature mortality, \u2018presenteeism\u2019 (the\nlost productivity that occurs when employees are not fully functioning in the workplace\nbecause of an illness, injury, or other condition), disability, sick absenteeism (short- and\nmedium-term absence from work) and costs of caregiver's absenteeism. In general, in most low and medium economies like Malaysia, the indirect costs of HF in\nterms of premature mortality, morbidity, lost earning potential and unpaid care costs\noutweigh the direct costs.27\nIn Asia, there is substantial variations in healthcare spending. In a non-interventional,\nretrospective study conducted through medical chart audit for the year 2014, the average\ncost of HF hospitalization varied from USD 4,513 in Taiwan to USD 1,443 in public hospitals\nin Malaysia (adjusted to 2015 USD).31 This wide variation in costs could be partly explained\nby the fact that in Malaysia, healthcare is heavily subsidized by the government and the\nwide use of generic medications. There was also less use of more expensive medications\nsuch as Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitors and device therapy. In a costing study on HF conducted in Hospital Queen Elizabeth II, Kota Kinabalu, the mean\nand median annual cost of HF per person were USD 5,428 (MYR 22,649) and USD 591\n(MYR 2,466) respectively in 2017.32 This is much higher than that seen in the earlier study\nbecause it includes interventional procedures. Inpatient cost accounted for 90.6% of the\ntotal cost and was mainly attributable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\nprocedures and hospitalization.32\nIn another cost analysis done in 3 public hospitals in Sabah, Kelantan and Pulau Penang\nlooking only at patients with chronic HF from 2016-2018, the mean total cost per HF patient\nper-year (PPPY) was USD 1,971 (MYR 8,224) \u00b1 USD 1,255 (MYR 5,236), of which inpatient\ncost accounted for 74.7% of the total cost.33 Medication costs (42.0%) and procedure cost\n(40.8%) contributed to the largest proportion of outpatient and inpatient costs. HF patients\nwith preserved LVEF had the highest mean total cost of PPPY, at USD 2,410 (MYR 10,056)\n\u00b1 USD 1,226 (MYR 5,115).33\nThus, an important goal in management of HF is to prevent readmissions, reducing\nboth direct and indirect costs. 1.3 Humanistic Burden of Heart Failure\nA diagnosis of HF also has a huge humanistic burden.21,27 This refers to the impact of an\nillness on the patient\u2019s health-related quality of life (HRQoL), activities of daily living,\ncaregiver(s) \u2018s health, caregiver(s)\u2019s quality of life, patients\u2019 treatment satisfaction and\ncompliance with their specific treatment regimens.21,28 In general, most patients prefer\nimproved HRQoL to length of survival.", "chunk_order": 32}

The goals of management of HF include:\n\uf06c Preventing hospitalizations and unplanned hospital visits - this will reduce both the\nsocio-economic and humanistic burden of HF. \uf06c Reducing symptoms, improving functional capacity and quality of life, and thus improving\nthe humanistic burden of HF. \uf06c Improving patient survival. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to help health care providers in\nthe management of their patients with HF. Beyond the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG),\nclinical management needs to be individualized considering the patient\u2019s overall health\ngoals, values, perspective, and preferences. Sound clinical judgment plays an important role in formulating appropriate patient-centered\ncare plans. Key Message # 1: Epidemiology and Goals of Management\n\uf06c In Malaysia, patients with HF are almost 10-15 years younger than those in Western\nCountries. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease\nare common. \uf06c HF is associated with a huge socio-economic and humanistic burden. \uf06c Most of the costs related to HF are related to inpatient hospital care and\nre-hospitalizations. \uf06c Important goals of management include:\n\uf0d8 Preventing readmissions thus reducing both the socio-economic and humanistic\nburden of the disease. \uf0d8 Improving symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life. \uf0d8 Improving patient survival.

This is supported by either an elevation of natriuretic\npeptides and/or evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion.35\nThis may be accompanied by signs and symptoms of systemic hypoperfusion and/or\nvolume overload. Patients may have typical symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, ankle swelling\nand fatigue) and signs (e.g., elevated jugular venous pressure, ankle edema, pulmonary\ncrackles and displaced apex beat). Occasionally, some patients may present without signs\nor symptoms of volume overload. Older patients, often, present with atypical symptoms\nsuch as delirium, reduced appetite, immobility, incontinence, and falls. Most commonly, HF is due to myocardial dysfunction- either systolic, diastolic, or both. However, pathology of the valves, pericardium, and endocardium, and abnormalities of\nheart rhythm and conduction can also cause HF. Occasionally, non-cardiac disease, e.g., anemia, pulmonary, renal, thyroid, or hepatic\ndisease may have symptoms and signs like those of HF, but in the absence of cardiac\ndysfunction, these do not fulfil the criteria for HF. However, these pathologies can coexist\nwith HF and exacerbate the condition. 2. DEFINITION\nHF can be classified by phenotypes. These descriptions may reflect the:\n\uf06c Temporal characteristics (e.g., acuteness, chronicity)\n\uf06c Affected circulatory systems (e.g., left vs right)\n\uf06c Clinical context and trajectory (e.g., decompensated, improved, advanced, end-stage).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nThe main pathophysiology of HF is the inability of the heart to provide sufficient\ncardiac output to meet the perfusion and oxygenation requirements of the body while\nmaintaining normal filling pressures. This may be due to either impaired cardiac\ncontractility or impaired relaxation and compliance. Both mechanisms may co-exist in the\nsame patient and depending on the predominant pathophysiology, the patient may present\nas HFrEF or HFpEF. This will result in the following compensatory mechanisms:\n\uf06c A higher ventricular end diastolic pressure - This is a compensatory mechanism to\nincrease stroke volume by the Frank Starling mechanism. \uf06c Increasing ventricular volume and wall thickness through ventricular remodelling.", "chunk_order": 35}

In general, these neuro-hormonal responses are compensatory mechanisms. However they\ncan also aggravate HF by increasing ventricular afterload and increasing preload to the\npoint where pulmonary and/or systemic congestion and edema occur. 4.1 HFrEF\nIn HFrEF, cardiac output is reduced due to depressed myocardial contractility,\nirrespective of the etiology. This leads to a cascade of pathophysiological changes as\noutlined above. There are effective medical and device therapies that have been shown to\nhave a survival benefit in HFrEF. In this group of patients, their LVEF can remain as < 40%\nor improve to \u2265 40% when they are reclassified as Heart Failure with Improved Ejection\nFraction (HFimpEF). 4.2 HFpEF\nIn HFpEF there is impaired left ventricular (LV) filling due to decreased relaxation\n(during early diastole) and/or reduced compliance (early to late diastole) leading to\nelevated LV filling pressures at rest or during exercise. These hemodynamic changes are\naccompanied predominantly by signs of pulmonary and/or venous congestion and\noccasionally systemic hypoperfusion as well. Clinical studies seem to indicate that HFrEF and HFpEF are mechanistically distinct\npathophysiological entities.36 The transition from HFpEF to HFrEF is rare.37\nHFpEF appears to be a multi-organ, systemic syndrome with heterogeneous clinical\nmanifestations and high comorbidity burden.36\nThere is limited data available on therapies that improve survival in HFpEF unlike those with\nHFrEF. In this group of patients, their LVEF can deteriorate to between 41 to 49% (HFmrEF)\nor rarely < 40% (HFrEF). 4.3 HFmrEF\nThe prevalence of HFmrEF is between 10-25%.38 (Table 10, page 53). It is a clinical entity\nbetween HFrEF and HFpEF. With regards to etiology, it is more similar to HFrEF (high\nprevalence of CAD) but in terms of prognosis, they are more like HFpEF in terms of survival\nrates, low risk of CV events but a higher risk of non-CV adverse events than those with\nHFrEF.36,38,39\nHFmrEF represents a transitional phase and the LVEF can:\n\uf0d8 Remain in the 41 to 49% range (HFmrEF) or\n\uf0d8 Worsen to \u2264 40% (HFrEF) or\n\uf0d8 Improve to \u2265 50% (HFimpEF).", "chunk_order": 36}

Signs which are more specific for HF are an elevated jugular venous pulse (JVP), and a third\nheart sound. These signs are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with HF and\nasymptomatic LV dysfunction.46,47 The presence of a raised JVP, a positive jugulo-venous\nreflux and hepatomegaly generally indicate a raised right atrial pressure of > 8 mmHg.48 A\nraised JVP has a good sensitivity (70%) and specificity (79%) of left sided congestion.48\nA fourth heart sound is due to atrial contraction and is more frequent in patients with HFpEF. It is absent in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). These signs may be accompanied by a laterally displaced apical impulse and a cardiac\nmurmur. Other supportive signs include peripheral edema, tachycardia, narrow pulse\npressure, pulmonary crepitations, hepatomegaly and ascites. These clinical findings may be\ntransient and resolve completely following initial therapy. However, these signs are difficult to detect and are not always easily reproducible in the\nelderly, the obese and in patients with chronic lung disease. In a small study on patients with\nchronic HF, signs of congestion (rales, edema and JVP elevation) were absent in 42% of\npatients with a PCWP \u2265 22 mmHg.49 Occasionally symptoms and signs of volume overload\nmay be absent, and the patient may present with fatigue only. In the elderly, as exertional dyspnea increases, they begin to lead more sedentary lives. Fatigue is common and this is likely due to low cardiac output, peripheral hypo-perfusion\nand skeletal muscle deconditioning and should not be considered due to ageing only.50\nAtypical symptoms, such as confusion, memory deficit, sleepiness, episodes of delirium,\nirritability, syncopal states, fatigue, anorexia, and reduced level of activity are common\nmanifestations of HF especially after age 80.50 Other co-existing conditions such as\ninfections, anemia, delirium etc may complicate the clinical picture making the diagnosis of\nHF difficult.51 Bilateral leg edema is common in the elderly and may be due to other causes\nsuch as venous insufficiency, chronic kidney disease or lymphedema besides HF.51\nIn patients presenting with dyspnea, acute LV failure can sometimes mimic an acute\nexacerbation of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In\na trial on patients with HFpEF, however, HIIT did not confer any advantage compared to\nguideline based physical exercise.173\n\uf06c Inspiratory muscle muscle training (IMT) - the addition of IMT has been shown to reduce\ndyspnea, improve exercise time and HRQoL. 8.3 Diet and nutrition\nIt has been widely accepted that sodium intake should be restricted in patients with HF\nespecially in those with symptoms. However, there is little clinical evidence to support\nthis.174-176 Sodium restriction to < 100gm/day did not reduce clinical events.175\nThe current recommendation is to avoid adding salt and flavouring sauces such as\nsoya sauce, tomato ketchup and chilli sauce while cooking or at the table.

Fluid intake should be individualized. A general recommendation is 1-1.5 liters per day\nin patients with normal renal function. In older persons, particularly those living with dementia and at the end of life, fluid intake\nmay be more liberal. Temporary fluid restriction can be considered in decompensated heart failure and/or\npatients with hyponatremia.182\n8.2.1.5 Lifestyle measures\nThese include:\n\uf06c Weight Monitoring - Patients should be encouraged to monitor their own weight. In\nobese patients, weight loss should be encouraged.183\n\uf06c Alcohol - Heavy binge drinking should be avoided in patients with HF as it can predispose\nto supraventricular arrhythmias especially atrial fibrillation and lead to acute cardiac\ndecompensation.184.185 Patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy should abstain from\nalcohol.185\n\uf06c Smoking should be stopped.128,186\n8.2.1.6 Sexual activity, pregnancy, and contraception\nAs many as 60% to 87% of HF patients have sexual problems.187 Erectile dysfunction (ED)\nis common and many have misconceptions that their symptoms (20%) or medications\n(10%) is the cause.185 Proper counselling is necessary to address these concerns, to allay\nanxiety, avoid skipping medications and prevent the use of traditional potency enhancing\ndrugs or herbs.187\nIt is imperative that enquiries on sexual activities or dysfunction be addressed to\nprovide a holistic approach to patient care.188 The physician must take over the initial\napproach since patients are often embarrassed to initiate the topic.

Patients with LVEF < 30% and those with NYHA III and IV should be advised against\npregnancy because of high maternal mortality.191,192 If pregnant, termination of pregnancy\nshould be considered.192\nWhen pregnancy is contraindicated, a multi-disciplinary approach with pre-conception\ncounselling and proper contraceptive advice becomes paramount to the safety of the patient\nby preventing an unwanted pregnancy. Contraceptive counselling should begin early. In the\nabsence of randomized controlled studies, the choice of contraceptive method is almost\nalways based on expert opinion of the attending cardiologists, obstetrician, and the patient\u2019s\nchoice. Generally, Tier I methods which includes permanent sterilization and long-acting reversible\ncontraceptives such as intrauterine devices [IUDs] and implants, have typical-use 1-year\nfailure rates of < 1%. Given their excellent safety and efficacy profile, they should be\nrecommended for women with underlying CVD. The risk of infective endocarditis with IUD is\nlow.193,194\n8.2.1.7 Sleep disorders\nSleep disorders are common in HF with prevalence rates of 50-75%, the prevalence\nincreasing with age, obesity, male sex, Atrial Fibrillation, and poorer LV systolic function.195\nThese sleep disorders include short sleep time, low sleep quality, and sleep-disordered\nbreathing.196 Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) includes either:\n\uf06c Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) or\n\uf06c Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) or\n\uf06c Coexisting OSA and CSA. Sleep disturbances could also be due to pulmonary congestion leading to breathlessness\nand cough, and nocturnal diuresis due to diuretics and anxiety.

Alcohol\nand sedatives before sleep are best avoided.196 These patients are best managed in a\nmulti-disciplinary manner. CPAP improves daytime sleepiness. However, none of the evidence so far indicates\nan improvement in terms of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality or hospital\nadmissions.196,198-201\nIn patients with HF and CSA, the use of Adaptive Servo Ventilation (ASV) was associated\nwith an increase in all cause and CV mortality mainly driven by an increase in sudden\ncardiac death.137\nASV is contraindicated in patients with HF and CSA.135-140\nAs CSA tends to worsen when HF worsens, optimizing medical therapy remains the\nmain strategy in CSA.197\n8.2.1.8 Psychosocial support\nAbout 35% patients with HF have clinical depression and about 40% have severe\nanxiety.202,203 There is an association between HRQoL scores and survival.204 Most patients\nprefer improved HRQoL to longevity.205,206\nPatients with HF who have psychological problems have been shown to have increased\nmorbidity and hospital readmission rates, to be less adherent to their medical regimen, and\nto have an overall increase in cost of care. Effective, homebased HF management, has\nbeen shown to improve HRQoL, reduce expenditure and re-hospitalization rate.207,208\nThus, it is important that family members and carers are included during counselling\nsessions. Depressive symptoms may affect adherence and should prompt referral to the\nappropriate specialists for psychological support. Inpatient treatment and hospitalizations\nare the main drivers for a decrease of HRQoL and efforts should be made to avoid this.21\nl,C\nKey Recommendation # 3: Non-Pharmacological Measures\n\uf06c In managing HF, non-pharmacological measures play a vital role.

It may occur as:\n\uf06c De Novo HF - first occurrence of HF or,\n\uf06c Acute decompensated HF (ADHF) - this is a more common presentation occurring in\na previously stable patient with HF who has now deteriorated. In general, patients presenting with De Novo HF tend to do better than previously\nstable HF patients admitted with worsening symptoms ie ADHF.209,210 Patients admitted\nwith ADHF tend to have a greater comorbidity burden and are symptomatic despite being\non proven medical therapy.209\nWhen previously stable patients present with ADHF, their risk of death is increased.211 Only\none quarter to one third of these patients survive 5 years after a HF related hospitalization. Patients who have decompensated because of under or suboptimal treatment tend to do\nbetter when compared to those who have decompensated on OMT.212-214\nThe onset can be:215\n\uf06c Sudden with the patient presenting in acute respiratory distress and/or cardiogenic shock\n- This is a more common presentation of De Novo HF following an acute cardiac injury\ne.g., Acute MI or\n\uf06c As a slow progressive deterioration over days (up to weeks) prior to hospital\nadmission - this is a more common presentation of ADHF.

In 40% of patients admitted with Acute HF however, a clear underlying precipitant may not\nbe identified.217\n\uf06c Identify non-cardiovascular comorbidities - These can complicate management affecting\nthe choice and doses of medications used. The presence of these non-cardiovascular\ncomorbidities tends to worsen the prognosis. The more common comorbidities include:\n\uf0d8 Diabetes (Section 14.1)\n\uf0d8 Chronic kidney disease (Section 14.6)\n\uf0d8 Thyroid disease (Both hyper and hypothyroidism)\n\uf0d8 Chronic lung disease\n\uf0d8 Anemia\n\uf06c It is important that precipitating factors be identified as soon as possible after\npresentation and treated immediately according to guidelines. \uf06c The patient should be seen by a specialist as soon as possible after admission to\nco-ordinate the initial and further management.

Decision for hospitalization and care-setting\nInitial care in the critical care unit (ICU/CCU) should be considered for high-risk\npatients with features such as:\n\uf06c Hemodynamic instability. \uf06c Arrhythmias. \uf06c Hypoperfused state-cold peripheries, capillary refill time more than 2 seconds, diaphoresis,\noliguria, dizziness, confusion, narrow pulse pressure, hypotension. \uf06c Need for invasive ventilatory support. \uf06c Oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 90% despite supplemental oxygen. The remaining patients with Acute HF can be managed in a high-dependency unit or\nnormal ward depending on the clinical circumstances. However clinical deterioration may\noccur and hence, frequent re-assessments are necessary. Step-down care from the ICU/CCU is dictated by clinical improvement. Similarly, should the\npatient not improve, he should be considered to be transferred to a tertiary hospital with a\nCardiology Unit. 9.1.5. Response to Therapy\nResponse should be assessed continuously using the following parameters:\n\uf06c Symptoms and signs of HF - this requires repeated thorough clinical examinations\nlooking for resolution or worsening of clinical signs. \uf06c Vital signs\n\uf0d8 Oxygen saturation - SpO2. \uf0d8 Heart rate. \uf0d8 Blood pressure - including looking for a postural drop whenever possible. \uf0d8 Respiratory rate. l,C\nl,C\nl,C\nl,C\n\uf0d8 Urine output. \uf0d8 Body weight. \uf06c Investigations\n\uf0d8 Urea, creatinine, serum potassium and sodium. \uf0d8 Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be considered in patients if there are uncertainties\nin diagnosis, or, for the more severe cases, that despite pharmacological treatment,\npresent refractory symptoms (particularly with hypotension and hypoperfusion).

SGLT2-i has been shown to be effective irrespective of diabetic\nstatus.340-342 For these reasons, these 4 medications are referred to as \u201cFoundational\nHF\u201d Medications. \uf06c The initiation and up titration of these 4 Foundational drug classes should be guided by\nthe patient\u2019s:\n\uf0d8 Clinical status,\n\uf0d8 Heart rate,\n\uf0d8 Blood pressure,\n\uf0d8 Fluid overload status,\n\uf0d8 Renal function,\n\uf0d8 Electrolytes and\n\uf0d8 Tolerance. \uf06c Comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, chronic kidney, and pulmonary disease\nare also important conditions to be considered. \uf06c These 4 Foundational HF Medications should be initiated at about the same time and\nup titrated if needed to their target or maximally tolerated doses. \uf0d8 In general, starting low doses of the 4 different classes would be preferred over up\ntitration of each of the individual drugs to the maximally tolerated dose before initiating\nthe next drug. \uf0d8 These drugs are preferably all initiated, albeit at low doses, when the patient is\nadmitted with HF so that at the time of discharge, the patient is on all the \u201cFoundational\nHF\u201d Medications. \uf06c These drugs should be \u201cup titrated\u201d as outpatient to the maximally tolerated dose\naccording to the patient\u2019s profile - hemodynamic and renal function.

Euvolemia is, however, often difficult to assess clinically. Important features to look for\nclinically are:345\n\uf0d8 Resolution of symptoms and signs of congestion - subclinical congestion is sometimes,\nhowever, difficult to detect. \uf0d8 Improvement in effort tolerance and walking distance. \uf06c Other useful investigative tools which may be helpful to assess euvolemia, if available,\ninclude:\n\uf0d8 Chest X-ray - this is a specific but not a very sensitive indicator of volume status.346,347\n\uf0d8 Echocardiographic parameters - such as:\n\uf077 Decrease in chamber sizes. \uf077 Decrease in the diameter of the IVC and a 50% decrease with inspiration. \uf077 Normalization or at least a decrease in doppler indices of LV and RV filling pressures. \uf0d8 Natriuretic peptides - These may, however, be persistently elevated in patients with\nChronic HF and in addition, there is biological variability. A decrease in levels compared\nto admission would be a helpful guide although relying on this alone can lead to a false\nassurance that decongestion has been achieved.48\n\uf0d8 Lung ultrasound (LUS) - In a small study, tailored LUS-guided diuretic treatment of\npulmonary congestion reduced the number of decompensations and improved walking\ncapacity in patients with HF.348\n\uf06c Most of these investigative tools-such as echocardiographic parameters and natriuretic\npeptides - measure filling pressures and not volume status. These tests, however, may\nsometimes be insufficient to detect subclinical volume excess without accompanying\nincreases in filling pressures.349\n\uf06c The dose of diuretic used is variable and dependent on individual requirements. In the\npresence of:\n\uf0d8 Severe congestive HF and ADHF, oral diuretic therapy may be ineffective. Intravenous\ntherapy may be preferred. The diuretic of choice in these patients with fluid overload\nis a loop diuretic i.e., furosemide. The goal is a reduction of body weight of about\n1kg/day. \uf0d8 Mild fluid retention, thiazide diuretics may be preferred especially in the presence\nof co-existing hypertension.

It has been shown to decrease CV death, HF\nhospitalizations, and symptoms.335 The benefit of ARNI over an ACE-I, was consistent\nI,A\nIIa,B\nI,A\nI,B\nI,B\nIII,A\nregardless of background therapy and irrespective of previous coronary revascularization\nor \u03b2-blocker dose.366 It has also been shown to have favorable effects on cardiac remodeling.367\n\uf06c ARNI may also be considered as a first-line RAS blocker in ACE-I-na\u00efve patients.315\n\uf06c ARNI in Post MI patients with LVEF <40% was not superior to the ACE-I ramipril.368\n\uf06c The tolerability of ARNI and its side effect profile is like that of ACE-I or ARB. Laboratory\nmonitoring is also similar. \uf06c The use of ARNI is, however, associated with hypotension but a low incidence of\nangioedema. \uf06c When initiating an ARNI, the initial dosing and rate of titration:\n\uf0d8 Is dependent on pre-existing treatment, hemodynamic profile, and associated comorbidities. It should be individualized. \uf0d8 Should not be initiated if systolic BP < 100mmHg and used with caution if eGFR\n< 30 mL/min/1.73m2. \uf0d8 When switching from ACEI to ARNI, a washout period of at least 36 hours is required\nto decrease the risk of angioedema. \uf0d8 No washout period is required for conversion between ARB and ARNI.", "chunk_order": 74}

The decision to subject a patient to surgery should however consider the\nfunctional status, prognosis, and comorbid conditions of the patient. Surgical procedures include the following:\n10.4.1. Revascularization Procedures\nPatients with CAD and HF may benefit from revascularization particularly if they have\nangina and anatomy that is suitable for revascularization (left main stem or triple vessel\ndisease). The benefit of revascularization is likely to be more in younger patients with more\nsevere left ventricular dysfunction, severe CAD with angina, viable myocardium, and reversible\nischemia. The STICH trial did not find any difference in survival between optimal medical therapy and\nCABG in patients with CAD amenable to surgery and LVEF < 35% at the end of the trial at\na median follow up of 56 months.499 An extended follow up of the trial, however, after a\nmedian follow-up of 9.8 years, found lower total mortality, CV death and the combined\noutcome of all cause death and CV hospitalizations in patients with severe HF (LVEF <\n35%) who underwent CABG.500 There was an early risk of mortality following CABG, but the\nbenefits of CABG were seen after 2 years, and these were seen whether myocardial viability\nor angina was present or absent. Coronary revascularization by CABG should be considered in patients with HF and suitable\ncoronary anatomy. A recently completed trial comparing PCI to OMT in patients with demonstrable myocardial\nviability and LVEF< 35% did not result in an improvement in CV outcomes.501\nThese high-risk patients undergoing CABG have a high surgical morbidity with longer\nintensive care unit stays, a median in-hospital stay of 9.0 days and higher 30-day mortality.499\nThe treatment decision should be individualized after a discussion with the patient and\nfamily and considering the recommendations of the Heart Team.", "chunk_order": 87}

It is\nhowever expensive and is associated with significant adverse events.507-509\nPatients awaiting heart transplant who have become refractory to medical therapy and\nrequiring inotropic support should be considered for a mechanical support device as a\nbridge to transplant.507-509\nKey Messages # 10: Surgery for HF\n\uf06c Patients with HF should undergo surgery if the pathology causing the HF is amenable\nto surgical treatment. \uf06c This is particularly so if they have ischemia demonstrated as angina or by non- invasive\ntesting and an anatomy that is suitable for revascularization (left main stem or triple\nvessel disease). \uf06c The decision to subject a patient to surgery should however consider the functional\nstatus, prognosis, and comorbid conditions of the patient.

CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - HF DUE TO PRESERVED LV SYSTOLIC\nFUNCTION, LVEF > 50% - (HFpEF)\nHFpEF is a heterogenous disease with various phenotypes and comorbidities.521-524 It is\nhighly prevalent, accounting for up to 50% of all patients with HF and is becoming the\ndominant form of HF in aging populations worldwide.525,526\nIn this guideline HFpEF refer to LVEF \u2265 50%. Importantly, clinicians should be aware that\nLVEF is a continuous variable and the EF cut-offs used in definitions are therefore\narbitrary.155,527,528\nHFpEF differs from HFrEF in that HFpEF patients are older and more often female. AF,\nCKD, and non-CV comorbidities are more common in patients with HFpEF than in those\nwith HFrEF.529\nIn the ASIAN-HF registry, patients with HFpEF were younger and leaner. They, however,\ncarried a high comorbidity burden, with 70% of patients having a least two comorbidities\n-most commonly hypertension, followed by anemia, CKD, diabetes, ischemic heart disease\n(IHD), AF, and obesity.525 Similarly in the MyHF registry, patients with HPpEF had a high\ncomorbidity burden, commonly hypertension, diabetes, IHD and CKD.530\n13.1. Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging as symptoms and signs can be attributable to other\nco-existing conditions and LVEF is normal. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\nobesity per se can also contribute to dyspnea in these patients. The main hemodynamic finding in HFpEF is an elevation in LV filling pressures i.e. end\ndiastolic LV pressure (LVEDP). In the early stages of the disease, these become elevated\nonly during exercise or exertion giving rise to exertional shortness of breath.531 As the\ndisease progresses, it becomes elevated even at rest. As outlined previously, the definition of HF includes the presence of:\n\uf06c Clinical symptoms and signs of HF and\n\uf06c Raised NP - In general, the level of elevation of these peptides are less than that seen in\npatients with HFrEF.532 NP levels may be normal in patients with HFpEF who are obese\nand falsely raised in patients without HFpEF but with AF.533-535 Thus the diagnosis of\nHFpEF cannot be relied on solely on elevated NP levels.", "chunk_order": 90}

Key Recommendations #10: Chronic HF due to HFimpEF\n\uf06c Symptoms and signs may relapse, and cardiac biomarkers may increase if HF\ntreatment is withdrawn. \uf06c Foundational HF medications should be continued to prevent relapse of symptoms\nand subsequent deterioration of LV function. If the patient has HF as per above definition, then basic investigations should be performed\nas outlined previously to look for possible etiology and the presence of comorbidities:\n\uf06c ECG\n\uf06c Chest X-ray\n\uf06c Lab investigations\n\uf06c Echocardiogram - Some features supporting the diagnosis of HFpEF include:536\n\uf0d8 LVEF \u2265 50% within 72 hours of the clinical event. \uf0d8 Left ventricular hypertrophy (increased LV wall thickness or LV mass index > 115g/m2\nfor men and > 95g/m2 for women). \uf0d8 Left atrial enlargement (LA volume index > 34ml/m2 or > 40 mL/m2 in the presence of AF). \uf0d8 Diastolic dysfunction if E/e\u2032 \u2265 15.536 A mean E/e\u2019 index >15 at rest has good diagnostic\nvalue for identifying a high mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mPCWP),\nsupporting the likelihood of HFpEF but an E/e\u2019 ratio within the intermediate range\n(9-14) is less sensitive. The E/e\u2019 index cannot be recommended as a single diagnostic\nindex above all other non-invasive measures of filling pressures (such as retrograde\npulmonary venous flow).536\n\uf0d8 Tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity > 2.8m/s. HFpEF may be suspected in patients who have dyspnea and in whom non-cardiac causes\nof breathlessness have been excluded. In addition, the:\n\uf06c The LVEF > 50% and\n\uf06c There is no significant heart valve disease or cardiac ischemia. Many patients who are elderly, obese and who have hypertension, diabetes and/or AF\npresenting with dyspnea would fall into this category. The diagnosis of HFpEF is often not clear cut. It does not depend on a single parameter but\non a combination of parameters derived from clinical presentation, laboratory results and\nimaging tests that together will give a probability for the diagnosis.536,537\nIn difficult diagnostic situations, 2 scores have been proposed to aid in the initial assessment\nof patients suspected of having HFpEF (Appendix VI & VII, page 167-168)\n\uf06c H2FPEF score538\n\uf06c HFA-PEFF score536\nIn cases of intermediate probability of the disease based on the scores, confirmatory tests\nsuch as exercise echocardiography, invasive measurement of intracardiac pressures i.e. the mPCWP at rest and sometimes with exercise is necessary to make the diagnosis.

Lorem ipsum\n13.2. Etiology and Associated Comorbidities\n\uf06c HFpEF may also share similar clinical characteristics with valvular heart disease, pericardial\ndisease, and high-output HF. In all these conditions, patients present with HF and have\nnormal LVEF and even normal LV dimensions. In HFpEF however, the HF is due to\nmyocardial disease resulting in abnormal myocardial relaxation, decreased compliance,\nand increased filling pressure.539 For this reason, a basic echocardiogram is essential in\nthe initial work up of these patients. \uf06c The etiological factors affecting HFpEF and HFrEF seem to be different. When compared\nto patients with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF are more likely to have hypertension,\nvalvular heart disease (e.g., aortic stenosis) and AF and are less likely to have a MI or left\nbundle branch block.540\n\uf06c Comorbidities play an important role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF. These contribute\nto systemic and endomyocardial inflammation with fibrosis which are important in the\npathogenesis of the disease.524 It is these comorbidities that primarily correlate with\noutcome in patients with HFpEF rather than NP levels or echocardiographic parameters.541\n\uf0d8 Hypertension remains the most prevalent comorbidity of HFpEF, with a prevalence of\n60% to 89%.542-544\n\uf0d8 Other comorbidities include :542-544\n\uf077 Overweight or obesity- Obesity is not only a comorbidity, but it is also an important\nrisk factor for HFpEF development. The mechanisms involved are complex and\ninclude neurohormonal mechanisms and oxidative stress.545 Morbid obesity also has\nan adverse effect on cardiac remodeling.545\n\uf077 Diabetes mellitus (DM)\n\uf077 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n\uf077 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n\uf077 Anemia\n\uf077 Coronary artery disease (CAD)\n\uf077 Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n\uf0d8 The presence of diabetes, a lower systolic BP, lower hemoglobin and a lower eGFR\nwere associated with a poorer outcome.541\n\uf0d8 AF is common in HFpEF and increases the risk of adverse outcomes.546\n13.3 Management (Table 6, page 44)\nCompared with HFrEF patients, hospitalizations, and deaths in patients with HFpEF are\nmore likely to be due to non-cardiovascular causes. As LVEF increases, the proportional\ncontribution of non-cardiac and non-HF events to death or hospitalization increases,\nhighlighting the importance of managing comorbidities. The important aim of therapy is to alleviate symptoms, improve well-being and reduce\nhospitalizations.

It is an important CV complication and\nthe prognosis of diabetic patients admitted to hospital for HF were worse than those\nadmitted with MI.582,583\n\uf06c The prevalence of HF ranges between 4-30% in various diabetic drug trials, with almost\na third of patients being undiagnosed.584\n\uf06c Even pre-diabetics (depending on the definition used) have a 9-58% risk of developing\nHF.585 It is often the first manifestation of a CV event.571\n\uf06c Predictors for the development of HF in patients with DM include:571,586-589\n\uf0d8 Female sex\n\uf0d8 Longer duration of DM\n\uf0d8 Older age\n\uf0d8 Increased body mass index\n\uf0d8 Poorer glycemic control\n\uf0d8 Insulin use\n\uf0d8 Renal impairment\n14.1.3.", "chunk_order": 96}

VALVULAR HEART DISEASE (VHD) AND HF\n14.2.1. Etiology\nCommon etiological factors are:\n\uf06c Rheumatic Carditis and Rheumatic Heart disease (RHD)\n\uf0d8 In a patient with acute rheumatic carditis, the early detection and appropriate treatment\nof beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections of the pharynx (positive throat swab and\nraised ASOT) during the infection and with subsequent appropriate penicillin prophylaxis\nagainst recurrent infection will help prevent the development of RHD in later life. \uf0d8 RHD is a sequela of acute rheumatic carditis. It occurs because of inflammation and\nscarring of the heart valves leading to fusion of the commissures and/or fusion and\nshortening of the chordae and deformation of the valve cusps. The incidence of\nRheumatic Fever and RHD is still high among the rural and urban poor.640\n\uf06c Infective Endocarditis\n\uf0d8 This can result in acute valvular damage or may exacerbate an underlying valve pathology. \uf0d8 A common source is poor oral hygiene. \uf0d8 An often-unrecognized source is i.v. lines. \uf06c Congenital\n\uf0d8 This includes congenital bicuspid aortic valves, congenital mitral valve prolapse\n(Barlow\u2019s disease) and pulmonary stenosis. \uf06c Degenerative disease\n\uf0d8 Commonest cause in the elderly. \uf0d8 This includes calcific aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation secondary to aortic root\ndilatation from any cause, and degenerative mitral regurgitation. 14.2.2. Valve pathology\n\uf06c Mitral Valve Disease\n\uf0d8 Mitral stenosis (MS)\n\uf077 This is almost always due to RHD. \uf0d8 Mitral Regurgitation\n\uf077 Primary mitral regurgitation is a disease of the mitral valve leaflets or chordae. It is\nthe most common primary VHD seen locally. \u00ba In young adults and middle-aged persons, it is commonly due to RHD. It may also\nbe secondary to collagen disorders such as Marfan\u2019s. \u00ba In the older age group (>70 years of age), degenerative causes leading to\nfibroelastic deficiency, myxomatous degeneration, chordal elongation and rupture\nare more common. \uf077 Secondary mitral regurgitation also known as functional MR, is a consequence of LV\ndysfunction with normal mitral valve leaflets and chordae. The LV dilatation may be\nsecondary to CAD or any other non-ischemic etiology. \uf06c Aortic Valve Disease\n\uf0d8 Aortic stenosis (AS)\n\uf077 May occur due to congenital bicuspid aortic valve.", "chunk_order": 101}

History and Physical Examination\n\uf06c Common presenting symptoms are dyspnea, reduced effort tolerance and palpitations. \uf0d8 The presence of symptoms of HF in a stenotic lesion is a strong indication for intervention. \uf0d8 In regurgitant lesions, particularly with aortic regurgitation, it is usually a late presentation. \uf06c The presence of valvular AF indicates significant valve pathology - usually due to mitral\nvalve disease. 14.2.4. Investigations\nEssential investigations include:\n\uf06c ECG\n\uf06c Chest Radiograph - Chest X-rays\n\uf06c Echocardiography -\n\uf0d8 Transthoracic echocardiography is usually adequate to make the diagnosis and plan\nmanagement. \uf0d8 Transesophageal echocardiography may be required if the transthoracic echocardiography\nis of suboptimal quality or occasionally for prosthetic valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve\nendocarditis or left atrial thrombi. It is also necessary preoperatively when detailed\nvalve anatomy is required to assess valve repairability. 14.2.5. Management\nAll patients with VHD should be assessed periodically on the need for early intervention\nbefore they begin to develop symptoms of reduced effort tolerance and decompensate. This\ncan be achieved by:\n\uf06c Serial Chest X-rays to look for progressive cardiac enlargement. \uf06c Serial echocardiograms are more sensitive to look for progressive deterioration. It can\nassess valve severity, chamber dilatation, pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac (both\nLV and RV) function. \uf06c Objective assessment of the patient\u2019s effort tolerance and symptoms in doubtful cases. Patients with VHD who are assessed to require intervention should be seen by a heart\nteam to help decide the timing and type of intervention.641 Valve intervention include:\n\uf06c Surgical repair or valve replacement. \uf06c Percutaneous intervention. The initial medical management of patients with VHD and HF (especially those with secondary\nmitral regurgitation) is as outlined earlier with the Foundational HF medications. In addition,\n\uf06c Vasodilators should be avoided in severe valve stenosis. \uf06c Atrial Fibrillation should be managed with:\n\uf0d8 Rate control using:\n\uf077 \u03b2-blockers and/or\n\uf077 Digoxin for rate control\n\uf0d8 Anticoagulation with DOAC or vitamin K antagonists to prevent thrombo-embolism. 14.2.5.1.

Where applicable, genetic testing and family screening should be considered. 14.3.1 Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)\n\uf06c DCM is one of the leading causes of HFrEF globally.662\n\uf06c It is characterized by systolic dysfunction and ventricular dilatation in the absence of\nabnormal loading conditions (e.g., hypertension, valvular stenosis) or CAD659. Other\nmorphological changes include atrial dilatation, reduction in ventricular wall thickness,\nand functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. \uf06c The etiologies are myriad but can generally be classified into genetic or non-genetic\ncauses (Appendix VIII, page 169). In some circumstances these causes can overlap and\ninteract with one another e.g., cardiotoxicity from chemotherapeutic agents in a patient\npredisposed genetically to DCM. \uf06c A family history can be detected in 30-50% of cases663 and a genetic determinant in up\nto 40% of DCM patients.659,664 More than 60 genes coding for various myocardial\nproteins and molecules have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DCM.664,665 The most\ncommon inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant. \uf06c The clinical course of DCM is variable, but it generally follows of one these pathways666:\n\uf0d8 Recovery following incident HF. \uf0d8 Remission with improvement or stabilization of LV systolic function. \uf0d8 Progression to advanced HF and death. \uf06c Reverse remodeling is usually observed in DCM resulting from potentially reversible\ncauses such as alcohol-related cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy and\ntachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. 14.3.1.1. Management\n\uf06c Management of dilated cardiomyopathy is as outlined in the earlier sections with the\nFoundational HF Medications. 14.3.2. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n\uf06c HCM accounts for 2-3% of HF667. Etiologies of HCM are shown in (Appendix VIII, page 179-180)\n\uf06c It is characterized by an increase in LV wall thickness (commonly defined as >15 mm, or\n>13 mm in adult first degree relatives of HCM patients) in one or more myocardial\nsegments which cannot be explained by abnormal loading conditions.668,669\n\uf06c The predominant form of HF in HCM is HFpEF.

CARDIOMYOPATHY DUE TO ARRHYTHMIAS OR CONDUCTION\nABNORMALITIES\n14.4.1 Arrhythmia Induced Cardiomyopathy\nArrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AiCM) includes:687,688\n\uf06c Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. \uf06c Atrial Fibrillation (AF) induced cardiomyopathy. \uf06c Premature Ventricular Complexes (PVC) induced cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmia-induced Cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of HF characterized by LV\ndysfunction resulting from an increased ventricular rate. The degree of LV dysfunction\ncorrelates with the duration as well as rate of the tachyarrhythmia. The cardiomyopathy\nmay present weeks, months, or years after the onset of the tachycardia.687,689 It can occur\nin the setting of either an incessant or paroxysmal tachycardia and it should be suspected if\nno other cause of LV dysfunction is identified.687\nRecognition of this entity is important clinically, as treatment of the underlying arrhythmia\ncan result in either partial or complete recovery of LV function which, in turn, would result in\nan improvement in morbidity and mortality.687\nIn managing arrhythmias in patients with HF:\n\uf06c Initiate the \u201cFoundational HF\u201d Medications to improve LV function and optimize reverse\nLV remodeling. \uf06c Identify and treat arrhythmias accordingly. Arrhythmia recognition and suppression\nshould be considered as part of the holistic evaluation and management of HF. \uf06c Treat non cardiovascular comorbidities particularly, lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea\nand obesity. 14.4.1.1. Detection of Arrhythmias\nArrhythmias are sometimes difficult to detect, especially if they are paroxysmal and\ninfrequent. In any person who presents with a deterioration in cardiac function, paroxysmal\npalpitations, near faints or syncope and the clinical suspicion that these could possibly be\ndue to arrhythmias are high, the following modalities may be considered to aid in the diagnosis:\n\uf06c Prolonged ECG rhythm monitoring using 3-day, 7-day or even 1- month rhythm monitors. \uf06c Using a watch that can monitor ECG heart rhythm or\n\uf06c An implantable loop recorder. 14.4.1.2. Supraventricular Arrhythmias\nAny supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a rapid ventricular response may induce HF. Commonly encountered SVTs in clinical practice include:\n\uf06c Incessant atrial tachycardia (AT),\n\uf06c Very frequent episodes of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and\n\uf06c Atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT).", "chunk_order": 107}

Most anti-arrhythmic drugs\nare however contraindicated in the presence of HF. \uf06c Catheter ablation - This has a higher chance of achieving rhythm control in patients with\nAF than anti-arrhythmic drugs.437 Catheter ablation has been shown to reduce the risk of\ndeath and HF hospitalization in patients with AF and HF when compared to standard\ntherapy with anti-arrhythmic drugs.692,693 The success of the procedure and benefits seen\nwere more likely in patients who underwent the procedure within 1 year of diagnosing AF.692\n14.4.1.4. Ventricular Arrhythmias\nVentricular arrhythmias, including frequent PVCs or VT, may also induce HF.689 It is however,\nsometimes difficult to ascertain whether the PVCs caused LV dysfunction or whether\nprogressive LV dysfunction caused the frequent PVCs.694,695 Even if the PVCs are the result\nof LV dysfunction, if frequent, may contribute to and increase the risk of HF and mortality\neven after adjusting for age and other ECG abnormalities.689\nThus, maintenance of sinus rhythm and/ or control of ventricular rate is important in treating\npatients with HF.689,694,695\nPVC induced cardiomyopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion, to be suspected in patients with\nfrequent PVCs > 10%, especially in the nonischemic setting. Generally, LV dysfunction has\nbeen associated with greater PVC burden (>10% and usually > 20%).694\nCurative or suppressive therapies with either radiofrequency ablation or anti-arrhythmic\ndrugs may be considered in patients with PVC burden of:\n\uf06c > 10% over 24 hours (high) - The prevalence of PVC induced cardiomyopathy in this group\nof patients has been reported to be about 7% but this could be an underestimate.687,696\n\uf06c > 20% over 24 hours (very high) - The exact prevalence in this group is not known.694,696,697\nIn patients with cardiomyopathy suspected to be caused by frequent and predominately\nmonomorphic PVCs, catheter ablation is recommended.", "chunk_order": 108}

HEART FAILURE AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)\n14.6.1. Epidemiology, definitions, and classifications\nHF and CKD frequently co-exist. The presence of both at the time of admission for HF,\nvaries from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with Acute HF.734,735\nIn addition, during treatment of acute HF, a significant proportion of patients will develop\nvarying degrees of worsening renal function. The definition of worsening renal function is:219\n\uf06c An increase in serum creatinine by \u2265 26.5\u03bcmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n\uf06c A \u2265 25% increase in serum creatinine or a \u2265 20% drop in eGFR. The rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of hospitalization. The incidence of worsening renal function is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.736 This\nlarge observed range is due to variations in the definitions of worsening renal function, the\nobserved time-at-risk, and the study population.736\nRisk factors for worsening renal function during admission for HF include:737\n\uf06c A prior history of HF or diabetes and/or\n\uf06c An admission serum creatinine of > 133\u03bcmol/L and/or\n\uf06c Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg.

Worsening renal function may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term \u201ccardiorenal syndrome\u201d refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute\nor chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic impairment of the other.736\nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into\n5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, page 133.736 Many patients, however, may belong to more\nthan one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.736\n14.6.2. Pathogenesis of Cardio-Renal Syndrome (CRS)\nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n\uf06c Increased renal venous pressure - venous congestion is probably the most important factor.738\n\uf06c Right ventricular dysfunction. \uf06c Reduced renal perfusion due to reduced cardiac output. \uf06c Volume overload. \uf06c Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g., activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in vasopressin and endothelin-1). \uf06c Anemia. \uf06c Metabolic abnormalities e.g., disorders of calcium, magnesium, and potassium metabolism. 14.6.3 Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF\nThe combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and costs of care\nand may interact to worsen prognosis. A. Pharmacologic considerations\n\uf06c Safety:\n\uf0d8 Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the presence of renal\nimpairment (e.g., digoxin, insulin, low molecular weight heparin, direct oral anticoagulants). \uf0d8 Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury. \uf0d8 Safety of newer drugs:\n\uf077 ARNI - safety has been demonstrated for eGFR > 30 mls/min/1.73m2. A small study\nfound that it was as safe as irbesartan in patients with eGFR > 20 mls/min/1.73m2.739\n\uf077 SGLT2-i - safety has been shown for eGFR> 20 mls/min/1.73m2.740,741\n\uf077 MRA - only finerenone has been shown to be safe in patients with eGFR down to\n25 mls/min/1.73m2.373-376\n\uf0d8 There is a lack of published data on newer drugs such as ARNI and SGLT2-i at eGFR\n< 20 mls/min/1.73m2. If the patients are already on this drug and the eGFR drops to\n< 20 mls/min/1.73m2, or if there is a compelling need for initiation despite eGFR\n< 20 mls/min/1.73m2, shared decision-making with patients for off-label use is necessary. \uf06c Efficacy:\n\uf0d8 Impaired renal function affects drug choices and dosing. If eGFR < 30mls/min/1.73m2,\nmost thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and loop diuretics are preferred. \uf0d8 Higher doses of loop diuretics may be required with increasing renal impairment.

B. Prognostic implications\n\uf06c CKD is a risk multiplier in patients with HF - as the disease severity worsens, the risks of\nCV events, hospitalizations, and mortality increase.742 In patients with HF, worsening\nrenal function may not always indicate a poor outcome.743 The prognostic value of\nworsening renal function is mainly determined by:\n\uf0d8 The presence of persistent congestion. \uf0d8 Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes. \uf0d8 Duration - a persistently worsening renal function is usually associated with hemody\nnamic derangements and poor prognosis as compared with a transient worsening of\nrenal function as a result of aggressive decongestive therapy.744-746\n14.6.4 Management\nA) General Considerations:\n\uf06c A multi-disciplinary approach with an early referral to a nephrologist is recommended. \uf06c Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction such as hyper - or\nhypovolemia, concomitant medications such as aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, and renal\nartery stenosis. Cardiorenal (CRS) Subtypes\nDescription\nCRS Type 1 (Acute CRS)\nRapid worsening of cardiac function leading to acute\nkidney injury e.g., MI with cardiogenic shock. CRS Type 2 (Chronic CRS)\nChronic abnormalities in cardiac function leading to\nprogressive Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) e.g.,\nchronic HFrEF or HFpEF. CRS Type 3\nWorsening of renal function leading to acute cardiac\n(Acute Renocardiac Syndrome)\ndysfunction e.g., in Acute Kidney Injury. CRS Type 4 (Chronic\nPrimary chronic kidney disease contributing to\nRenocardiac Syndrome)\ndecreased cardiac function and an increased risk of\nCV events e.g., CKD leading to LVH, CAD. CRS Type 5 (Secondary CRS)\nPresence of comorbid cardiac and renal dysfunction\ndue to either acute or chronic systemic disease e.g.,\ndiabetes, sepsis, amyloidosis.

Therefore, close monitoring of renal function is essential:\n\uf077 In the landmark MRA trials, potassium was checked after 7 days (and again after 72\nhours if dose reduction was needed). \uf077 In the RAS blocker (ACE-I/ARB/ARNI) and SGLT2-i trials, laboratory assessment of\ncreatinine, urea, eGFR and electrolytes was typically done after 14 days during drug\ntitration and every 4 months thereafter. \uf077 The interval for monitoring renal function tests needs to be individualized depending\non baseline renal function, concomitant medications and comorbidities. With more\nadvanced CKD at baseline, renal function tests should be repeated within 3-7 days\nafter drug initiation and every time doses are titrated. \uf0d8 ACE-i/ARB/ARNI and SGLT2-i can lead to an initial drop in eGFR but this should not\nbe a reason to automatically stop or down titrate these agents. For HFrEF, both ARNI\nand SGLT2-i have renoprotective effects.749\n\uf0d8 ACEi/ARB should be up titrated to the maximum recommended dose to achieve\noptimal dosing provided:750\n\uf077 SCr levels remain < 30% from the baseline (or eGFR reduces < 25%) and\n\uf077 Serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/L\n\uf0d8 Consider reducing or discontinuing ACEi/ARB within two months from commencement\n(after excluding other precipitating factors) when:750\n\uf077 SCr levels remain \u2265 30% from the baseline (or eGFR reduces \u2265 25%) or\n\uf077 Serum potassium \u2265 5.5 mmol/L\n\uf0d8 A decrease in eGFR over time (beyond 2 months from commencement of medication)\nmay reflect the underlying disease process and is not necessarily a signal to automatically\ndiscontinue or down titrate the RAS blocker or SGLT2-i.749\nI,C\nI,C\nI,A\nI,B\nIIa,B\nIIa,B\n\uf0d8 In patients with advanced renal disease, the decision to start or stop RAS blockers\nshould be individualized.751 The discontinuation of RAS blockers in patients with\nadvanced and progressive CKD did not make any significant difference in kidney\ndisease progression and the long-term rate of decrease in the eGFR.752 Hence the\ndecision to continue or discontinue RAS blockers should be made according to the\nindividual patient\u2019s level of proteinuria, blood pressure control, tolerability and\ncardiovascular risk profile.", "chunk_order": 115}

In general, pregnancy is well-tolerated in women with cardiomyopathy and NYHA class I\npre- pregnancy. Factors increasing maternal and fetal risks include:757-761\n\uf06c Previous cardiac events\n\uf06c NYHA class III to IV or\n\uf06c LVEF < 40%.

Labour and delivery\nTiming and mode of delivery should be carefully planned by a multidisciplinary team. In the\nmajority of patients, vaginal delivery with epidural anesthesia is the preferred mode of\ndelivery. \uf06c Cesarean section is indicated:192\n\uf0d8 For obstetric reasons. \uf0d8 In patients on warfarin or who have discontinued their warfarin for < 2 weeks and who\nnow are in imminent labour. \uf0d8 In patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. \uf06c It is beneficial to shorten the second stage of labour by forceps or vacuum assisted\ndelivery.192\n\uf0d8 Left lateral decubitus position is preferred to attenuate the hemodynamic effects in the\nsupine position. \uf0d8 A slow i.v. infusion of oxytocin immediately after birth, (2 U of oxytocin given over 10\nmin followed by 12 mU/min for 4 h) reduces the risk of post-partum hemorrhage and\nhas a minimal impact on cardiovascular parameters.192\n\uf06c Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in patients with valvular heart disease\nundergoing uncomplicated vaginal delivery or Cesarean section.

The efficacy and safety of bromocriptine for acute PPCM\ntreatment, however, remains uncertain currently, particularly in the setting of contemporary\nHF and cardiogenic shock management.780,783 The use of bromocriptine increases\nthromboembolic risk and thus, adequate anti-coagulation is important. \uf0d8 Some patients may present with HF late post-partum and thus, they should be followed\nup closely long-term. They should also be counselled about subsequent pregnancies\nand the risk of relapse. Key Message #20: HF and Pregnancy\n\uf06c About 0.5-4% of pregnant women have cardiac disease. HF remains the most common\ncomplication among all women with heart disease regardless of the cause. \uf06c Women with cardiac disease should be assessed:\n\uf0d8 Before conception to assess their risk and to be advised accordingly and\n\uf0d8 Early in the pregnancy to optimize the outcome of the pregnancy. \uf06c Maternal cardiovascular risk can be assessed using the modified World Health\nOrganization (WHO) or NYHA classification.

CORONAVIRUS 2019 (COVID 19) +/- VACCINE AND HEART FAILURE\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n2 (SARS-CoV-2). In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of HF varied between 4% and 21%\nand about 8% - 33% required critical care admissions.784 Patients with HF who develop\nCOVID-19 had an overall mortality rate between 20% and 40%.784,785\nHF is an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and these\npatients were more likely to be sicker and develop complications. Patients with HFrEF did\nworse than those with HFmrEF or HFpEF.784\nPatients hospitalized for COVID-19 may develop both an acute decompensation of chronic\nHF as well as new onset HF. New onset HF was observed in as much as a quarter of\nhospitalized COVID-19 patients and about one-third of those admitted to the intensive care\nunit (ICU).786\nNew onset HF may be due to multiple mechanisms. These include myocardial injury due to\nthe direct effects of the virus, myocardial ischemia (Type 1 or 2 Myocardial infarction),\nmultisystem inflammatory syndromes, cytokine storm, stress cardiomyopathy, acute cor\npulmonale from micro and macro pulmonary emboli.787,788 Myocardial injury occurred in at\nleast 10% of unselected COVID-19 cases and up to 41% in critically ill patients or in those\nwith concomitant CV comorbidities.789\n14.8.1.

HEART FAILURE IN ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE (ACHD)\nMajority of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease are now surviving into adulthood\ndue to advances in medical and surgical treatment.794,795 However many of these adults with\ncongenital heart disease (ACHD) are at risk of long term sequalae with increased morbidity\nand morbidity. 14.9.1. Definition\nDefinition of HF in the ACHD in patients with biventricular circulation is like that of those with\nacquired heart disease.796\nHowever, defining HF in patients with Fontan circulation, may be more complicated.797\n14.9.2. Burden of disease\n\uf06c Prevalence of HF in ACHD ranges from 3.3% (median follow up of 27.5 years)798 to 6.4%\nat a mean age of 35 years.799\n\uf06c HF is the most common cause of death in ACHD patients, accounting for 17- 42% of all\ndeaths.800-803\n\uf06c The median age of death from HF was 48.4 years (range 20.2- 91.2 years)798 and varied\nbased on the complexity of the underlying lesions and interventions.799,800,804,805\n\uf06c Those patients with more complex CHD including systemic RV, single ventricle palliated\nwith Fontan circulation, and unrepaired cyanotic CHD with Eisenmenger physiology\ncomprise the majority of HF- related deaths.799,803,806\n\uf06c Hospitalization related to ACHD associated HF has increased significantly over the recent\nyears accounting for 11.8%-20% of all ACHD admissions.806,807\n\uf06c ACHD patients with HF had longer length of stay, higher burden of arrhythmias and were\nmore likely to die.807 One-year mortality after HF admission was 24% and 3-year mortality\nwas 35%.808 Male gender, pacemaker implantation, admission duration, non-cardiac\nmedication use, and high serum creatinine were identified as independent risk factors for\n3-year mortality.808\n14.9.3.", "chunk_order": 124}

Pathophysiology of HF in ACHD\n\uf06c Unlike acquired heart disease, the underlying mechanism for HF is more heterogenous\nand complex. \uf06c It is highly dependent on the underlying anatomy, presence of pulmonary arterial\nhypertension, timing and type of intervention, myocardial protection during surgery,\npresence of residual hemodynamic lesions and acquired comorbidities. \uf06c The most common reasons for ACHD-HF include presence of native, new, or residual\nhemodynamic lesions, myocardial failure and arrhythmias. \uf06c For the different causes of ACHD-HF based on the underlying pathophysiology, related\ncongenital heart disease and etiology tailored management see Appendix XIII,\npages 174-175. 186-187796,809,810\n14.9.5. Diagnosis of HF in ACHD\n\uf06c Diagnosing HF is challenging as typical clinical findings may not be present and most\npatients do not report symptoms of decreased functional capacity due to chronic\nadaptation since childhood.811\n\uf06c Interpreting the routine investigations also poses a challenge as many are abnormal even\nat baseline. \uf06c Assessment of HF in these ACHD patients should include a comprehensive review of\nclinical history, underlying congenital heart defect, previous interventions, signs, symptoms,\nand relevant investigations. \uf06c Due to the multifactorial etiology of HF in these patients, a patient-centered approach is\ncrucial. \uf06c Signs and symptoms of HF are non-specific. It can vary depending on whether it is due to\nbiventricular failure, systemic or sub pulmonary ventricle failure.812,813 See Section 6. \uf06c Chronic lymphatic dysfunction in failing Fontan circulation causes plastic bronchitis and\nprotein losing enteropathy (PLE) characterized by enteric protein loss.814\n\uf06c Right sided HF is more prevalent in ACHD compared to other acquired heart disease. \uf06c Patients with palliated or unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, Eisenmenger\nsyndrome or pulmonary to systemic shunts may have worsening cyanosis contributing to\nimpaired functional capacity with or without HF.

ADVANCED HEART FAILURE\n15.1. Heart Transplant\nHeart transplantation is well-established for refractory end stage HF. It is the gold standard\nfor the treatment of advanced HF in the absence of contraindications. World-wide the 1-year\nsurvival rate is 91% and the median survival post-transplant is 12 to 13 years.842\nThis definitive therapy for HF is however limited by the lack of donor organs.843 To address\nthis, worldwide, efforts are being made to increase this organ donor shortage by increasing\nthe donor age limit criteria, improving donor recovery strategies and being more stringent in\nthe selection criteria.155,843\nAll patients with severe symptomatic HF despite OMT and no other alternative therapeutic\noptions should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist\nhospital for further evaluation. Assessment for heart transplant is done by a multispecialty, multidisciplinary team and\nappropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.", "chunk_order": 128}

Thus, extensive\ndiscussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation. 15.3. Palliative and End of Life Care\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a progressive disease\nand carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed\nmedical therapy, should be considered for cardiac transplantation or LVAD implantation if\ndeemed eligible. This includes:\n\uf06c Those with < 50% survival at 1 year (using established scoring tools)\n\uf06c Persistently elevated natriuretic peptide levels and/or\n\uf06c A low V02 max measurement (if available) and\n\uf06c other eligibility criteria as stated in section 15.1. In patients who are unable to receive advanced therapy, palliative care consultation should\nbe considered.219,849 The aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and\nto promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.850\nAlthough majority of guidelines do not specifically address when best to refer end-stage HF\npatients for palliative care consideration, due to the often-unpredictable trajectory in decline\nover time, palliative care is particularly important in a subgroup of patients. A recent\ninternational consensus referral criterion for specialist palliative care for patients with\nadvanced HF includes 6 major categories:851\n\uf06c Patients suffering from advanced HF alongside complications including cardiac cachexia\nor multiorgan failure, having concurrent non-cardiac life-threatening diseases, or being\nintolerant to guideline-directed therapies.", "chunk_order": 129}

Care can be done in two different settings:\n\uf06c In the patient\u2019s own home - home-based interventions are associated with significantly\nlower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an improvement in the\npatient\u2019s quality of life.855 This may now be possible with telemedicine. \uf06c Specialist outpatient clinic - the HF clinic. HF clinics can either be:\n\uf06c Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF. \uf06c Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. HF clinics can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting.", "chunk_order": 133}

HF clinics can either be:\n\uf06c Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF. \uf06c Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. HF clinics can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The\nminimum human resource requirements are:\n\uf06c A cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and heart failure,\n\uf06c A dedicated nurse and\n\uf06c A medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minute-walk tests. In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of a cardiac rehabilitation team and physiotherapists\nto encourage physical activities, pharmacists and counsellors for end-of-life care would be\nadvisable. The needs of these patients vary, and these may need to be addressed by a\nmultidisciplinary team. These clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community\nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:887\n\uf06c Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting time of 7-12\ndays post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time). \uf06c Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification. \uf06c Who are stable but need up titration of HF medications. \uf06c With ICD or CRTs. \uf06c With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD. \uf06c With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n\uf0d8 Heart transplant. \uf0d8 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD). \uf0d8 Palliative care. The objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. They include:887,888\n\uf06c Optimization of Foundational HF medications particularly the up titration of \u03b2-blockers,\nACE-I and MRA. \uf06c Initiating referral for Cardiac Rehabilitation\n\uf06c Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its progression. \uf06c Promotion of self-care such as :\n\uf0d8 Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction. \uf0d8 Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and body weight. Patient with optimized HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the community\nwith appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and\nprimary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. Moving forward, it may be timely, to suggest establishing community medical care centers\nfor chronic illnesses such as diabetes, HF, CKD etc. This could serve as a resource and\nrehabilitation center for individuals with chronic illnesses. It could be run by both volunteers\n- doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, rehabilitation physicians - with funding from government\nand Non Government Organizations and offering tax incentives to all those participating in\nthe program. In 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was introduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare\nproviders to improve heart failure management.", "chunk_order": 134}

MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP\nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve to\nassess a patient\u2019s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease\nprogression. 17.2.1. Assessment during Follow Up Visits\nKey components of assessment include:\n\uf06c History:\n\uf0d8 Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test\n\uf0d8 Cognitive status and nutritional status\n\uf0d8 Diet and sodium intake\n\uf0d8 Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n\uf0d8 Smoking history\n\uf06c Physical examination:\n\uf0d8 Fluid status and body weight\n\uf0d8 Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm\n\uf0d8 Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n\uf06c Investigations:\n\uf0d8 Blood tests - serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary. \uf0d8 Serial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot be\nrecommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.77,81,891,892\n\uf0d8 Echocardiogram:\n\uf0d8 Routine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a\nrecent change in clinical status (e.g., episode of acute coronary sydrome) or if the\npatient has received treatment (e.g., revascularization or device therapy) that might\nsignificantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram\nis reasonable to re-assess the LVEF, degree of valvular function and structural remodeling. \uf06c Others:\n\uf0d8 Review of pharmacotherapy - compliance, side effects and titration of dosages as\nnecessary. \uf0d8 Control of disease specific management - hypothyroidism, hyperthyrodism, acromegaly,\nconnective tissue disease, HIV, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis. \uf0d8 Review use of potentially detrimental medication to HF control - e.g., NSAIDs. \uf06c Education:\n\uf0d8 Another key component during follow up is education regarding the name, dose and\nfunction of each medication the patient is on. This is not only important in terms of\nenhancing compliance, but this is also to avoid polypharmacy from a different facility\nthe patient may also be seeing. 17.2.2. Frequency of follow-up\nThis will depend on:\n\uf06c The patient\u2019s clinical stability and\n\uf06c Need for pharmacotherapy optimization. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should\nideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks.", "chunk_order": 135}

Ultimately, the intensity and type of\nfollow-up would be determined by the local organization of care and resources. 17.3. CARDIOLOGY REFERRALS\nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. Referral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations:\n\uf06c De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine the\netiology, and to devise a management plan. \uf06c Episodes of acute decompensation\n\uf06c Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy\n\uf06c HF that is complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting\nup titration of pharmacotherapy. \uf06c Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of\nrevascularization (PCI or CABG)\n\uf06c Resuscitated cardiac arrest. \uf06c Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g., AF, VT\n\uf06c ECG demonstrating a LBBB morphology with a QRS duration of > 150ms for consideration\nof device therapy. \uf06c Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular dysfunction. \uf06c Preconception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural heart\ndisease and a history of HF or LV dysfunction. \uf06c Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome. 17.4. TELEMEDICINE/TELEHEALTH\nTelemedicine services may improve healthcare accessibility and geographical limitations. In the unforeseen circumstances of a future pandemic, telemedicine may provide uninterrupted\npatient consultation when community lockdowns or social distancing is required.893\nEarly escalation of HF care with a multidisciplinary team is possible without the need for\nface-to-face consultation. 17.4.1. Telemedicine Strategies\nRequirements\n\uf06c Home Monitoring Equipment -The following are required:\n\uf0d8 Computer, tablet, or smart phone\n\uf0d8 BP machines\n\uf0d8 Weighing scales\n\uf0d8 Optional:\n\uf077 ECG recording device on smart phone. \uf077 Mobile monitor (e.g., Cardio Mobile)\nPatients, and/or their younger family members can record and transmit the information to\nthe physician. Virtual visits\n\uf06c This will help maintain the doctor-patient relationship. \uf06c These virtual visits can be performed via audio-visual telecommunication system or\nthrough an online portal to review the following:\n\uf0d8 Assessment of symptoms. \uf0d8 Review information from the Home Monitoring devices. \uf0d8 Where available, laboratory results from a laboratory close to the patient\u2019s home. \uf0d8 Optimization of Foundational HF Medications. Telerehabilitation\nTelemedicine can allow:\n\uf06c Initiation of dietary and physical cardiac rehabilitation. \uf06c Identification of cardiac decompensation and advise hospitalization, when necessary.", "chunk_order": 136}

Key Messages # 25: Level of Care, Shared Care, Monitoring and Follow - Up &\nTelemedicine/Telehealth\n\uf06c The care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system,\nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and\ncommunity (primary setting). \uf06c Heart Failure clinics will serve as an intermediary between in-patient hospital care and\ncommunity primary care. \uf06c HF clinics can either be:\n\uf0d8 Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF. \uf0d8 Physician-directed\n\uf06c At these clinics, patients with HF undergo close follow-up and monitoring to evaluate\ntheir status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. \uf06c When stable with optimized HF medications/treatment plans, patients can be discharged\nto the community with appropriate care plans to primary care. \uf06c Where necessary, (decompensation, development of significant arrhythmias) they can\nbe referred to the cardiologists/specialists. \uf06c Telemedicine services may improve healthcare accessibility and geographical\nlimitations. It can complement existing HF clinic services and provide venues for early\nescalation of HF therapy before decompensation. 18. OTHER THERAPIES FOR HEART FAILURE\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing\napproaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Center for\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative\nmedicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices,\nproducts, or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. 18.1. Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.894-898 Data seem to\nindicate that there is improved functional status, walk distance, and symptoms and NYHA\nFunctional class.896-897 There is however, concern that it could precipitate or exacerbate\nsymptoms in those with a history of HF.898\n18.2. Stem cell therapy\nStem cells, which are derived from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood, have been infused\ninto the coronary arteries or injected directly into the myocardium. The original hypothesis\nwas that stem cells would engraft in the myocardium and replace damaged cardiomyocytes. Subsequent research has suggested that stem cells probably do not differentiate into\nfunctional cardiomyocytes, but as an alternative hypothesis, it was hoped that they might\nhave paracrine effects that would benefit myocardial function. There is still limited knowledge on the optimal cell type, dosing, route of administration,\npatient parameters, patient safety, and other important variables that contribute to successful\nstem cell therapy. There is, however, still a lot of research left to do into the effectiveness\nand safety of these interventions.899-901\n18.3.", "chunk_order": 137}

Coenzyme Q10\nThere is some evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all-cause mortality and\nhospitalization for HF. However there still needs to be further research to determine the role\nof Coenzyme Q10 in patients with HF, the optimal dose, and the duration of Coenzyme Q10\nsupplementation.908-910\n18.5. Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 minute walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with\nHF.911-914 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalization, MI and mortality is not\nknown. 18.6. Yoga\nYoga improves peak VO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.915 In\naddition, it has been reported to reduce cardiovascular events, morbidity, and mortality\nalthough the evidence supporting these conclusions is somewhat limited.916\n19. PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF and\nconversion of scientific evidence into clinical practice.155,917 It has been shown that higher\nhospital performance measures were inversely associated with HF readmissions.918,919\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a\npatient, while outcome measures focus on the endpoints such as mortality or hospitalization. Process performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:155,917-919\n\uf06c % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class. \uf06c % of patients who had LVEF measurement. \uf06c % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications discharged\nwith ACE-I/ARB/ARNI. \uf06c % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications discharged\non \u03b2-blockers. \uf06c % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications discharged\non MRA. \uf06c % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/Atrial Flutter without contraindications on\nanticoagulant therapy at discharge. \uf06c % of patients given a post discharge appointment within 14 days. \uf06c % of patients who had up titration of their Foundational HF medications to target or\nmaximally tolerated doses at 3 months. The accepted performance measure is 60%. Outcome Measures indicators include:\n\uf06c In-hospital mortality\n\uf06c 30-day readmission for heart failure\nRefer to Appendix XVI, page 178 for calculation of these measures.", "chunk_order": 138}
