With current advancement, timely intervention, and early reperfusion\neither via medical thrombolysis or endovascular treatment, the outcome of stroke has improved\nsignificantly. The biggest challenge in Malaysia is the limited availability, not only in terms of a\ndedicated stroke unit in a major hospital but also the availability of reperfusion therapy, particularly\nmechanical thrombectomy. Furthermore, the lack of community awareness on the importance of\ntimely hyperacute intervention for stroke in Malaysia is still prominent. The 1st Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on the management of ischaemic stroke was published in\n2006 and the second edition was published in 2012. Since then, there was a rapid development in\nthe management of acute stroke, mainly with the improvement and advancement of reperfusion\ntherapy, encompassing both medical thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Furthermore, the\nimportance of timely intervention, especially in the emergency department, had significantly\nimproved the outcome in stroke patients. Therefore, this current CPG emphasizes the hyperacute\nmanagement and has introduced new chapters, for example, emergency medical services. With the\ngrowing numbers of elderly population in Malaysia, we have also included a new chapter on stroke in\nthe older person. This 3rd edition was developed to provide a clear and concise approach based on\ncurrent evidence with the focus being on the efforts to reduce time and improve pre-hospital care. We have summarised and adapted relevant clinical trials data and published literatures to our local\npractice.", "chunk_order": 2}

A panel of committee members was appointed comprising of neurologists, internal\nmedicine physicians, geriatricians, and emergency physicians from the Ministry of Health,\nuniversities, and private sector. Authors from the second CPG were invited to contribute on new\nupdates that were discussed by the panel members. The discussion started from early 2018 till 2020\nbefore being finalised and sent to the appointed reviewers. The panel members met several times\nthroughout the development of the guidelines. A review of the current medical literature on ischaemic stroke since the publication of the last CPG\non 31st Jan 2012 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases \u2013 PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was conducted\nfrom the period of previous CPG publication until 31st July 2020. The relevant MeSH terms or free\ntext terms were used either singly or in combination as the search strategy (refer Appendix A). The search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans, and published in the English\nlanguage. The relevant articles were carefully selected from the retrieved list. In addition, the\nreference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies. Local CPGs\nwere also studied. Experts in the relevant field were also contacted to obtain further information.", "chunk_order": 3}

In addition, the\nreference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies. Local CPGs\nwere also studied. Experts in the relevant field were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines mainly from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association\n(AHA/ASA) and the European Academy of Neurology/European Stroke Organisation (EAN/ESO)\nwere used as the main references. All literature retrieved were appraised and subsequently presented for discussion during the group\nmeetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively by members of\nexpert panels. Whereby the evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were agreed upon by\nconsensus of the panel members. The draft was then sent to local external reviewers for comments. The level of recommendations and the grading of evidence used in this guideline was adapted from\nthe U.S/Canadian Preventative Services Task Force and the Guidelines for Clinical Practice\nGuideline, Ministry of Health Malaysia 2003. The principles and layout follow the methodology stated in the Guidelines for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines booklet published by the Medical Development Division of the Ministry of Health Malaysia. These guidelines have been presented to the Chairman of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA)\nand Clinical Practice Guidelines Council of the Ministry of Health Malaysia for review and approval. Formulation Of Recommendation\nIn formulating recommendations for the CPG, evidence from the literature i.e. systematic review,\nmeta-analysis, randomized controlled trial or cohort study were critically appraised using CASP\n(critical appraisal skills program) checklist. Subsequently, the quality of each retrieved evidence and\nits effect size were carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group. In formulating the recommendations, the overall balances of the following aspects were considered\nin determining the strength of the recommendations:\n1. Overall quality of evidence\n2. Balance of benefits versus harms\n3. Values and preferences\n4. Resource implications\n5. Equity, feasibility, and acceptability\nClinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated addressing the diagnosis and\nmanagement of ischaemic stroke. 1. What is the current best practice for management of acute ischaemic stroke? 2. What are the strategies in stroke prevention? 3. What are the effective non-pharmacological modification in managing patients with stroke?", "chunk_order": 4}

Chapter 15: Management of Stroke in Pregnancy. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF STROKE CPG 2020\nChapter 1: Epidemiology, Definition and Classification Of Stroke\n1. Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and in Malaysia, stroke is the third leading cause\nof mortality. 2. Ischaemic stroke is the most common stroke, and hypertension was the most common risk factor\nfollowed by diabetes mellitus. 3. The new definition of stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) involved either pathological imaging\nor clinical evidence of ischaemia and can be timed based on the presentation of symptoms. 4. Ischaemic stroke can be classified according to clinical, phenotypic or aetiologic classification. Chapter 2: Causes and Pathophysiology\n1. Three main causes of ischaemic stroke include atherothrombosis of large vessels, intracranial small\nvessel disease, and embolism, which may contribute to up to 80% of the cases. 2. Cryptogenic infarction or stroke of undetermined aetiology may be responsible for around 20 to 40%\nof the cases despite extensive workout and usually would be a diagnosis of exclusion. Chapter 3: Diagnosis and Initial Assessment\n1. The diagnosis of stroke is made by evaluating and analysing information derived from a good history,\nphysical examination and selected diagnostic tests. 2. The symptoms and signs of stroke depend on the type, location, and the extent of the affected brain\ntissues. 3. A full neurological examination, including the patient\u2019s conscious level and tests of higher mental\nfunction is mandatory. 4. Stroke mimics commonly confound the clinical diagnosis of stroke. Chapter 4: Prognosis\n1. Haemorrhagic stroke has a higher mortality than ischaemic stroke. 2. There is a decline in stroke mortality in both men and women suffering from ischaemic or\nhaemorrhagic stroke due to the introduction of dedicated stroke units and improved control of stroke\nrisk factors. 3. The recurrence rates are 3-4% in the first month and 12% in the first year. 4. Progress of time is an independent covariate which reflects the spontaneous recovery of bodily\nfunctions.

The recurrence rates are 3-4% in the first month and 12% in the first year. 4. Progress of time is an independent covariate which reflects the spontaneous recovery of bodily\nfunctions. Chapter 5: Prevention of Stroke\n1. Stroke is a preventable disease and may be attributed to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. 2. Modifiable risk factors are the focus of primary prevention and can be clustered into three main\ngroups i.e. a)\nLifestyle risk factors, i.e., smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating\nb)\nMetabolic risk factors, i.e., high systolic BP, high cholesterol, high fasting blood glucose, low\neGFR and high BMI. c)\nEnvironmental factors, i.e., air pollution and lead exposure. 3. Secondary prevention of stroke involves the prevention of recurrent stroke, and this may involve\nmedical interventions includes antiplatelet therapy, anti-hypertensive treatment, lipid-lowering\nagents, glycaemic control, prevention of cardio-embolism and re-vascularisation procedures in\nselected cases. Chapter 6: Investigations\n1. Investigations carried out for stroke are aimed to confirm the diagnosis, determine the mechanism of\nstroke, stratify risk and to identify potential treatable vascular lesions. 2. Computed tomography (CT) brain is mandatory and preferred imaging in the emergency setting to\ndifferentiate haemorrhage from ischaemia, determine the site(s), cause, and extent of the lesion. 3. Advance imaging may be required in selected cases in the emergency settings, e.g., ruling out stroke\nmimics, reperfusion therapy in extended hours and determining potential re-vascularisation\nprocedure. 4. Selected blood investigations and imaging will be required in certain patients to determine the\naetiology of stroke. Chapter 7: Emergency Medicine Services\n1. The public should be encouraged to call 999 if they suspect a person is having a stroke. 2. Emergency medical dispatcher and prehospital care providers should be trained to recognize and\nidentify stroke and are able to provide rapid transportation of suspected acute stroke patient to\nnearest stroke ready hospital. 3. Assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke in emergency department should be prioritized\nin order to expediate the diagnosis of stroke and to determine the appropriate acute stroke\ninterventions. 4. Audit of acute stroke care and training of emergency department personnel should be conducted to\nimprove quality of care in acute stroke cases. Chapter 8: Acute General Management\n1. Acute general management in stroke includes supportive care and treatment of acute complications\nin order to improve the mortality rate and functional disability. 2. General management includes management of blood pressure, glucose control, nutritional support,\nprevention of infection and DVT, and also to treat potential sequelae, e.g. raised intracranial pressure\nand seizure.

General management includes management of blood pressure, glucose control, nutritional support,\nprevention of infection and DVT, and also to treat potential sequelae, e.g. raised intracranial pressure\nand seizure. Chapter 9: Reperfusion of Ischaemic Brain\n1. Intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose of 90mg) is recommended for the definite onset\nstroke for up to 4.5 hours from the onset. The treatment window can also be extended via CT\nperfusion with clinical evidence of penumbra-core mismatch up to 9 hours from the time of the last\nknown to be well/midpoint of sleep or via MRI (DWI-FLAIR mismatch) done to identify possible stroke\nonset within the last 4.5 hours. 2. Intravenous tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg;maximum dose of 25mg) is a possible treatment agent in\nacute stroke that presented within 4.5 hours with evidence of large vessel occlusion on imaging. Chapter 10:\nEndovascular Thrombectomy\n1. Hyperacute endovascular thrombectomy is recommended for the definite onset of stroke with\nevidence of large vessel occlusion which is within 6 hours from the onset. The treatment window can\nbe extended via CT/MR perfusion (penumbra-core mismatch) or MRI (clinical-imaging mismatch)\nwith current evidence showed significant benefit up to 24 hours from the onset/time of last known to\nbe well. However, treatment pathway should not be delayed, as the treatment outcome can be\ninfluence by the imaging-to-recanalization time. 2. Drip & Ship (IVT prior to EVT) as per Chapter 9 is recommended for eligible patients. Chapter 11: Stroke Unit\n1. The use of comprehensive specialized stroke care centres (stroke units) that incorporates\nrehabilitation services are able to reduce mortality and disabilities among stroke patients. Chapter 12: Stroke in The Older Person\n1. All older persons with acute stroke should be assessed for fitness/frailty level using a validated\ninstrument to facilitate a tailored and individualised treatment plan. 2. An older person can benefit from acute treatment for stroke including stroke thrombolysis and\nendovascular thrombectomy, providing the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the treatment are met. 3. An older person can benefit from and should receive treatment for stroke prevention with\nmanagement of polypharmacy issues, individualised medication dosages and treatment targets as is\ntolerated, for stroke risk factors. 4. All older persons with stroke should be:\n-\nscreened for delirium using a validated tool, and receive a tailored multicomponent intervention\nand management plan for delirium, when admitted with an acute stroke\n-\noffered falls and fragility fracture risk assessment and management during the\nrehabilitation period\n-\nassessed by a multidisciplinary team with an appropriate discharge plan\n-\nable to receive end-of-life care and recommendations when the prognosis is poor\neither from the stroke itself, complications, or other serious comorbid conditions\nChapter 13: Stroke and Cardioembolism\n1.", "chunk_order": 11}

Cardioemboli is a common cause of stroke. Stroke patient must have cardiac assessment to look for\nthe presence of cardioemboli. 2. It causes more severe stroke and\ncarry a higher morbidity and mortality rates. 3. Effective treatment to prevent cardioembolism is available and should be offered to patients at risk. 4. NOAC is preferred over VKA for NVAF. 5. Patient on VKA should have regular INR monitoring and aimed for time in therapeutic range (TTR) >\n70%. 6. Antiplatelet is not recommended in NVAF for the prevention of stroke. Chapter 14: Stroke in Special Circumstances\n1. Young onset stroke requires more comprehensive investigation to determine the stroke\naetiology. 2. Diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undertermined source (ESUS) is made\nafter standard evaluation to rule out possible cause of stroke. 3. Further specialized investigations needed in the cryptogenic or ESUS stroke for example\nprolonged Holter monitoring to look for atrial fibrillation or to look for evidence of patent foramen\novale (PFO). 4. Cerebral venous thrombosis is one of the major cause of venous infarct and would require\ninvestigations to determine the cause of thrombosis. Treatment mainly directed at\nanticoagulation with adjunctive therapy to prevent associated complications. Chapter 15: Management of Stroke in Pregnancy\n1. MRI of the brain (without gadolinium contrast) is the radiological modality of choice for investigating\nstrokes in pregnancy. 2. Aspirin is the only choice of antiplatelet for pregnant patients with a well-defined low risk profile. Chapter 16: Stroke Therapies with Limited Evidence\n1. There are a variety of stroke medications and treatment modalities, but the evidence is very limited.

III\nEPIDEMIOLOGY, DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF STROKE\n1.1 Epidemiology of Stroke\nStroke is a major cause of mortality and disability in many countries, including Malaysia. Global\nstroke estimates study reported that, in 2013, there were approximately 25.7 million stroke survivors,\n6.5 million deaths, 113 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and 10.3 million new cases\nof stroke.1 The high burden of stroke was mainly observed in developing countries, and accounted\nfor 75.2% of all stroke-related deaths and 81% of associated DALYs lost. Statistics from the Department of Statistics, Malaysia showed that stroke emerged as one of the top\nfive leading causes of mortality since 2000. Data in 2017 showed that cerebrovascular diseases\ncontributed to 7.1% of all mortalities recorded in the Malaysian population (Table 1.1). Table 1.1: Leading Causes of Mortalities in Malaysia\n1. Ischaemic Heart Disease\n13.9%\n2. Pneumonia\n12.7%\n3. Stroke\n7.1%\n4. Transport Accidents\n4.6%\n5. Malignant Cancer\n2.3%\n(Source: Department of Statistics Malaysia, 2017)\nIschaemic stroke accounted for 79.4% of all stroke cases, followed by haemorrhagic stroke (18.2%),\ntransient ischaemic attack (2%) and unclassified stroke (0.4%).2\nHypertension was the most common risk factor (72%), followed by diabetes mellitus (47%),\ndyslipidaemia (32%) and smoking (31%).3 Hypertension remains the most common medical risk\nfactor for stroke, whereas current smoking and physical inactivity are the most predominant\nlifestyle-related risk factors. In general, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and tobacco smoking tend to\nbe more prevalent among men, whereas hypercholesterolaemia, physical inactivity and obesity were\nmore prevalent among women.4\nThe mean age for ischaemic stroke in Malaysia was 62.8 years for the first stroke and 64.3 years for\nrecurrent cases.2 Malaysian women with a first-ever ischaemic stroke had a greater severity, higher\nnumber of risk factors and poorer functional outcomes, as compared to men. After post gender\u2013age\nadjustment, the Malaysian population observed an increased incidence of stroke in women as\ncompared to men.", "chunk_order": 26}

After post gender\u2013age\nadjustment, the Malaysian population observed an increased incidence of stroke in women as\ncompared to men. However, there was no difference between genders in terms of access to\nthrombolysis treatment.5\n1.2 Conceptual Definitions\n1.2.1\nStroke\nStroke is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by rapidly developing clinical symptoms\nand/or signs of focal, and at times global, loss of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting more than\n24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of a vascular origin. The new definition of central nervous system (CNS) infarction which incorporates scientific and\ntechnological advances is \u201cbrain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischaemia, based on\neither pathological imaging or other objective evidence of cerebrospinal cord or retinal ischaemic\ninjury in a defined vascular distribution, or clinical evidence of ischaemic injury, based on symptoms\npersisting for greater than 24 hours.\u201d 6\nStrokes may be classified and timed as: 7\nI. Early hyperacute (a stroke that is 0\u20136 hours old)\nII. Late hyperacute (6\u201324 hours)\nIII. Acute (24 hours to 7 days)\nIV. Subacute (1\u20133 weeks)\nV. Chronic (more than 3 weeks)\n1.2.2\nTransient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)\nTIA originally had a time-based definition characterized by an acute loss of focal cerebral or\nmonocular functions with symptoms lasting less than 24 hours and which is thought to be due to\ninadequate cerebral and ocular blood supply as a result of arterial thrombosis or embolism. However,\na time-based definition is inadequate because there is risk of permanent tissue injury (i.e. infarction)\neven when focal transient neurologic symptoms last less than one hour. TIA currently uses a tissue-based definition i.e. a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused\nby focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischaemia, without acute infarction.8\n1.3 Classification of Stroke\n1.3.1\nWhy Classify Stroke? Stroke classification has numerous implications during the immediate supportive care and\nrehabilitation, for prognostic purposes, guiding cost-effective investigations for underlying causes as\nwell as to aid decisions for therapy and secondary stroke prevention strategies. Apart from being\nuseful in setting up stroke registries and data banks for epidemiological studies, proper classification\nof the causative mechanism of stroke is important for optimizing stroke treatment and prognosis. 1.3.2\nWhat are Stroke Classification Systems that are Widely Used Nowadays? Ischaemic stroke classification can be categorized into:\nI. Clinical / Syndromic Classification\nII. Phenotypic Classification\nIII.

The Oxford Community Stroke Project (OCSP) which was developed based on clinical\nfindings especially neurological symptoms.9\nII. The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) which is a valid straightforward\nand is currently the most widely used classification system based on stroke mechanism. This\nclassification system is further subclassified to Stop-Stroke Study TOAST (SSS-TOAST) which\nis more specific using algorithms.10\nIII. The Causative Classification Systems (CCS) is a web-based system which uses multiple\nsources of clinical data and is highly dependent on the availability of modern diagnostic\ntechnology.11\nIV. ASCO is the first purely phenotypic classification in which every patient is characterized by\nA-S-C-O acronym: Atherosclerosis, Small-vessel disease, Cardiac source, and Other\ncauses. ASCOD Phenotyping of Ischaemic Stroke is the modified version of the ASCO\nclassification.12\nV. Chinese Ischaemic Stroke Classification (CISS) is a new two-step system that looks at the\naetiology and underlying mechanism of stroke. It takes into account the importance of\nintracranial atheromatous branch disease affecting penetrating arteries and the underlying\nmechanisms of ischaemic strokes caused by large artery atherosclerosis, that commonly found\nin the Asian population.13\nKey Recommendations:\n1. Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and in Malaysia, stroke is the third leading\ncause of mortality. 2. Ischaemic stroke is the most common stroke, and hypertension is the most common risk\nfactor followed by diabetes mellitus. 3. The new definition of stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) involved either pathological\nimaging or clinical evidence of ischaemia and can be timed based on the presentation of\nsymptoms. 4. Ischaemic stroke can be classified according to clinical, phenotypic, or aetiologic\nclassification. CAUSES AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\n2.1 Principal Causes of Ischaemic Stroke\nThe three main causes of ischaemic stroke are:1\nI. Atherothrombosis of large vessels (20-50%)\nII. Intracranial small vessel disease (25%)\nIII. Embolism (20%)\n2.1.1\nAtherothrombosis\nAtherothrombosis is defined as atherosclerosis with superimposed thrombosis.2 Atherosclerosis\naffects large and medium-sized arteries. The process begins in childhood as fatty streaks and\nprogresses over years with gradual build-up of fibrolipid plaque and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Thrombosis occurs when this atherosclerotic plaque is disrupted resulting in platelet aggregation. Atherothrombosis leads to local arterial occlusion with intraluminal propagation of the thrombus\nproximally or distally or it can result in distal embolism.", "chunk_order": 28}

Atherothrombosis leads to local arterial occlusion with intraluminal propagation of the thrombus\nproximally or distally or it can result in distal embolism. Intracranial large artery disease is the main\ncause of ischaemic stroke among South Asian patients.3\n2.1.2\nIntracranial Small Vessel Disease\nIntracranial small vessel disease is thought to be due to lipohyalinosis, microatheroma and fibrinoid\nnecrosis.4 The clinical syndrome caused by this phenomenon is lacunar infarction due to occlusion of\nsmall perforating arteries. Table (2.1) exhibits the vascular risk factors associated with increased risk\nof stroke.5-7\nTable 2.1: Common Vascular Risk Factors of Stroke\nNon-Modifiable\nAge\nMale sex\nEthnicity / Race\nFamily history of stroke\nModifiable\nHypertension\nSmoking\nDiabetes mellitus\nAtrial fibrillation\nCoronary artery disease\nObesity & physical inactivity\nRaised homocysteine levels\nHeavy alcohol consumption\nPrevious stroke\n2.1.3\nEmbolism\nCardioembolism causes approximately 20% of all ischaemic strokes.8 Embolic material formed within\nthe heart or large arteries travels through the arterial system, lodging in a vessel and partially or\ncompletely occluding it. The most common causes are atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease. Rare causes of embolism include air, fat, cholesterol, bacteria, and tumour tissues.9\n2.2 Other Causes\nOther causes include non-atherosclerotic abnormalities of the cerebral vasculature such as arterial\ndissection,\nfibromuscular\ndysplasia,\nvasculitis,\nMoyamoya\ndisease,\nhypercoagulable\nstates,\nmetabolic disorders, and inherited conditions such as Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy\nwith Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). 2.3 Cryptogenic Infarctions\nCryptogenic infarctions or stroke of undetermined aetiology are infarctions without a defined cause\ndespite a complete work up and account for 20-40% of all ischaemic stroke. Possible mechanisms of\ncryptogenic stroke are embolism secondary to occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,10 paradoxical\nembolism originating from the systemic venous circulation that enters the arterial circulation through\na patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or pulmonary\narteriovenous malformation and sub-stenotic (<50% stenosis) atherosclerotic disease. A new\nterminology for non-lacunar cryptogenic stroke without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic\nsources is Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS).11 Cryptogenic stroke is a diagnosis of\nexclusion.

Cryptogenic infarction or stroke of undetermined aetiology may be responsible for around 20 to\n40% of the cases despite an extensive workout and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT\n3.1 General Aim\nIn general, the diagnosis of stroke is made by evaluating and analysing information derived from a\ngood history and physical examination and is supplemented with selected diagnostic tests. Due to\nthe nature of the illness and the dramatic manner in which the neurological deficit occurs, history is of\nutmost importance. Every effort must be made to obtain information from the patient, family members,\nfriends, and witnesses. The diagnosis should provide answers to the following questions:\nI. What is the neurological deficit? II. Where is the lesion(s)? III. What is the lesion? IV. Why has the lesion occurred? V. What are the potential complications and prognosis? 3.2 Symptoms and Signs\nThe symptoms and signs of stroke depend on the type, location, and the extent of the affected brain\ntissue. Stroke patients usually have a sudden or rapid onset of focal neurological symptoms, within\nminutes to an hour. Some patients may, however, have a stepwise or gradual worsening or waxing\nand waning of symptoms. A third of all strokes occur during sleep at night, therefore, the weakness is\nfirst recognized on waking up in the morning. Diagnosing stroke in the initial hours is very difficult,\nparticularly when the onset is uncertain, the features are atypical or evolving, the patient is unwell or\nagitated, or when access to imaging is delayed, or when brain imaging is normal.1\nA full neurological examination, including documenting the patient\u2019s conscious level and tests of\nhigher mental function (such as the mini-mental state examination) is mandatory. Every positive and\nnegative finding should point to the site of lesion. These can be divided into 2 broad groups: a)\nclinical features that are caused by anterior circulation stroke (carotid artery); and b) those caused by\nposterior circulation stroke (vertebrobasilar system) (see Table 3.1).

About 16-42% of improvements can be seen during the first 6 to 10 weeks of stroke onset.28\nFollowing a first-ever stroke, around 60% of patients may survive up to 5 years.18 One-third of stroke\nsurvivors may exhibit some form of persistent disability after the initial episode of stroke. Up to 58%\nof patients who survive the first stroke will regain independence in activities of daily living (ADL), with\nmost functional recovery occurring within the first 2 months of stroke. Less functional recovery is\nobserved at the subsequent 4 to 5 months after stroke. Improvement in functional recovery is less\nthan certain after 6 months, however the known predictors of disability were older age, very low\npremorbid level of activities before stroke and subsequent recurrent stroke.29 Over a period of 10\nyears of follow-up, almost one half of survivors remained disabled, and one seventh required\ninstitutional care.26\nKey Recommendations:\n1.

PREVENTION OF STROKE\n5.1 Primary Prevention\n5.1.1\nEpidemiology and Risk Factors of Stroke in Malaysia\nStroke incidence and prevalence in Malaysia has increased steadily over the last 2 decades. Stroke\nis the third cause of mortality and the second leading cause of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY)\nin Malaysia.1 The incidence and prevalence rate for both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke in\nMalaysia had increased steadily from 2010 to 2014.2 Without effective interventions, stroke incidence\nwill continue to rise, thus increasing the healthcare burden.2\nData from the National Stroke Registry showed that first ever strokes contributed to about 79.2% of\nall stroke cases in Malaysia, while 20.8% were due to recurrent strokes.2 Therefore, primary\nprevention is the key to any national strategy to reduce the burden of stroke. Top modifiable risk\nfactors associated with first ever strokes among Malaysians were hypertension (69.9%), diabetes\nmellitus (41.4%), smoking (26.3%), hyperlipidaemia (24.4%), family history of stroke (5.8%),\nischaemic heart disease (IHD) and atrial fibrillation (3.4%). However, geographical and gender\ndifferences are observed.2 Hypertension and diabetes were significantly higher in women compared\nto men, while smoking and IHD were higher in men. Within Peninsular Malaysia, the East Coast had\nthe highest number of hypertensive patients, while the Southern regions had the highest number of\npatients with diabetes. East Malaysia reported the highest number of smokers.3\nThe INTERSTROKE study, which involved 32 countries including Malaysia, identified ten modifiable\nrisk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, waist-hip-ratio, poor diet, smoking, alcohol,\ncardiac cause, apo-lipoprotein levels and psychosocial factors) which accounted for 90% of\npopulation-adjustable risk (PAR) of stroke.4 The Global Burden of Diseases 2013 study identified\nthree clusters of modifiable risk factors associated with highest stroke burden in LMIC5:\nI.

Environmental - air pollution and lead exposure (33.9%)\nThe National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2011 and 2015 highlighted an alarming trend in the\nprevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among Malaysians, with 63% of Malaysian adults (>18\nyears) having at least one CV risk factor (overweight/obesity, high blood pressure, high blood\nglucose and high blood cholesterol).6,7 Based on NHMS 2015, the prevalence for the three major CV\nrisk factors among Malaysian adults were7:\n\uf0b7\nHypertension (known and undiagnosed) \u2013 30.3%\n\uf0b7\nDiabetes mellitus (known and undiagnosed) - 17.5%\n\uf0b7\nHypercholesterolaemia (known and undiagnosed) \u2013 47.7%\n5.2 Modifiable and Non-modifiable Risk Factors\n5.2.1\nNon-modifiable Risk Factors\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of risk factors for stroke among Malaysians allows prioritization of\nprimary prevention strategies specific to the needs of the population. Stroke risk factors can be\ncategorized into modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Non-modifiable risk factors include age,\nsex, and family history. Age: The cumulative effect of aging on the cardiovascular system and the progressive nature of\nstroke risk factors over a prolonged period of time substantially increase stroke risk. The risk of\nstroke doubles in each successive decade after 55 years of age.8,9\nSex: Stroke is more prevalent in men than women.8 Overall, men have higher age-specific stroke\nincidence rates compared to women.10 Exceptions are in the 35 to 44 year-olds and in those over 85\nyears of age, of whom women have slightly greater age-specific incidence than men.10\nCircumstances such as oral contraceptive use and pregnancy uniquely contributes to the risk of\nstroke in women.11-13\nFamily History: Both paternal and maternal history of stroke may be associated with an increased\nrisk. This may be mediated through genetic and shared environmental factors.14,15 Patients with a\nstrong family\nhistory of recurrent subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy should be\ninvestigated for CADASIL, Fabry\u2019s disease or mitochondrial diseases. (New recommendation)\n5.2.2\nModifiable Risk Factors\nThe National Stroke Registry has identified the following as the top modifiable risk factors for the\nfirst-ever stroke among Malaysians2:\n\uf0b7\nHypertension\n\uf0b7\nDiabetes mellitus\n\uf0b7\nHypercholesterolaemia\n\uf0b7\nSmoking\n\uf0b7\nIHD\n\uf0b7\nAtrial fibrillation\n5.3 Risk Stratification and Monitoring\n5.3.1\nCardiovascular Risk Estimates\nFor primary prevention strategies to be effective, understanding risk estimates is crucial for both the\npopulation at large and healthcare providers. Individualized risk estimation scores that takes into\naccount both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, validated across multi populations such as\nthe Framingham Stroke Risk Score Calculator, ASCVD and QRISK2 is helpful to create awareness\nand stratifying individuals according to cardiovascular risk categories.16,17 The Revised FSRS is\nshown to be better than the conventional FRS as it adjusts for temporal trends in stroke risk factors\nand has better discriminatory index for detecting stroke in various populations.18 These risk\nestimations allow stratifying of individuals into risk categories for better preventive strategies.", "chunk_order": 35}

Large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that reduction in blood\npressure reduces first ever and recurrent stroke by 40%.30,31\n(Level I)\nLowering the systolic blood pressure by 10mmHg is associated with a reduction in risk of stroke by\nabout a third, irrespective of baseline blood pressure levels.31\n(Level I)\nFor diabetics with hypertension, lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 120 mmHg or below\nwith careful monitoring of adverse events led to a significant reduction in stroke incidence.26\nRecommendation: Target BP for diabetics is <130mmHg systolic and <80mmHg diastolic,\npreferably <120mmHg if tolerated. (New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\nFor high-risk non-diabetic hypertensive patients, intensive systolic BP lowering to below 120mmHg\nled to excess adverse events without reduction in stroke incidence.27\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade B)\nRecommendation: Newly diagnosed hypertension in the very elderly (>80 years of age) should be\ntreated.32\n(New recommendation, Level I, Grade B)\n5.4.3\nSmoking\nThe Malaysian National Stroke Registry data showed that 51% of all patients with the first ever stroke\nwere smokers.

Ask and document smoking status for all patients. 2. Provide brief advice on quit smoking at every visit to all smokers. 3. Assess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Cigarette Dependence\nQuestionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using carbon monoxide (CO)\nbreath analyser (IF AVAILABLE). 4. Offer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless contraindicated. 5. If selected, use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for at least eight to twelve weeks,\nwhereas varenicline should be used for at least twelve weeks. 6. Combination therapy (e.g. two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g. bupropion with an NRT) is better than\nmonotherapy in smoking cessation treatment and may be most useful for those smokers at\nhighest risk of relapse. 7. Use smoking cessation medications with caution in special populations (e.g. children and\nadolescents, pregnant, breastfeeding women, psychiatric and substance abuse disorder\npatients). 8. Arrange a minimum of six to eight face to face follow-up sessions for smoking cessation\ninterventions in six months through counselling support team (health education officer,\npharmacists or any officer trained for quit smoking services). 5.4.4\nAlcohol\nAlcohol consumption has been identified as one of the risk factors for global stroke burden.33 Heavy\nalcohol drinking, of more than 4 units/day (1unit = 1glass wine = 1 pack of hard liquor), increases the\nrisk of stroke.

This should be tailored\naccording to the individual\u2019s stroke pathogenesis based on neuroimaging and investigations (see\nInvestigations). The risk for recurrent vascular events after stroke or transient ischaemic attack is approximately 5%\nper year for stroke, 3% per year for myocardial infarction and 7% per year for any one of stroke,\nmyocardial infarction or vascular death.52 This figure is even higher in certain populations, especially\nin those with high cerebrovascular atherosclerotic burden and for patients with ipsilateral high grade\n(70%) extracranial carotid stenosis.53\n5.5.1\nAnti-platelet Therapy\nAspirin: There is substantial evidence to support the use of Aspirin. A 25% risk reduction of stroke\nwas seen in all patients with stroke who received Aspirin.54 Aspirin given within 48 hours had shown\nto be beneficial in reducing recurrent stroke and deaths.54-56 Studies comparing the effects of\ndifferent dosages of Aspirin had failed to show any differences in stroke recurrences.57-60\nRecommendation: The recommended dose of oral Aspirin post-stroke is 75mg to 325mg daily.

Ticlopidine: Previous clinical trials demonstrated that Ticlopidine is slightly superior to Aspirin.61,62\nFull blood count monitoring is essential as neutropenia is the most important side-effect.61 Severe\nneutropenia usually occurs within the first 3 months of use. Thus, a baseline full blood count should\nbe performed every 2-3 weeks during this time frame. Ticlopidine can also be used if the patient has\nrecurrent symptoms despite Aspirin administration. Recommendation: The recommended dose of oral Ticlopidine is 250mg twice a day. (Level I, Grade A)\nClopidogrel: Clopidogrel is a newer thienopyridine derivative.

However, there are as yet no\nhigh-quality data regarding the use of Cilostazol for secondary stroke prevention in non-Asian ethnic\ngroups.66,67 The most recent meta-analysis showed that Cilostazol appeared to be effective for\nlong-term secondary stroke prevention without increasing the risk of haemorrhage.68 Combination\nuse of cilostazol with aspirin or clopidogrel was explored in open-label trial in Japan that showed\nadult patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke who had \u226550% stenosis of a major intracranial\nor extracranial artery, or two or more vascular risk factors, had lower recurrent ischaemic stroke\ncompared to monotherapy (3% vs. 7%) with similar bleeding rates.69\nRecommendation: The recommended dose of oral Cilostazol is 100mg twice a day. (Level I, Grade A)\nAspirin and Clopidogrel combination: Recent evidence from 2 large trials in minor stroke and high\nrisk TIA patients (NIHSS \u22643, ABCD2 \u22654), showed that those who received a combination of\nClopidogrel and Aspirin had a lower risk of major ischaemic events for 3 weeks to 3 months, but a\nhigher risk of major haemorrhage at 90 days than those who received Aspirin alone.70,71\nRecommendation: Dual antiplatelet therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin) is recommended for 21 days\nin patients with high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke.

The predominant\npathogenic process for stroke associated with cardiac disease is embolism due to formation of\nintra-atrial and intra-ventricular thrombus. Atrial fibrillation (AF) whether chronic or paroxysmal, is the most common cause of cardioembolism\nand accounts for 50% of all cardiogenic emboli. Other high-risk conditions are having prosthetic\nheart valves, rheumatic mitral valvular disease, acute myocardial infarction, and severe left\nventricular dysfunction.

Furthermore, asymptomatic\npatients should not be offered CEA if their 5-year probability of dying from unrelated causes is high. Finally, in the NASCET study, nearly 45% of all strokes occurring in patients with asymptomatic\nstenosis may be attributable to lacunar infarcts or cardioembolism.101\nRecommendation: Endarterectomy may be considered in patients with high-grade asymptomatic\ncarotid stenosis (70-99%) when performed by a surgeon with less than 3% morbidity/ mortality rate. (Level I, Grade A)\nCareful patient selection, guided by comorbid conditions, life expectancy, and patient preference,\nfollowed by a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of the procedure is required. It is\nimportant that asymptomatic patients receive appropriate medical treatment and be fully evaluated\nfor other treatable causes of stroke. 5.8.2\nSecondary Prevention\nTwo large randomized trials (NASCET and ECST) have compared the outcomes of patients with\nrecent cerebrovascular symptoms treated conservatively or with carotid endarterectomy.102,103\nLong-term follow-up and a meta-analysis is available for these trials.104 Standardizing the same\nmeasurements and definitions yielded highly consistent results among the 3 trials. In general, CEA is\nhighly beneficial for patients with carotid stenosis (70-99%), producing a 16% absolute 5-year risk\nreduction (ARR). For patients with 50-69% stenosis, the 5-year ARR was 4.6%. No benefit was\nobserved for patients with milder degrees of stenosis. Subgroup analyses revealed that benefits in\nsurgery was the greatest in men, aged 75 years or older, and those randomized within 2 weeks of\ntheir stroke event. These studies excluded patients with medical co-morbidities, previous neck\nirradiation and recurrent stenosis following previous endarterectomy. Extracranial-intracranial anastomosis between the superficial temporal and middle cerebral arteries\n(EC-IC Bypass) has not been shown to be beneficial for secondary stroke prevention by the EC/IC\nBypass Study Group. Recommendation: CEA is indicated for patients with carotid stenosis of 70-99% without a severe\nneurological deficit following a recent ischaemic event (less than 180 days) in centres with a\nperioperative complication rate for all strokes and deaths of less than 6%. (Level I, Grade A)\nRecommendation: Early CEA is indicated for patients with carotid stenosis of 70-99% without a\nsevere neurological deficit within 2 weeks of recent ischaemic events in centres with a perioperative\ncomplication rate for all strokes and deaths of less than 6%.

Several randomized trials have\ncompared\nextra-cranial\ncarotid\nangioplasty\nand\nstenting\n(CAS)\nto\ncarotid\nendarterectomy\n(CEA).99,101,105,106\nRecommendation: CAS represents a feasible alternative to carotid endarterectomy for secondary\nstroke prevention when surgery is undesirable, technically difficult, or inaccessible.107,109\n(Level II-2)\nIn recent studies, the 4-year outcome in death, stroke and myocardial infarction was similar in CAS\nand CEA. However, the periprocedural rate of stroke was higher in the CAS group while the\nperiprocedural rate of myocardial infarction was higher in the CEA group. Selection of patients for\neither CAS or CEA may require attention to age, with younger patients having a slightly better\noutcome with CAS and older patients having a better outcome with CEA.106-112\nThe criteria needed for a centre to do CAS:\nI. highly qualified surgeons and interventionists\nII. surgeons and interventionists that are credentialed\nIII. must use distal embolic protection device\nIV. use of dual antiplatelet therapy after CAS for at least 4 weeks\nRecommendation: Distal protection devices should be used during the procedure and use of dual\nantiplatelet for at least 4 weeks after CAS.

Audit of acute stroke care and training of emergency department personnel should be conducted\nto improve quality of care in acute stroke cases. ACUTE GENERAL MANAGEMENT\n8.1 General Management\nThe primary aim of acute stroke management is for early reperfusion therapy which will be covered in\nChapter 9 and 10. This chapter will cover the general management of acute stroke that includes\nsupportive care and treatment of acute complications. This is important to improve the mortality rates\nand reduce the functional disability. 8.1.1\nOxygen and Airway Support\nAdequate tissue oxygenation is imperative to prevent hypoxia and potential worsening of the\nneurological injury.1-5\n(Level II-3 to III)\nRecommendation: Patients with acute stroke should only receive supplemental oxygen if their\noxygen saturation is below 95% and be titrated to achieve above 95%.6-9\n(New recommendation, Level II-3, Grade B)\n8.1.2\nObservation\nRecommendation: Regular observation is mandatory to recognise impaired pulmonary function\n(pulse oxymeter), circulatory function (pulse rate, blood pressure), NIHSS score, head chart, GCS,\nand complications from mass effect.1\n(Level III, Grade C)\n8.1.3\nMobilisation\nMost patients are first treated with bed rest, but mobilisation should begin as soon as the patient\u2019s\ncondition is judged to be stable.10-13\nRecommendation: Mobilise early to prevent complications. (Level II-3, Grade C)\nAlthough two small RCTs showed that very early mobilisation (beginning within 24 hours) was\nfeasible in an acute setting, the AVERT trial showed that very early, more frequent and higher dose\nof mobilisation focused on out-of-bed activities in addition to usual care was worse in terms of\noutcomes than usual care alone. Very early mobilisation reduced the odds of favourable outcomes at\nthree months.14\nRecommendation: High-dose, very early mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke onset should not be\nrecommended. (New recommendation, Level l)\n8.1.4\nBlood Pressure\nIn patients with AIS, early treatment of hypertension is indicated when required by comorbid\nconditions\n(e.g. concomitant\nacute\ncoronary\nevent,\nacute\nheart\nfailure,\naortic\ndissection,\npost-thrombolysis sICH, or preeclampsia/eclampsia). In patients with a BP of \u2265220/120 mm Hg who\nhave not received IV alteplase or EVT and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute\nantihypertensive treatment, the benefit of initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the\nfirst 48 to 72 hours is uncertain. It might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours\nafter the onset of stroke.15-20\nRecommendation: Lowering BP initially by 15% is probably safe. Very high blood pressure should\nbe reduced gradually. (New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: Do not treat hypertension if systolic BP is <220mmHg or diastolic BP is\n<120mmHg. Mild hypertension is desirable at 160-180/90-100 mmHg.", "chunk_order": 60}

Mild hypertension is desirable at 160-180/90-100 mmHg. (New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: Proposed drugs: Labetalol 10-20mg boluses at 10 minute intervals up to\n150-300mg or 1mg/ml infusion, with the rate of infusion of 1-3mg/min or oral Captopril 6.25-12.5mg. Sublingual use of a calcium antagonist, such as Nifedipine, should be avoided because of the risk of\nrapid decline in blood pressure.21\n(Level II-3, Grade C)\n8.1.5\nBlood Glucose\nHyperglycaemia following acute stroke is strongly associated with subsequent mortality and impaired\nneurological recovery. This applies to both diabetics and non-diabetics.22,23\n(Level II-3, Grade C)\nThe International Diabetes Federation published a comprehensive guideline on managing older\npeople with type 2 diabetes which included a section on management of hyperglycaemia post-acute\nstroke.24\nAt present, the optimal level of blood glucose after a stroke is unclear. A systematic review of 11\nRCTs concluded that the administration of intravenous insulin to maintain tight glucose control within\na specific range (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide\nbenefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit, but\nsignificantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes.25\nRecommendation: After an acute stroke, treat hyperglycaemia to keep the blood glucose levels\nbetween 6.0-10.0 mmol/L and ensure that hypoglycaemia is avoided.24\n(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: Avoid very tight targets of glucose control (4.0-7.5 mmol/L) in the first few hours\nof acute ischaemic stroke. (New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n8.1.6\nNutrition\nSustaining nutrition is important as malnutrition after stroke might interfere with recovery.26 Persons\nwith infarctions of the brain stem, multiple strokes, large hemispheric lesions, or depressed\nconsciousness are at the greatest risk for aspiration. Swallowing impairments are associated with an\nincreased mortality. The FOOD RCT\u2019s showed that supplemented diet was associated with an absolute reduction in risk\nof death of 0.7% and that early tube feeding (within 7 days of admission) was associated with an\nabsolute reduction in risk of death by 5.8% and a reduction in death or poor outcomes by 1.2%.27,28\nRecommendation: Enteral feeding should be started within 7 days of admission (oral or tube\nfeeding). (New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\nA water swallowing test (refer to Appendix C) should be performed before the patient is allowed to\neat or drink. A wet voice after swallowing, incomplete oral-labial closure, or coughing reflex on\nswallowing indicates high risk of developing aspiration. There is good evidence that a multi-item\ndysphagia screening protocol that includes at least a water intake test of 10 teaspoons and a lingual\nmotor test was more accurate than screening protocols with only a single item.29\nRecommendation: Perform a water swallowing test.", "chunk_order": 61}

Insert a nasogastric tube if the patient fails the\nswallowing test. (Level III, Grade C)\nAn instrumental evaluation such as a video fluoroscopic swallowing examination (VFSE) or modified\nbarium swallow examination (MBS) can be performed later if indicated.1,30\n(Level III, Grade C)\nIf the patient fails the swallowing test, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to prevent aspiration. PEG tube is superior to nasogastric tube feeding if a prolonged need for devices is anticipated.31\nRecommendation: PEG is superior to nasogastric feeding only if prolonged enteral feeding is\nrequired. (Level II-1, Grade B)\n8.1.7\nInfection\nInfection is the commonest complication after an acute stroke especially pneumonia and urinary tract\ninfection.32\nThe appearance of fever should prompt a search for infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy\nshould be administered early.32 Bladder catheters should be avoided if possible.1\nRecommendation: Search for infection if fever appears and treat with appropriate antibiotics early.

REPERFUSION OF ISCHAEMIC BRAIN\n9.1\nIntroduction\nIn cerebral infarcts, restoration of perfusion to the ischaemic brain tissues is the key therapeutic\nstrategy. The concept of existence of an ischaemic penumbra is fundamental to the current approach\nin the treatment of ischaemic stroke. Although the core infarcted tissues might not be salvageable,\nadjacent dysfunctional tissue might be saved if the circulation is restored and metabolism is\nnormalized. Reperfusion therapy is the single most important and beneficial treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. It would be considered unethical if no attempt at reperfusion is made. Reperfusion therapy can be\nachieved via intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or/and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). IVT is indicated for patients with onset of symptoms within 4.5 hours of presentation, while EVT for\nlarge vessel occlusion (LVO) could be offered up to 24 hours using advanced imaging such as\nCT/MR perfusion scan. LVO include the ICA andM1 MCA occlusions. It is reasonable to include EVT\nfor ACA, PCA and basilar artery occlusions.1\n(Level I, Grade A)\nStroke treatment protocol and an organized stroke pathway is essential and should be established to\nachieve the recommended response time for IVT and EVT, in order to improve the clinical\noutcomes.1,2 Stroke organizations should incorporate the emergency department (ED) including their\npre-hospital care team, radiology department and stroke team.", "chunk_order": 66}

STROKE IN THE OLDER PERSON\n12.1 Introduction\nAn older person is defined as those aged 60 years and above by the Malaysian Ministry of Health. As\nthe average age of getting a stroke in Malaysia is 63 years, a significant number of stroke survivors\nare in the older age group. Older persons are heterogenous in nature and their physical and functional status can range from\nvery fit to very severely frail. An older person may also have cognitive function ranging from excellent\nto severe dementia. Older age alone should not be an exclusion criterion for stroke treatment without\nconsidering functional status and medical co-morbidities. This is providing that the older person fulfils\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria for the treatment. Frailty is defined as reduced physiological reserve causing a person to be more susceptible to insults. A useful scale in determining an older person\u2019s fitness/frailty level is the Clinical Frailty Scale.1 A fit\nolder person\u2019s treatment plan can have goals that approximate those of a younger person. However,\na hallmark of frailty is that the person has reduced tolerance to medical treatment and interventions. Hence, frail older persons need to be assessed closely for side effects and adverse events from\ntreatment. Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for stroke treatment examine frailty as a factor\nassociated with outcomes. Therefore, the clinician needs to make individualised decisions for\ntreatment based on each older person\u2019s characteristics. Recommendation: All older adults should be screened for frailty using a validated instrument\nsuitable for the specific setting or context with a tailored management plan thereafter.2\n(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\n12.2 Treatment of acute stroke\n12.2.1 Stroke Thrombolysis\nThe Cochrane review and meta-analysis shows that older patients benefit at least as much as those\nbelow the age of 80 years, so there is no upper age limit for stroke thrombolysis treatment,\nparticularly within the first 3 hours.3 Patients with mild and severe stroke and those with early signs of\ninfarction on initial brain imaging also benefit from treatment, as long as early radiological changes\nare consistent with the stated time of onset.

However, there is less direct evidence of benefit among patients older than\n75 years for the purpose of primary prevention of vascular events. In particular, in patients aged over\n75 years, the reduction in stroke rates was not found to be significant.9\nRecommendation: Statins are recommended for stroke prevention in older persons with less direct\nevidence of benefit for stroke prevention and primary prevention of vascular events in those aged\nover 75 years. (New recommendation, Level I, Grade A)\n12.3.4 Atrial Fibrillation\nOlder persons with atrial fibrillation can benefit from anticoagulation for stroke prevention, either with\nwarfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). DOACs were found to have a better efficacy/risk ratio\nas compared to warfarin.10,11 However, the cost of DOACs are considerably higher than warfarin, in\nterms of the medications themselves. It is important to follow the individual DOACs prescription guidelines taking into consideration their\nage, body weight and creatinine clearance to determine the appropriate dose of the DOAC. A higher\npercentage of older persons have impaired renal function, low body weight and sarcopenia. Prescribing a DOAC without following the prescription guidelines results in a higher number of\nstrokes and adverse events.12\nFalls and dementia are not absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, the decision needs to be\nmade on an individualised basis. Falls prevention measures and carer education are important in\nthese circumstances. The 2019 Beers criteria recommend that rivaroxaban and dabigatran are prescribed with caution in\nolder persons aged 75 years and above due to the higher risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.13\nThe OAC-FORTA (Oral Anticoagulant \u2013 Fit for the Aged) guidelines recommend apixaban as\nFORTA-A (highly beneficial) in older persons and the other DOACs and warfarin as FORTA-B\n(beneficial).11\nRecommendation: Older persons with atrial fibrillation can benefit from oral anticoagulant for stroke\nprevention with an individualised treatment plan taking medical co-morbidities, functional status, and\nsocial factors into consideration.

After receiving acute care, rehabilitation which is typically complex for older persons is offered as\nsoon as possible. Decisions about rehabilitation are made by the patients, family, and a\nmultidisciplinary team. Some patients may not need rehabilitation as they fully recover or have a mild\nneurological deficit that does not interfere with their daily activities. A very important stage of stroke recovery is called discharge planning and it begins with the person\u2019s\nreturn to community living after acute care and/or rehabilitation.31 Discharge planning is an important\nand complex process following acute stroke management to ensure a smooth transition from one\nlevel of care to another where the patient\u2019s level of care is matched to the site of care provision.

The predominant pathogenic\nprocess for stroke associated with cardiac disease is embolism due to the formation of intra-atrial\nand intra-ventricular thrombi. Atrial fibrillation (AF) whether chronic or paroxysmal, is the most common cause of cardioembolism\nand accounts for 50% of all cardiogenic emboli. Other high-risk conditions are prosthetic heart valves,\nrheumatic mitral valvular disease, acute myocardial infarction, and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Non-thrombotic embolism may result from atrial myxoma and endocarditis. Investigations are directed at demonstrating cardiac sources of embolism in the absence of\nsignificant atherosclerosis or other vascular disease. All patients with stroke/TIA require a 12-lead\nelectrocardiogram. A 72-hour Holter monitor is required to detect paroxysmal AF. In addition, all\npatients under 45 years of age and those in whom baseline investigations do not reveal an apparent\ncause for stroke will require a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Patients in whom there is high\nsuspicion of cardioembolism not found on TTE may undergo a trans-oesophageal echocardiogram\n(TOE).

STROKE IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n14.1\nStroke in Young Adults\nThe incidence of stroke in young adults (18 to 45 years) is increasing and the prevalence is reported\nto be approximately 10-15% of all stroke patients.1 The causes and risk factors of stroke in young\nadults is distinct from those in older patients, in which cardiac embolism and other aetiologies are\nmore common, notably non-atherosclerotic arteriopathies and haematological disorders.2,3 Therefore,\nthe diagnostic evaluation and management strategy are usually more comprehensive and\nchallenging. This chapter will cover the aetiology and risk factors in young adults with stroke, in\naddition to the diagnosis and management of specific causes of stroke in young adults. 14.2\nYoung Stroke Aetiology\nThe causes of ischaemic stroke in young adults are diverse and vary by age, gender, and\ngeographic region.4 The causes may be classified according to the TOAST classification. Non-atherosclerotic arteriopathies such as arterial dissection as well as premature atherosclerosis\ndue to hypertension, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidaemia are collectively the most common\ncauses of ischaemic stroke in young individuals.3,5 But often, the cause of the stroke is unknown.6\nCryptogenic stroke is defined as stroke without any probable cause identified after adequate\ndiagnostic evaluation.7-10 Cryptogenic stroke has been reported in up to 40% of young stroke cases.4\nIn 2014, the clinical construct of \u201cembolic stroke of undetermined source\u201d (ESUS) was introduced to\nidentify patients with non-lacunar cryptogenic ischaemic strokes in whom embolism was the likely\nstroke mechanism. About 1/6 of stroke patients are labelled as ESUS and they are generally younger\npatients with milder stroke but are associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence.7,8 To date, there\nis no evidence to suggest the role of anticoagulants in the management of ESUS.

MANAGEMENT OF STROKE IN PREGNANCY\n15.1\nBurden and Aetiology\nThe incidence of pregnancy-associated stroke is 10.2 per 100\u2009000 deliveries.1 The incidence rate of\nstroke in pregnancy is higher in the peripartum and postpartum period, especially in the first six to\ntwelve weeks after delivery.2-5 In a Japanese study, most pregnancy-associated strokes were\nhaemorrhagic strokes (73.5%), less than a quarter (24.5%) were ischaemic strokes and rarely, there\nwere mixed strokes (2%).6\nIn a previous study, 75.7% of the patients with ischaemic stroke were arterial infarcts and 24.3%\nwere venous infarctions.6 Main causes of ischaemic stroke in pregnancy were congenital heart\ndiseases, valvular heart diseases, atrial fibrillation (AF) and inheritable coagulation abnormalities.1\nMost common aetiologies of cerebral haemorrhage were aneurysm (19.8%), arteriovenous\nmalformation (17.1%), pregnancy-induced hypertension (11.7%) and HELLP syndrome.1\n15.2\nInvestigations\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (without gadolinium contrast) is the radiological\nmodality of choice for investigating strokes in pregnancy.5 MRI of the brain in the antenatal period is\nnot associated with increased adverse events to the foetus.7-9 However, MRI of the brain should be\nused carefully.8 MRI of the brain should only be used when the test can answer the patient\u2019s clinical\nquestion and provides medical benefits to the pregnant patient.8 However, antenatal exposure to\ngadolinium contrast was reported to increase the risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, rheumatological,\ninflammatory and infiltrative skin conditions in one study.9\n15.3\nManagement\nBlood pressure should be reduced to less than 160/110 mmHg.10 In cases of preeclampsia or severe\nhypertension with neurological symptoms, the aim is to achieve an urgent and sustained reduction of\nblood pressure to less than 160/110 mmHg to reduce the risk of maternal stroke.10 In acute\nhaemorrhagic stroke in pregnancy, blood pressure can be controlled with Methyldopa, Labetalol and\nlong acting Nifedipine.10 The goal is to correct the blood pressure to <160/110 mmHg, followed by\ntitration of the anti-hypertensive medications to reduce the blood pressure consistently to <140/90\nmmHg.10 The coagulopathies should also be corrected.10\nRecommendation: In ischaemic arterial strokes, Aspirin up to 150\u200amg daily is well tolerated during\npregnancy.5 Pregnant patients with a well-defined low risk conditions may be given UFH or LMWH in\nthe first trimester, followed by a low dose of aspirin in the second and third trimesters.11\n(Level II, Grade B)\nRecommendation: In pregnant patients with a well-defined low risk conditions, no antiplatelet other\nthan Aspirin can be prescribed.11\n(Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: In pregnant women with a well-defined high-risk condition, Vitamin K\nantagonists need to be avoided between the 6th and 12th weeks of pregnancy and also near the\nterm.11\nDuring this period, UFH or LMWH can be used.11\n(Level II, Grade B)\nRecommendation: In addition, the pregnant patients with a well-defined high-risk condition on\nDOACs should be given UFH or LMWH between the 6th and 12th weeks of pregnancy.11\n(New recommendation, Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: At other weeks of gestation, Warfarin can be given.11\n(Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: When the labour process is pharmacologically induced, Aspirin can be\ncontinued.11\n(Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: UFH and LMWH need to be stopped 24 hours before the induction of labour.11\n(Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: UFH and LMWH should be restarted within 24 hours of delivery if there are no\ncontraindications.11\n(Level III, Grade C)\nRecommendation: Vitamin K antagonists (without a loading dose) may be restarted after 24 hours\nof delivery if there are no contraindications.11\n(Level III, Grade C)\nPatients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can be administered with either unfractionated\nheparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) till at least six weeks postpartum.12 The\nmanagement of the patients with dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries includes monitoring\nonly or using low-dose Aspirin.12 LMWH can be considered in some cases in which dissection is in\nthe highest thrombotic risk period (peri-partum to six weeks post-partum).12\nThere is lack of evidence regarding the safety of statins in pregnancy.12 Statins should be stopped\nduring preconception and throughout pregnancy.12 In general, stroke management decisions are\nbased on symptom severity, maternal medical conditions, and wishes of the patient and her family.10\nRehabilitation should be started early.10 Rehabilitation is based on a multidisciplinary team\ndiscussions and decisions.10\nRecommendations Summary:\nTable 15.1: Management of Stroke in Pregnancy\nManagement\nRecommendations\nLevel

STROKE THERAPIES WITH LIMITED EVIDENCE\nA variety of medicines and treatment modalities have been used for stroke. Although yet to be\nproven effective, they may be considered for treatment in acute stroke (Table 16.1). Table 16.1: Stroke Therapy Modalities\nTherapy\nDescription\nNeuroAid\nThe medicine did not demonstrate any statistically significant benefit after 3\nmonths although some small studies showed that it could be effective in\nimproving functional independence and motor recovery, and is safe for\npatients with a primarily non-acute stable stroke.1-3\nCiticoline\nCiticoline is widely used after stroke but is not proven statistically to be\nbeneficial in the treatment of acute stroke.4,5\nCerebrolysin\nCerebrolysin is also not proven in the management of acute stroke.6-8\nEdaravone\nMeta-analysis of Edavarone showed some benefits in improving neurological\nimpairment in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage but was\nnot proven to reduce death and long-term disability in both types of stroke.9\nGingko\nThere was limited evidence on to support the use of gingko biloba in terms of\nimproving quality of life and other stroke events. As such, more studies are\nneeded before it can be recommended for routine use in improving\nneurological and cognitive function in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.10\nVitamin B\nBased on the Vitatops trial, Vitamin B supplements did not help in secondary\nstroke prevention but showed some benefit if the patient had concomitant\nhyperhomocysteinaemia.11,12\nFolic Acid\nFolic acid supplementation did not demonstrate a major effect in preventing\nstroke.", "chunk_order": 98}

However, potential mild benefits in primary stroke prevention,\nespecially when folate is combined with B vitamins and in male patients,\nrequires further investigation.13\nSelective\nSerotonin\nReuptake\nInhibitors\nFluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to\nimprove the functional outcomes. A study showed that even though the\ntreatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of\nbone fractures. Therefore, recent evidence does not support the routine use\nof fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to\npromote recovery of function.14\nAcupuncture\nAcupuncture, from multiple trials, did not show any significant benefit and\nefficacy in terms of functional recovery after stroke.15-17 A recent\nmeta-analysis concluded that the apparent reduction in dependency and\nimprovement in neurological recovery associated with the use of acupuncture\nin acute stroke are confounded by the use of open controls .However the\nadverse events associated with acupuncture were generally reported to be\nminor and usually did not result in stopping treatment.18\nTranscranial\nMagnetic\nStimulation (TMS)\nTMS has shown some promising results in improving the motor recovery after\nstroke. However, it may need more evidence before it can be used as a daily\nrehabilitation tool for r stroke.19-22\nTocovid\n(Tocotrienol)\nTocovid (tocotrienol) has only been proven in animal studies to be effective as\nneuroprotective treatment in stroke, but not in human studies.23-25 However,\none study showed that tocotrienol may attenuate the progression of white\nmatter lesion26. Selenium\nSelenium levels have been shown to be on the lower side during an acute\nstroke. However, there is still no evidence of benefit from Selenium\nsupplementation in acute stroke although a few animal studies have shown\nsome benefits.27-29\nPiracetam\nPiracetam played a limited role in the rehabilitation of the overall language\nimpairment and only showed benefit as regards to the written language ability\nbased on a meta-analysis. Its effect on the overall linguistic level and written\nlanguage tends to emerge within a short period and declines thereafter. Piracetam also did not significantly improve neurologic or functional outcome\nin acute stroke patients.30,31\nKey Recommendations:\n1.

Operational definition - Terms and Descriptions\n(Reference Chapter: Chapter 7)\nTerms\nDescriptions\nBypass\nAmbulances are directed to other facilities by bypassing the\noriginal destination. It is to ensure the stroke patient is sent to the\nnearest stroke centre rather than a facility that is not capable of\nthrombolysing the stroke patient. Call taker\nA trained person in MECC who receives calls from the public\nthrough 999 and manages the call. Dispatch priority\nLevel of priority assigned to each case according to the clinical\nurgency. There are 4 levels of priority: Priority 1, priority 2, priority\n3 and priority 4. Priority 1 is the highest priority level in the dispatch\nsystem. Dispatching\nsystem\nA computerized system in MECC manned by the call taker to\nmanage all incoming 999 calls from the public and dispatches the\nappropriate response team to the scene. PHC responder\nA medically trained person (usually an Assistant Medical Officer /\nStaff Nurse) who responds to pre-hospital calls.
