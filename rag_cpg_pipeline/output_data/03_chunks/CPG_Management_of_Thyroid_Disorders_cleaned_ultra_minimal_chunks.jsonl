HYPERTHYROIDISM\n\u2022\nIn patients with suspected hyperthyroidism, serum TSH and fT4 should\nbe obtained at the initial evaluation. fT3 should be measured when TSH is\nsuppressed but fT4 is within normal range. \u2022\nPatients with overt Graves\u2019 hyperthyroidism should be treated with any of the\nfollowing modalities: ATDs, RAI therapy, or thyroidectomy. \u2022\nIf ATD is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, the medication should be\ncontinued for approximately 12\u201318 months, and then discontinued if the TSH\nlevels are normal at that time. \u2022\nIf surgery is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, near total or total\nthyroidectomy is the procedure of choice and should be referred to a highvolume thyroid surgeon. \u2022\nPatients with overtly TMNG or TA should be treated with RAI therapy or\nthyroidectomy. On occasion, long-term, low-dose treatment with MMI may be\nappropriate. \u2022\nA differential WBC count should be obtained during febrile illness and at the\nonset of pharyngitis in all patients taking antithyroid medication. \u2022\nLiver function and hepatocellular integrity should be assessed in patients taking\nMMI or PTU who experience pruritic rash, jaundice, light-coloured stool or dark\nurine, joint pain, abdominal pain or bloating, anorexia, nausea, or fatigue.", "chunk_order": 1}

HYPOTHYROIDISM\n\u2022\nLevothyroxine is the recommended preparation of choice and the mainstay of\ntreatment of hypothyroidism. The three main aims of therapy are:\ni)\n\u0007To provide resolution of signs and symptoms, including biological and\nphysiological markers of hypothyroidism\nii) \u0007To achieve normalisation of serum TSH with improvement in thyroid\nhormone concentrations\niii) \u0007To avoid iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis or overtreatment particularly in the\nelderly\n\u2022\nLevothyroxine is best taken on empty stomach (1 hour before breakfast or at\nbedtime, at least 3 hours after the last meal of the day) because absorption\nis impaired if taken with food. Compliance may be enhanced however, by\ninstructing patients to consistently take it before breakfast each day. CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n2\n\u2022\nLevothyroxine replacement therapy can be started as an initial full replacement\nor as partial replacement with gradual dose increments titrated using serum\nTSH as the goal. Dose adjustments should be made when there are significant\nchanges in body weight, and with pregnancy and ageing. Serum TSH should be\nreassessed 4\u20138 weeks after any dose adjustments. SUBCLINICAL THYROID DISORDERS\n\u2022\nWhen TSH is persistently <0.1 mIU/L, treatment of SCHyper is recommended in\nall individuals >65 years of age. \u2022\nAntithyroid drugs should be the first line and initial treatment for subclinical\nhyperthyroidism, whatever the aetiology. \u2022\nRadioactive iodine therapy should be considered in those with persistent\nand progressive subclinical hyperthyroidism due to autonomous nodule and\nmultinodular goitre. \u2022\nInvestigation of raised TSH requires repeated measurements to establish a firm\ndiagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism. THYROID NODULES/GOITRE\n\u2022\nAll patients with a suspected thyroid nodule/nodular goitre or radiographic\nabnormality suggesting a thyroid nodule incidentally detected on another\nimaging study should undergo a dedicated thyroid/neck US that encompasses\nthe thyroid as well as the central and lateral neck compartments. \u2022\nSurgery is recommended in:\ni. symptomatic compression or large goitres (>80 g)\nii. relatively low uptake of RAI\niii. \u0007when thyroid malignancy is documented or suspected (e.g. suspicious or\nindeterminate cytology)\niv. \u0007large thyroid nodules, especially if greater than 4 cm or if nonfunctioning, or\nhypofunctioning on 123I or 99mTc pertechnetate scanning\nv. coexisting hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery\nvi. especially if TRAb levels are particularly high\nvii. patients with moderate-to\u2013severe active Graves\u2019 Ophthalmopathy (GO)\n\u2022\nSurgery is not recommended for patients with substantial comorbidity such as\ncardiopulmonary disease, end-stage cancer, or other debilitating disorders, or\nwhere there is lack of access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon. \u2022\nSubacute thyroiditis should be suspected in all patients who present with painful\ngoitre.", "chunk_order": 2}

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n3\nTHYROID EMERGENCIES\nThyroid Storm\n\u2022\nThe diagnosis of thyroid storm is clinical. Both the BWPS and JTA diagnostic tools\ncould be used to aid diagnosis, but we recommend the use of BWPS as this\nscoring tool is more sensitive. \u2022\nHigh doses of PTU (500\u20131000 mg loading, then 250 mg, 4\u20136 hourly) should be\nused in thyroid storm. In the presence of contraindications, high doses of MMI\n(60\u201380 mg/day) can be used. \u2022\nb-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as propranolol should be administered\nin thyroid storm to control heart rate and inhibit other peripheral action of\nthyroid hormone. \u2022\nShorter acting intravenous esmolol or diltiazem can be used to control heart rate\nwhen there are contraindications to b-adrenergeic receptor antagonists. \u2022\nHigh doses of glucocorticoids (IV hydrocortisone 100 mg, 6 hourly or\ndexamethasone 2 mg, 6 hourly) should be given in thyroid storm. \u2022\n5\u201310 drops of Lugols iodine 6\u20138 hourly for the first 10 days, should be given after\nadministration of antithyroid drugs for rapid improvement of thyrotoxicosis in\nthyroid storm. \u2022\nAll patients with thyroid storm should have early definitive therapy with RAI. In patients with large obstructing goitre or contraindications to RAI, early\nthyroidectomy should be considered instead. Myxoedema Coma\n\u2022\nIntravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg start then 100 mg 6\u20138 hourly should be\nadministered prior to levothyroxine. \u2022\nInitial intravenous levothyroxine of 200\u2013400 mg followed by 1.6 mcg/kg/day\n(75% if administered intravenously) should be given thereafter. If intravenous\nlevothyroxine is not available, oral levothyroxine can be given as 500 mcg loading\nfollowed by maintenance dose. \u2022\nIntravenous liothyronine (when available) may be given in addition to thyroxine. Loading dose recommended is 5\u201320 mcg followed by 2.5\u201310 mcg every 8 hours\ntill patient regains consciousness. Pre-/Perioperative Management\n\u2022\nAll elective surgery should be postponed until euthyroidism or near euthyroid\nstate is achieved. \u2022\nIn patients who are hyperthyroid and require urgent surgery, rapid control\nwith high dose MMI or PTU, b-blockers, Lugol\u2019s iodine and glucocorticoids are\nrecommended.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n4\nTHYROID DISORDERS IN PREGNANCY\n\u2022\nPregnant women with OH should be treated with LT4. \u2022\nFor maternal SCHypo, LT4 treatment is recommended in the following situations\nto reduce the risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery:\na)\nPregnant women with negative TPOAb:\n-\u2003LT4 is recommended if TSH is >10 mIU/L\n-\u2003\u0007LT4 may be considered if TSH is above the pregnancy specific reference\nrange or 4.0 mIU/L\nb) Pregnant women with positive TPOAb:\n-\u2003\u0007LT4 is recommended if TSH is above the pregnancy specific reference\nrange or 4.0 mIU/L\n-\u2003LT4 may be considered if TSH is >2.5 mIU/L\n\u2022\nFor hypothyroid women already treated with LT4 before conception, we\nrecommend a TSH goal of not more than 2.5 mIU/L before conception and during\nfirst trimester as the trimester specific reference range for Malaysian population\nis not available. \u2022\nDuring the second and third trimester, a TSH goal of 3.0 mIU/L or below can be\nadopted. \u2022\nPregnant women who are already treated with LT4 before conception are\nrecommended to have their LT4 dosage increased by 30%\u201350% upon conception\nwith a higher percentage being considered for post ablative hypothyroidism and\nlower percentage for autoimmune hypothyroidism. \u2022\nWhen a suppressed TSH and elevated fT4 are detected in the first trimester,\nclinical history and physical examination should be performed to determine\nthe aetiology. Graves\u2019 disease is differentiated from gestational thyrotoxicosis\nclinically. TRAb supports the diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease. \u2022\nManagement of gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is mainly through\nsupportive therapy: rehydration and hospitalisation if needed in the presence of\nhyperemesis gravidarum; and b-blocker if very symptomatic. Antithyroid drug is\nnot recommended. \u2022\nIn pregnant women in whom ATD needs to be continued; PTU is recommended\nthroughout the first trimester. \u2022\nThe lowest effective dose of ATD should be used for thyrotoxicosis during\npregnancy, targeting fT4 at or moderately above the reference range. \u2022\nIn postpartum thyroiditis\n-\n\u0007Women in thyrotoxic phase of PPT who are symptomatic should be treated\nwith b-blockers; ATDs are not recommended. -\n\u0007Women in hypothyroid phase of PPT and who are symptomatic should be\ntreated with thyroxine. Women with mild symptoms who choose not to be\ntreated need to have their TFT checked every 4\u20138 weekly until euthyroidism\nis restored.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n5\nACQUIRED HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERTHYROIDISM IN CHILDREN AND\nADOLESCENTS\n\u2022\nHypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis: Levothyroxine is\nrecommended as the medication of choice with the recommended dose is\nbased on the body weight or body surface area. The recommended target range\nfor TSH is in the lower half of the reference range while for free T4 is in the upper\nhalf of the reference range. Levothyroxine is effective in reducing the thyroid\ngland size/goitre. \u2022 Non-goitrous euthyroid Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis: One should monitor for goitre,\nantithyroid antibodies and pattern of thyroid function; treatment with thyroxine\nis controversial. \u2022 Hyperthyroidism: The first-line initial treatment is ATD, which is carbimazole\nor its active metabolite MMI. Methimazole/carbimazole dose typically used is\n0.2\u20130.5 mg/kg daily, with a range from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily (maximal\ninitial dose: 30 mg daily). After 2\u20134 weeks, when the thyroid hormone levels have\nnormalised, the initial dose should gradually be reduced by 30%\u201350%. TSH levels\nmay take 2\u20134 months to appear in the serum and should not be used to titrate\nthe dose. If children develop serious adverse reactions to MMI, RAI or surgery\nshould be considered, because the risks of PTU are considered greater than the\nrisks of RAI or surgery. \u2022\nHyperthyroidism: Propylthiouracil (PTU) should not be used in children. If it is\nused, it should be stopped immediately and liver function should be assessed in\nchildren who develop anorexia, pruritus, rash, jaundice, light coloured stool or\ndark urine, joint pain, right upper quadrant pain or abdominal bloating, nausea\nor malaise due to the risk of idiosyncratic liver failure. \u2022\nHyperthyroidism: Definitive therapy available for GD is RAI or thyroidectomy. Indications for definitive treatment in children include relapse after an\nappropriate duration of ATD, a lack of compliance on the part of the patient/\ncaretakers or adverse effects of ATD. The issue of how long ATDs should be used\nin children before considering either RAI or surgery is controversial.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n8\nA total of 138 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. The DG members met 11 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using the\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and\nfurther discussed at each DG meeting. All statements and recommendations\nformulated after that were agreed upon by the DG. Where evidence was\ninsufficient, recommendations were made by consensus of the DG. Any differences\nin opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely on the findings\nof systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical trials, with local practices taken\ninto consideration. The literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/Canadian Preventive\nServices Task Force Level of Evidence (2001). The writing of the CPG follows strictly\nthe requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. The draft\nwas finally presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the\nHTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

On the other hand, the prevalence of\nhypothyroidism is 2.1% (0.5% overt and 1.6% subclinical hypothyroidism). Except\nfor overt hyperthyroidism, the majority of subjects with thyroid dysfunction were\nnewly diagnosed. The proportion of those who were newly diagnosed with thyroid\ndysfunction was as high as 68%. Females were found to have a higher prevalence\nof thyroid dysfunction compared to their male counterparts (female: 4.1% vs. male:\n1.9% for hyperthyroidism and 2.6% vs. 1.2% for hypothyroidism).1\u00a0(Level III)\nThe same study looked at the prevalence of goitre and thyroid nodule. The\nprevalence of goitre and thyroid nodule in the Malaysian population is 9.3% and\n3.6%, respectively. Despite having an abnormality at the anterior neck, as high as\n62% of those with grade 2 goitre and 68% of those with thyroid nodule were newly\ndiagnosed. In the Malaysian population, there was a higher prevalence of goitre in\nthe Indian population and those aged less than 45 years. There was also a higher\nprevalence of goitre with positive thyroid antibodies in coastal and urban areas,\nindicating increased iodine exposure. On the other hand, there may also be pockets\nof iodine-deficient areas in rural regions, where a high prevalence of goitre was not\nassociated with positive thyroid antibodies.2 (Level III)\nThe prevalence of thyroid antibodies in the Malaysian population was 12.2% for\nanti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and 12.1% for anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG). Females have a higher prevalence of positive thyroid antibodies compared to\nmales (female: 15.2% vs. male: 3.0% for anti-TPO and 15.7% vs. 6.0% for anti-TG). Surprisingly, those with Indian ethnicity had a significantly higher prevalence of antiTPO compared from other ethnic groups. Coastal and urban regions reported a\nhigher prevalence of thyroid antibodies (as high as 16.1% for anti-TPO and 17.8% for\nanti-TG), supporting the possibility of higher iodine exposure in these areas.3 (Level III)\n2.

Its prevalence can be as high as 70%\u201384% in different countries.5,6 (Level III, II) Graves\u2019\ndisease occurs due to the presence of anti-TSH receptor antibodies. Yersinia\nenterocolitica infection has been associated with Graves\u2019 disease.7 (Level II) Other causes\nof primary hyperthyroidism include toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goitre. Genetic analysis of resected nodules revealed a mutation in the TSH receptor gene,\nwhich leads to basal activation of the protein kinase A pathway and increased\nT4 production and increased cellular proliferation. In addition, the mutation\nleads to increased TSH receptor affinity to TSH, thus increasing thyroid hormone\nsynthesis.8\u00a0 (Level II) Not all of these hot nodules are actually benign. Some may be\nmalignant, and further workout is necessary. The risk of malignancy in hot nodules\nmay be underestimated, and a literature review reported that a weighted rate of\n3.1% (0\u201312.5%) of hot nodules are graded as thyroid cancer.9(Level I) Thyroid papillary\ncarcinoma can cause hyperthyroidism.10 (Level III) Graves\u2019 disease can co-exist with toxic\nadenoma and is termed as Marine\u2013Lenhart syndrome.11 (Level III) And, finally, there is\na small group of patients with diffuse non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism due to a\ngenetic mutation leading to the production of thyroid hormone without any TSH\nligand.12 (Level III)\nB. \u0007Thyroid Stores Of Preformed Hormone Are Passively Released In Excessive\nAmounts Due To Autoimmune, Infective, Chemical, Or Physical Insults\nDestruction of the thyroid follicle cells can result in the hyperthyroid stage of any\nthyroiditis.

TSHoma, which is pituitary gland thyrotrophs adenoma secreting excessive\namounts of TSH leading to secondary hyperthyroidism is rare. Besides, gestational\ntrophoblastic disease, which secretes b-HCG (which has partial molecular similarity\nwith TSH) can lead to thyrotoxicosis. It is also rare, as only 2.0 per 1000 pregnancies\nhave gestational trophoblastic disease, of which only 7% have biochemical\nthyrotoxicosis.23 (Level III) Iodinated contrast materials are increasingly being used\nduring CT scans and angiographic procedures. Amiodarones are used frequently\nfor various types of tachyarrhythmia. The iodine content in radiographic contrast\nmaterials and amiodarone is much higher than the amount human beings actually\nrequire. This excess iodine will lead to Jod\u2013Basedow thyrotoxicosis.24, 25 (Level III)\nThe prevalence of contrast iodine-induced subclinical hyperthyroidism can reach\nup to 2.66%26, 27 (Level II) and contrast iodine-induced hyperthyroidism up to 1.7%.28,29\n(Level II,III) Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is more prevalent, and is in the range\nof 3.0%\u201320.8%.30, 31, 32, 33 (Level III) There are other rare case reports of thyrotoxicosis\nsuch as due to L-asparaginase chemotherapy, which leads to transient\nthyrotoxicosis.34 (Level III)\n2.1.2\u2002How To Diagnose Hyperthyroidism? 2.1.2.1\u2002Biochemical Evaluation For Diagnosis Of Hyperthyroidism\nSerum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity\nand specificity of any single blood test and is used as an initial screening test for\nhyperthyroidism.35 (Level III) However, diagnostic accuracy is improved when serum\nTSH and free T4 (fT4) are assessed at initial evaluation.

In selected patients with Graves\u2019 hyperthyroidism who would have\nbeen candidates for pretreatment with ATDs because of comorbidities or excessive\nsymptoms, but who are allergic to ATDs, the duration of hyperthyroidism may be\nshortened by administering iodine (e.g. saturated solution of potassium iodide\n[SSKI]) beginning a week after RAI administration.4 (Level II)\nThe goal of RAI therapy in GD is to control hyperthyroidism by rendering the patient\nhypothyroid; this treatment is very effective, provided a sufficient radiation dose\nis deposited in the thyroid. This outcome can be accomplished equally well by\neither administering a fixed dose or by calculating the activity based on the size of\nthe thyroid and its ability to trap RAI. The first method is simple, while the second\nmethod requires two unknowns to be determined: the uptake of RAI and the size of\nthe thyroid.4 (Level II)\nAnti-Thyroid Drugs (ATDs)\nThe goal of the therapy is to render the patient euthyroid as quickly and safely as\npossible. These medications do not cure Graves\u2019 hyperthyroidism; however, when\ngiven in adequate doses, they are very effective in controlling hyperthyroidism. When\nthey fail to achieve euthyroidism, the usual cause is nonadherence. The treatment\nitself might have a beneficial immunosuppressive role, either to primarily decrease\nthyroid-specific autoimmunity, or secondarily, by ameliorating the hyperthyroid\nstate, which may restore the dysregulated immune system back to normal. Carbimazole is rapidly converted to MMI in the serum (10 mg of carbimazole is\nmetabolised to approximately 6 mg of MMI). They work in an identical fashion, and\nboth are effective as a single daily dose. At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of\n10\u201330 mg daily are used to restore euthyroidism, and the dose can then be titrated\ndown to a maintenance level (generally 5\u201310 mg daily). The dose of MMI should be\ntargeted to the degree of thyroid dysfunction because too low dose will not restore\na euthyroid state in patients with severe disease and an excessive dose can cause\niatrogenic hypothyroidism in patients with mild disease. In addition, adverse drug\nreactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses. Thus, it is important to use\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n25\nan MMI dose that will achieve the clinical goal of normalisation of thyroid function\nreasonably rapidly while minimising adverse drug effects.

Methimazole has the benefit of once-a\u2013day administration and a reduced risk\nof major side effects compared to propylthiouracil (PTU). Propylthiouracil has a\nshorter duration of action and is usually administered two or three times daily,\nstarting with 50\u2013150 mg three times daily, depending on the severity of the\nhyperthyroidism. As clinical findings and thyroid function tests results return to\nnormal, a reduction to a maintenance PTU dose of 50 mg two or three times daily\nis usually possible. When more rapid biochemical control is needed in patients with\nsevere thyrotoxicosis, an initial split dose of MMI (e.g. 15 or 20 mg twice a day)\nmaybe more effective than a single daily dose because the duration of action of MMI\nmay be less than 24 hours.4 (Level II)\nThe adverse effects of ATDs can be divided into common, minor allergic side effects\nand rare but serious allergic/toxic events such as agranulocytosis, vasculitis, or\nhepatic damage.

Patients Post RAI\nMost patients respond to RAI therapy with a normalisation of thyroid function\ntests and improvement of clinical symptoms within 4\u20138 weeks. Hypothyroidism\nmay occur from four weeks onwards. This transition can occur rapidly, but\nmore commonly occurs between two and six months, and the timing of thyroid\nhormone replacement therapy should be determined by results of thyroid function\ntests, clinical symptoms, and physical examination. Transient hypothyroidism\nfollowing RAI therapy can rarely occur, with subsequent complete recovery of\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n29\nthyroid function or recurrent hyperthyroidism. In such patients, the thyroid gland\noften remains palpable. Beta-blockers that were instituted prior to RAI treatment should be tapered when\nfree T4 and free T3 have returned to the reference range. As free T4 and free T3\nimprove, ATDs can usually be tapered, which allows an assessment of the response\nto RAI. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism, which is indicated by a\nfree T4 below the normal range. At this point, levothyroxine should be instituted. TSH levels may not rise immediately with the development of hypothyroidism\nand should not be used initially to determine the need for levothyroxine. When\nthyroid hormone replacement is initiated, the dose should be adjusted based on\nan assessment of free T4. Overt hypothyroidism should be avoided, especially in\npatients with active GO.", "chunk_order": 23}

When\nthyroid hormone replacement is initiated, the dose should be adjusted based on\nan assessment of free T4. Overt hypothyroidism should be avoided, especially in\npatients with active GO. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is\nrecommended at least annually, or if the patient experiences symptoms of\nhypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Since TSH levels may remain suppressed for\na month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, the levels should be interpreted\ncautiously and only in concert with free T4 and free T3.4 (Level II)\nResponse to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland,\nthyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms. The goal of re-treatment is to\ncontrol hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid. Patients who have persistent, suppressed TSH with normal free T3 and free T4\nmay not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely for either\nrelapse or development of hypothyroidism. In the small percentage of patients\nwith hyperthyroidism refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be\nconsidered.4 (Level II)\nPatients Treated With ATD\nPeriodic clinical and biochemical evaluation of thyroid status in patients taking\nATDs is necessary, and it is essential that patients understand its importance. An\nassessment of serum free T4 and free T3 should be obtained about 2\u20136 weeks\nafter initiation of therapy, depending on the severity of the thyrotoxicosis, and the\ndose of medication should be adjusted accordingly. Serum T3 should be monitored\nbecause the serum free T4 levels may normalise despite persistent elevation of\nserum free T3. Serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months after starting\ntherapy, and it is therefore not a good parameter for monitoring therapy early in\nthe course. Once the patient is euthyroid, the dose of MMI can usually be decreased\nby 30%\u201350% and biochemical testing repeated in 4\u20136 weeks. Once euthyroid levels\nare achieved with the minimal dose of medication, clinical and laboratory evaluation\ncan be undertaken at intervals of 2\u20133 months.

Adjustment of levothyroxine dose may be necessary for the use of medications\nthat alter T4 metabolism or change the concentration of thyroxine-binding\nglobulin.91 (Level I) The need to increase the levothyroxine dose substantially has\nbeen reported in athyreotic patients prescribed tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as\nimatinib and sunitinib.90 (Level II)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Serum TSH should be reassessed at initiation or discontinuation of oestrogen and\nandrogens (may alter levothyroxine requirement), and at the commencement\nof agents (such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors) that can affect thyroxine\nmetabolism and thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine deiodination. Monitoring of\nserum TSH is also advisable when patients are started on drugs that have been\nshown to increase hepatic metabolism of T4 and T3, i.e. antiepileptics such as\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, or other medications such as\nrifampicin and sertraline\n3.1.7\u2002What Factors Determine The Levothyroxine Dose Required By A\nHypothyroid Patient For Reaching The Appropriate Serum TSH Goal?

Multiple factors need to be considered when initiating levothyroxine based on\nserum TSH levels and weight (full replacement of 1.6 \u00b5g/kg when serum TSH\nlevels are markedly elevated and lower doses of 25\u201350 \u00b5g/day in milder degrees\nof hypothyroidism).91 (Level I) Medications taken concurrently may affect the dose\nrequired as well.108 (Level I)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Levothyroxine replacement therapy can be started as an initial full replacement\nor as a partial replacement with gradual dose increments titrated using serum\nTSH as the goal. Dose adjustments should be made when there are significant\nchanges in body weight, and with pregnancy and ageing. Serum TSH should be\nreassessed 4\u20138 weeks after any dose adjustments\n3.1.9\u2002What Are The Potentially Deleterious Effects Of Excessive\nLevothyroxine? Overtreatment or iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis can result in atrial fibrillation and\naccelerated bone loss or osteoporosis. Therefore, thyroid hormone excess and\nsubnormal serum TSH level (especially values less than 0.1 mIU/L) should be\navoided, particularly in older people and postmenopausal women. (Refer to the section on subclinical hyperthyroidism and hyperthyroidism in the elderly.)\n3.1.10\u2002What Are The Potentially Deleterious Effects Of Inadequate\nLevothyroxine? Thyroid hormone deficiency can have detrimental effects on the serum lipid profile\nand result in the progression of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, adequate doses\nof levothyroxine should be given to normalise serum TSH levels, to minimise or\neliminate these effects. (Refer to the section on effects of subclinical hypothyroidism.)\n3.1.11\u2002What Is The Appropriate Management Of Perceived Allergy To The\nConstituents Of Levothyroxine Or Intolerance To Levothyroxine?

A randomised controlled trial showed that patients given a dose of 1.6 mg/kg/\nday produced fT4 that reached the upper part of the reference range, and it was\nassociated with lower body weight, lower BMI, lower cholesterol, and fewer clinical\nsigns of hypothyroidism, based on the Zulewski score. However, no differences\nin well-being and cognitive function were observed.112 (Level I) Growth hormone\nreplacement may result in the need to either initiate or increase the dose of\nlevothyroxine in patients with hypopituitarism.113 (Level II)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 The primary biochemical goal in patients with secondary hypothyroidism is to\nmaintain serum free thyroxine levels in the upper half of the reference range,\nbut the level may be reduced in older patients or those with comorbidities and\nthose at a higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess\n3.1.14\u2002What Approach Should Be Taken In Patients Treated For\nHypothyroidism Who Have Normal Serum TSH Values But Still Have\nUnresolved Symptoms? A prospective case-control study showed that women with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis\nsuffer from a high symptom load and that hypothyroidism is only a contributory\nfactor.114 (Level II) In addition, it has been shown that individuals referred for thyroid\ntesting by their primary care physicians had rates of psychological distress twice as\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n43\nhigh as the general population despite the fact that the rate of hypothyroidism was\nnot higher.115 (Level II)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Acknowledgement of the patients\u2019 symptoms and evaluation for alternative\ncauses is recommended\n3.1.15\u2002Is There An Unmet Need In L-T4\u2013Treated Patients With\nHypothyroidism?

However, correlations between TSH\nlevels and outcomes were not found.118 (Level II) The evidence suggests that despite\nnormal serum TSH levels, psychological distress, impaired well-being, and cognitive\ndisturbances occur more often in patients with hypothyroidism treated with\nlevothyroxine monotherapy than controls and that 5%\u201310% of patients treated with\nlevothyroxine monotherapy with normal serum TSH can have persistent symptoms\nrelated to the disease and therapy. 3.1.16\u2002Is There A Biological Rationale For Persistent Complaints In\nL-T4\u2013Treated Hypothyroid Patients? Two most common causes of hypothyroidism are Hashimoto\u2019s disease and\nthyroid ablation in Graves\u2019 disease, and therefore most hypothyroid patients have\nautoimmune thyroid disease. Autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with\nother autoimmune disorders, with rheumatoid arthritis being the most common\ncoexisting autoimmune disorder. Also, there are significantly increased relative risks\nfor almost all other autoimmune diseases (RR >10 for systemic lupus erythematosus,\nAddison\u2019s disease, pernicious anaemia, coeliac disease, and vitiligo). Due to the\nnonspecific nature of associated symptoms, many of these conditions may go\nunnoticed for a long time. Therefore, screening for other autoimmune diseases has\nbeen recommended for patients with autoimmune thyroid disease who present\nwith new or unresolving non-specific symptoms.119\u2013121 (Level II)\nPersistent symptoms despite normal serum TSH levels in patients with\nhypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine monotherapy have been suggested\nto be due to the patients\u2019 awareness of a chronic disease, thyroid autoimmunity\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n44\nindependent of thyroid function, and inadequacy of levothyroxine treatment to\nrestore physiological T4 and T3 concentrations in serum and tissues.122 (Level 1)\n3.1.17\u2002When Should Endocrinologists Be Involved In The Care Of Patients\nWith Hypothyroidism?

However, the ATA has provided\nrecommendations for this population of patients in its 2014 guidelines.91 (Level III)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Factors that should be taken into consideration for institution and adjustment\nof levothyroxine replacement include the degree of clinical and biochemical\nhypothyroidism, active comorbidities, and details of administration of\nlevothyroxine (e.g., dosage, timing, and other factors affecting absorption). 3.1.19 \u2002In Hospitalised But Not Critically Ill Patients Treated With\nLevothyroxine Replacement, What Formulation And Route Of\nAdministration Are Recommended? Recommendation\n\u2022 Oral administration of levothyroxine is recommended, but if this is not\nfeasible, other enteral routes can be used. However, if enteral administration\nis contraindicated (e.g. perforated viscus) or there are concerns of significant\nmalabsorption, then intravenous levothyroxine (at approximately 75% of oral\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n45\ndose, assuming enteral levothyroxine dose achieved euthyroidism) may be\nused till enteral absorption improves. 3.1.20\u2002In Hospitalised But Not Critically Ill Patients About To Be Treated With\nLevothyroxine, Should The Possibility Of Adrenal Insufficiency Be Excluded? Recommendation\n\u2022 The possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered and if there is\nsufficient clinical or biochemical evidence to consider this diagnosis, empiric\ntreatment should be provided. 3.2\u2002SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM\n3.2.1\u2002What Are The Causes Of Subclinical Hypothyroidism? The most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism is chronic autoimmune\nthyroiditis (Hashimoto\u2019s disease).124-126 (Level III) Less common causes include treated\nGraves\u2019 disease, TMNG and TA \u2013 radioactive iodine therapy, subtotal thyroidectomy,\nand antithyroid drugs (intermittent non-compliance); head and neck surgery;\nradiation therapy to the head, neck or chest area; iodine deficiency; untreated\nprimary adrenal insufficiency; medications: lithium, iodine, amiodarone; secondary\nhypothyroidism (hypopituitarism); idiopathic and congenital.124\u2013127 (Level III) Transient\nelevations of TSH may occur in subacute or painless thyroiditis, following the\nwithdrawal of L-thyroxine and during recovery from a significant non-thyroidal\nillness. Repeat measurements of TSH at two-to-three\u2013month intervals from the\ninitial finding of a raised TSH are reasonable.125 (Level III)\n3.2.2\u2002How To Diagnose Subclinical Hypothyroidism? Subclinical thyroid disease is a laboratory diagnosis.

Despite the clear biochemical pattern suggestive of mild hypothyroidism, few\npatients with SCHypo have typical hypothyroid symptoms. The only large study to\nsystematically investigate symptoms in patients with overt and SCHypo as compared\nto euthyroid controls is the Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence study. This large\nquestionnaire-based study conducted among 25,862 subjects reported a small but\nsignificant difference in symptoms between euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid\npatients. The main problems reported were drier skin, poorer memory, slower\nthinking, weaker muscles, greater tiredness, more muscle cramps, more feeling cold,\ndeeper and hoarser voice, puffier eyes, and more constipation in SCHypo.133\u00a0(Level IV)\nThe Troms\u00f6 study compared symptoms in 154 controls and 89 SCHypo subjects with\na TSH between 3.5 and 10.0 mIU/L using a similar panel of questions. Tiredness, but\nnone of the other symptoms, was significantly different between the groups.134 (Level IV)\nThese studies suggest that some patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do indeed\ndevelop clinical manifestations of mild thyroid failure. Patients with SCHypo have a high rate of progression to clinically overt\nhypothyroidism. In a prospective cohort study by Gerold Huber, Jean-Jacques\nStaub et al., 82 women with subclinical hypothyroidism underwent a follow-up\nfor a mean of 9.2 years.

On ultrasonography, detection rates of clinically in-apparent thyroid\nnodules of 20%\u201375% have been reported in the general population. Thyroid nodules\nare more common in elderly individuals, females, subjects from iodine-deficient\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n48\ngeographic areas, and those with a history of radiation exposure.147 (Level III) In autopsy\nstudies, thyroid nodules may be present in up to 50%\u201360% of all adults.148 (Level II)\n4.2 WHAT IS THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF THYROID NODULES/\nGOITRE? In general, thyroid nodules are usually not associated with abnormal thyroid\nhormone secretion. Therefore, affected patients do not have any symptoms or\nsigns of thyroid dysfunction and present with neck lump or swelling. About 70% of\npatients with sporadic nontoxic goitre complains of neck discomfort. Some patients\nhave concerns about cosmetic appearance and fear of possible malignancy. Large goitres may displace or compress the trachea, oesophagus, and neck vessels. There may be compressive symptoms and signs such as inspiratory stridor,\ndysphagia, or a choking sensation. Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve\ncan result in hoarseness of voice due to vocal cord paralysis, usually associated with\nthyroid malignancy. 4.3 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THYROID NODULES/GOITRE\nThe main objective of the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is to differentiate malignant\nlesions from benign conditions. Most nodules are asymptomatic and benign. The\ninitial evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule should include a complete history\nand physical examination.149 (Level III)\nHistorical features that favour benign disease are a family history of Hashimoto\u2019s\nthyroiditis, benign thyroid nodule/goitre, and symptoms of hypothyroidism/\nhyperthyroidism.", "chunk_order": 38}

Nodule characteristics include composition\n(solid/cystic proportion), echogenicity, shape if taller than wide, margins, and\npresence of echogenic profile.151 (Level III)\n4.4.1 How To Describe Ultrasound Findings For Thyroid Nodules? A structured assessment followed by a practical and standardised reporting\nformat with details of specific sonographic characteristics of thyroid nodules\nis necessary to standardise diagnosis, risk stratification and the subsequent\nmanagement decision. The American College of Radiology ACR TI-RADS 2017 structured reporting system is\nbest recommended as it is easy-to\u2013use, robust and reproducible and widely accepted\nby radiologists. This reporting system enables assessment of thyroid malignancy\nrisk and helps select patients for FNA and/or surgery, and may substantially reduce\nthe number of unnecessary invasive procedures. The structured reporting greatly\nfacilitates communication between radiologists and physicians, as well as between\npractitioners and patients. For patients with multiple nodules (\u22654) present, only the four highest scoring\nnodules, should be scored, reported, and followed up. Follow up shall be according\nto the highest grade TI-RADS nodule available. Other nodules are also reassessed\nwith ultrasound. Interval enlargement on follow up is significant if there is an\nincrease of 20% and 2 mm in two dimensions, or a 50% increase in volume. If the\nACR TI\u2011RADS level increases between scans, an interval scan the following year\nis again recommended. Ultrasound follow up of a thyroid nodule can be ceased\nafter 5\u00a0years if there is no increment in TI- RADS grade and size. Thus stability of\nthe nodule over that time span reliabily indicates that the nodule has a benign\ncharacteristic. 4.5 FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY (FNAB) OF THYROID NODULES\nFine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of thyroid nodules is the main technique for\ndiagnosing thyroid cancer; it has high sensitivity and specificity rates.

Several molecular panels aimed at\nincreasing the accuracy of preoperative cytological diagnosis of thyroid nodules are\ncommercially available. After consideration of clinical and US features, mutational\ntesting for BRAF or the seven-gene mutation marker panel (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC,\nPAX8/PPAR-Gamma) may be considered in nodules with cytological interpretation\nreporting suspicious of malignancy and guide surgical decision-making.151 (Level III)\n4.6 LABORATORY EVALUATION FOR THYROID NODULES\nA.

A. Radionuclide Scanning\nThyroid scintigraphy with technetium should be performed in patients with solitary\nthyroid nodule or multi-nodular goitre with low TSH levels.152 (Level III)\nB. CT and MRI\nIn patients with large goitres, conventional radiography of the neck and upper\nmediastinum should be used to determine tracheal compression. CT and MRI are\nuseful for evaluating invasion into surrounding structures or retrosternal extension\nor intrathoracic goitre. It is also recommended in evaluation of occult metastases in mediastinal and\nretropharyngeal regions in follow up cases of post thyroidectomy with elevation of\nserum thyroglobulin (Tg) level and negative sonographic finding. Other additional\nfunctions of CT and MR is to access other nodal sites that should not be neglected in\ncases of thyroid carcinoma .These are the lower paratracheal nodes in the superior\nmediastinum (level VII), and the retropharyngeal and retroesophageal groups which\nare difficult to access on ultrasound. 4.8 MANAGEMENT OF THYROID NODULES/GOITRE\n1. Observation and Monitoring\nPatients with small, asymptomatic goitres can be monitored by clinical examination\nand evaluated periodically with ultrasound measurements. Goitre growth can be\nvariable, and some patients have stable goitres for many years. 2. Thyroid Hormone Suppression Therapy\nRegression of sporadic nontoxic diffuse goitre following thyroxine suppression\ntherapy has been established in earlier studies.153\u2013154 (Level III) Nodular goitre and thyroid\nnodules are less responsive to thyroxine suppression therapy for size regression. A\nsubset of patients with younger age, smaller and recently diagnosed nodules are\nmore likely to respond to thyroid hormone suppression therapy.155 (Level III) With the\ndiscontinuation of therapy, thyroid nodules return to their pretreatment size, and\ntherefore size reduction may require continuous treatment.151 (Level III) Long-term\nthyroid hormone suppression therapy increases the risk of bone loss and cardiac\ntachyarrhythmia, especially in the elderly.

The decision to use aggressive treatment for patients with BWPS\n25\u201344 would depend on clinical judgement, weighing against the risk of adverse\nevents from therapy.4 (Level\u00a0III) Retrospective audits comparing the BWPS versus JTA\ngenerally show agreement between the two methods, but there was a tendency for\nunderdiagnosis with the JTA.159(Level III); 162 (Level III) If the clinician is unsure whether the\nsymptoms are due to thyroid storm or an underlying disease, symptoms should be\nregarded as due to thyroid storm. Although measurement of fT4, fT3, and TSH are\nrequired, these values may not correlate with the severity of clinical presentation. Recommendations\n\u2022 The diagnosis of thyroid storm is clinical. Both the BWPS and JTA diagnostic\ntools could be used to aid diagnosis, but we recommend the use of BWPS, as\nthis scoring tool is more sensitive\n\u2022 BWPS score \u226545 or TS1 is definitive of thyroid storm\n\u2022 BWPS score of 25\u201344 or TS2, clinical judgement to look for decompensation\nshould be used to diagnose thyroid storm\n5.1.2\u2002What Is The Anti-thyroid Drug Of Choice In Thyroid Storm? Early and aggressive multimodal therapy is required for resolution of thyroid storm. The treatment strategies for thyroid storm are aimed at:\na) Inhibiting synthesis and release of thyroid hormone\nb) Inhibiting peripheral action of thyroid hormone\nc) Reversing systemic decompensation\nd) Treating precipitating event\ne) Addressing definitive therapy\nHigh doses of propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole (MMI) are mainly targeted at\ninhibiting the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. The recommended dosing\nfor PTU is a loading of 500\u20131000 mg, then 250 mg four-hourly and, for MMI 60\u201380\nmg/day, a single dose or divided into two equal doses.4 (Level III) PTU is preferentially\nused in comparison to MMI in thyroid storm, as the latter has the added benefit of\ninhibiting type I deiodinase activity in the thyroid gland and other peripheral organs,\ntherefore reducing the conversion of T4 to T3.4 (Level III); 163 (Level III); 164 (Level III) T3 levels drop\nby 45% within one hour of PTU administration, but only about 10%\u201315% after\nstarting MMI.163 (Level III) However, the Japan nationwide survey indicated that there was\nno difference in outcomes between those treated with PTU vs. MMI.165 (Level III); 166\u00a0(Level III)\nMMI has the added benefit of less frequent dosing and less hepatotoxicity.167 (Level III)\nWith such large doses of ATD administered, monitoring for adverse events such as\nliver dysfunction, rash, and agranulocytosis should be carried out. CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n59\nRecommendations\n\u2022 High doses of PTU (500\u20131000 mg loading, then 250 mg, 4\u20136-hourly) should be\nused in thyroid storm.", "chunk_order": 47}

In the presence of contraindications, high doses of MMI\n(60\u201380 mg/day) can be used. \u2022 Upon improvement of thyroid storm, patients should be transitioned to MMI. 5.1.3\u2002Are Rectal Anti-thyroid Drugs Useful? In conditions where the absorption of oral PTU or MMI is compromised, such as in\nventilated patients or in those with conditions that impair absorption, rectal PTU or\nMMI can be used. The dose and frequency are similar to those for the oral route. (See guide to prepare rectal PTU in Table 11). The pharmacological levels of rectal\nand oral preparations are similar, and rectal antithyroids have been reported to\nresolve thyroid storm.168 (Level III); 169 (Level III); 170 (Level III); 171 (Level III)\nTable 11: Preparation of rectal PTU\nPTU enema: 400 mg of PTU in 90 mL of sterile water170 (Level II)\nPTU suppository: Polyethylene glycol base (200 mg of PTU in each)171 (Level III)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 In circumstances in which absorption is impaired, rectal preparations of PTU or\nMMI can be used\n5.1.4\u2002What Is The Role Of Beta-adrenergic Receptor Antagonists? Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists are key to control heart rate and inhibit\nother peripheral actions of thyroid hormones in thyroid storm. Preferentially\nb-blockers with the ability to inhibit type 1 deiodinase such as propranolol\n(60\u201380 mg/four-hourly) are used.4 (Level III) Caution should be exercised with patients\nin decompensated heart failure. Beta-blockers with selective b-1 blockade such as\nbisoprolol, landiolol, and esmolol infusion have more favourable cardiovascular\nbenefits in thyroid storm with significant cardiac compromise.166(Level III) If there\nare contraindications to b-blockers, such as in patients with bronchial asthma or\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardioselective calcium-channel\nblockers such as diltiazem160(Level III) or intravenous esmolol with shorter halflives and easier reversibility can be used in the intensive care setting to control\nheart rate.172(Level\u00a0 III) Intravenous esmolol infusions are given at a loading dose\nof 250\u2013500 mcg/kg, and thereafter at 50\u2013100 mcg/kg/min of infusion, which is\ntitrated to heart rate and blood pressure. In patients with atrial fibrillation,\ncardioversion should be considered after ruling out cardiac thrombosis if\nhaemodynamics are impaired.

Corticosteroids should be administered in thyroid storm to inhibit both thyroid\nhormone synthesis and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.174 (level III); 175 (level III)\nCorticosteroids are also given as prophylaxis for relative adrenal insufficiency\ncaused by a hypermetabolic state in thyroid storm.166 (level III) Large doses need to be\nused; dexamethasone (median dose \u2013 6 mg/day), hydrocortisone (300 mg/day), or\nprednisolone (25 mg/day) are recommended.4 (level III); 165 (level III) Intravenous forms are\npreferred when rapid action is desired or when there are concerns of gut absorption\nof glucocorticoids. With the improvement in clinical condition, doses should be\nreduced and tapered off to prevent adverse effects. Recommendation\n\u2022 High doses of glucocorticoids (IV hydrocortisone 100 mg, 6 hourly or\ndexamethasone 2 mg, 6 hourly) should be given in thyroid storm\n5.1.6\u2002What Is The Role Of Inorganic Iodide? Inorganic iodide (Lugol\u2019s iodine/saturated solution of potassium iodide, SSKI) can be\nused in thyroid storm to rapidly decrease T4 levels by inhibition of iodide oxidation\nand organification and inhibits release of thyroid hormone.161 (Level III); 176 (Level III); 177 (Level\u00a0III);\n178 (Level III) These agents must be used in combination with antithyroid drugs for rapid\nclinical improvement. Inorganic iodide can reduce thyroid hormone faster than\nsteroids or antithyroid drugs.161 (Level III) Recommended dose is 5 drops of Lugol\u2019s\niodine 6 hourly (6.25 mg iodine/drop) or 10 drops of Lugol\u2019s iodine 8 hourly.161 (Level III);\n4 (Level III) It is important to note that these agents should only be given at least after one\nhour of antithyroid drug administration, to prevent the use of iodine as a substrate\nfor thyroid hormone synthesis.178(Level III) After clinical improvement, the Lugol\u2019s iodine\nshould be tapered and stopped before the antithyroid. Lugol\u2019s iodine should not\nbe given beyond 10 days or else this would lead to escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff\nphenomenon. Patients known to be allergic to inorganic iodide containing drugs\nshould not be given these agents. Inorganic iodide may also be administered via\nrectal or nasogastric routes in critically ill patients. The solution should be diluted in\nwater or taken with bread to avoid mucosal irritation. CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n61\nRecommendation\n\u2022 5\u201310 drops of Lugols iodine 6\u20138 hourly for the first 10 days, should be given\nafter administration of antithyroid for rapid improvement of thyrotoxicosis in\nthyroid storm\n5.1.7\u2002What Is The Role Of Lithium/Cholecystographic Agents?", "chunk_order": 49}

Lithium can be used as an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate MMI\nor PTU and works by inhibiting release of thyroid hormone by thyroid gland\nthrough unknown mechanisms.179 (Level III); 180 (Level III) Recommended doses are lithium\n300\u00a0mg up to thrice daily. Adverse effects that need to be considered are lithium\ntoxicity and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Therefore, lithium levels should be\nmonitored to avoid toxicity. Cholestyramine has been used as an option to improve\nthyrotoxic state in thyroid storm by reducing enterohepatic recycling of thyroid\nhormones.181 (Level III); 182 (Level III); 183 (Level III) Recommended dose of cholestyramine is\n1\u20134 g/every 6 hourly. Recommendation\n\u2022 Lithium and cholestyramine can be used as adjunct treatment for thyroid\nstorm\n5.1.8\u2002What Is The Role Of Plasma Exchange? Total plasma exchange (TPE) is used in patients with severe thyroid storm,\nrapid clinical worsening or failure or contraindications to standard multimodal\ntherapy.4\u00a0 (Level III) Failure to standard therapy is considered when thyroid storm\nshows no improvement within 24\u201348 hours of standard multimodal therapy. Total plasma exchange removes thyroid hormones, antibodies, and circulating\ncytokines. Total plasma exchange with 40\u201350 mL/kg of replacement fluid has\ndemonstrated improved outcomes and resolution of thyroid storm and should\nbe continued until clinical improvements are noted.184 (Level III); 185 (Level III) fT4 and fT3\nshould be sampled before and after each session. Two types of replacement\ntherapy: fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or albumin have been used in TPE for\nthyroid storm. Although there is no randomised study to compare between\nthe two, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has been preferentially used because it contains\nthyroid binding globulin (TBG) that will better enhance removal of TBG bound\nthyroid hormones.166 (Level III) Continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) is sometimes used\nin parallel with TPE in haemodynamically compromised patients.166 (Level III)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 TPE (with FFP as fluid replacement) should be considered in severe/rapidly\ndeteriorating thyroid storm or with contraindications to standard multimodal\ntherapy\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n62\n5.1.9\u2002What Is The Role Of Other Supportive Therapy? Other supportive treatment would also be required in thyroid storm. These include\nintravenous fluids, respiratory support, and nutritional support. Cooling measures\nusing cooling blankets and with the use of acetaminophen is recommended. The use\nof salicylates should be avoided as these drugs displace bound thyroxine leading\nto further elevations of free thyroid hormone.4 (Level III); 166 (Level III) Infection should be\ntreated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, tailored to source of infection.", "chunk_order": 50}

Recommendation\n\u2022 The use of salicylates should be avoided as these drugs displace bound\nthyroxine leading to further elevations of free thyroid hormone\n5.1.10\u2002What Is The Role Of Early Definitive Therapy And Prevention? Definitive therapy needs to be considered in all patients presenting with thyroid\nstorm. Urgent or early thyroidectomy is an option in patients who have a\ncontraindication to antithyroid drugs, have a large goitre.186 (Level III); 187 (Level III) However,\nthese patients should be rendered close to euthyroid prior to surgery with methods\nsuch as TPE in order to minimise risk of thyroid storm. If radioactive iodine is\nconsidered and Lugol\u2019s iodine has been administered during thyroid storm, the RAI\nshould be deferred until about 3\u20134 months after.161 (Level III) Commonest precipitating\nfactor is non-compliance and patients therefore should be educated on this\naspect. Patients undergoing surgery or RAI should be rendered near euthyroid as\npossible prior to procedure or the procedures should be postponed to prevent\nthyroid storm. Recommendation\n\u2022 All patients with thyroid storm should have early definitive therapy with\nRAI. In\u00a0patients with large obstructing goitre, early thyroidectomy should be\nconsidered instead\n5.2\u2002 MYXOEDEMA COMA\n5.2.1\u2002How Is Myxoedema Coma Diagnosed? Myxoedema coma is a rare condition which is diagnosed clinically in patients\npresenting with hallmarks of reduced conscious level and hypothermia. Thyroid\nfunction test will be consistent with hypothyroidism. Other clinical features\nare hyponatremia and/or hypercapnia. It should be suspected especially in\npatients with history of hypothyroidism or with any cause for hypothyroidism. Other causes of reduced consciousness should also be excluded.188\u2013191 (Level III)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n63\nDiagnostic scoring systems have been designed but are not well validated as the\nincidence is low.189 (Level III)\n5.2.2\u2002What Are The Complications Of Myxoedema Coma?

Patients who have been diagnosed with myxoedema coma are critically ill and\nshould be nursed in intensive care wards. Absorption of oral medications may\nbe impaired and reduced in these patients due to multiple factors. Therefore,\nintravenous thyroxine is recommended by most authors.192 (Level II)-, 188, 198,\n190,\u00a0 91 (Level\u00a0 III) These patients may also have concurrent hypoadrenalism, thus\nintravenous hydrocortisone is recommended prior to commencement of thyroid\nhormones.188\u00a0 (Level III) Ideally a serum cortisol is taken prior to administration of\nintravenous hydrocortisone. Recommendations\n\u2022 Intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg stat then 100 mg 6\u20138 hourly should be\nadministered prior to levothyroxine\n\u2022 Initial intravenous levothyroxine of 200\u2013400 mcg followed by 1.6 mcg/kg/day\n(75% if administered intravenously) should be given thereafter. If intravenous\nlevothyroxine is not available, oral levothyroxine can be given as 500 mcg\nloading followed by maintenance dose\n\u2022 Intravenous liothyronine (when available) may be given in addition to thyroxine. Loading dose recommended is 5\u201320 mcg followed by 2.5\u201310 mcg every 8 hours\ntill patient regains consciousness\n5.2.4\u2002How Should Patients With Myxoedema Coma Be Monitored? Improvements can be seen within one week of treatment. As with all critically ill\npatients, multiorgan parameters should be monitored including mental status\ncardiovascular parameters, respiratory parameters, renal function, metabolic\nparameters (e.g. electrolytes). Thyroid function test can be monitored every 2 days.

Untreated hypothyroidism causes systemic hypometabolism. Potential complications of hypothyroidism include hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, hypoventilation, sensitivity to opioids, sedatives and anaesthesia, and myxoedema coma. Cardiovascular complications are increased in patients with overt hypothyroidism\nand similar risks have been reported in those with mild hypothyroidism.205 (Level II);\n206 (Level II) Subclinical hypothyroidism has also been found to be more common among\npatients with obstructive sleep apnoea; presence of which affects intubation and\nventilation.207 (Level II)\n5.4.3\u2002How Should Perioperative Hypothyroidism Be Managed? In observational studies, postoperative outcomes vary according to the degree\nof hypothyroidism. Patients with mild (subclinical hypothyroidism) and moderate\n(overt) hypothyroidism generally have few adverse effects.208 (Level II-2); 209 (Level II-3) Although\nthere is lack of data among these patients, those with severe hypothyroidism\n(myxoedema coma) should be considered high risk for surgery. Recommendations\n\u2022 In mild hypothyroidism i.e., those with subclinical hypothyroidism, surgery\nshould not be postponed\n\u2022 In moderate hypothyroidism i.e., overt hypothyroidism, urgent surgeries\nshould be undertaken without delays. In elective surgeries, it is recommended\nthat euthyroid state is restored before surgery\n\u2022 In severe hypothyroidism i.e., myxoedema coma, treatment with both T3 and\nT4 should be given prior to surgeries\n6.

Some studies reported\nthe presence of prodromal symptoms between 20% and 38.5%.211 (Level III); 212 (Level III) Only\nbetween 12.5% and 46.2% of patients with subacute thyroiditis reported fever.210\u00a0(Level III);\n213 (Level III); 214 (Level III) For the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis, painful thyroid swelling\nremained a prominent symptom and is taken as an important diagnostic criterion.210\n(Level III); 211 (Level III); 212 (Level III); 213 (Level III); 214 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 216 (Level III); 217 (Level III); 218 (Level III)\nPatients with subacute thyroiditis usually present during the thyrotoxic phase. The onset of disease is between one and two weeks. Typically, the hyperthyroid\nstate lasts for 2\u20133 weeks, peaks at 1 week after the onset, followed by a period\nof hypothyroidism which lasts for 6\u201312 weeks. Subsequently, euthyroid state\nensues.211\u00a0(Level III); 219 (Level III) Most of studies recorded moderate increase in thyroxine level\nwith suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone, while thyroid storm is rare. 210 (Level III);\n211 (Level III); 212 (Level III); 213 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 216 (Level III) A cross-sectional study comparing the\nthyroid function of patients with subacute thyroiditis and Graves\u2019 disease\ndemonstrates that the free tri-iodothyronine (fT3) to free thyroxine (fT4) was\nsignificantly lower in the former. An fT3/fT4 ratio of less than 0.3 has a sensitivity\nof 52.4% and specificity of 91.3% for destructive thyroiditis.220 (Level II) Apart from\nthyroxine and triiodothyronine, thyroglobulin levels are also elevated.213 (Level III);\n216 (Level III); 219 (Level III) The presence of thyroid antibodies in subacute thyroiditis varies\nfrom study to study (between 4% and 20%).214 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 217 (Level III) However,\noverall, the thyroid antibody titre in destructive thyroiditis is much lower compared\nfrom Graves\u2019 disease.219 (Level III);220 (Level II)\nRaised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is one of the important diagnostic\ncriteria.

A non-suggestive ultrasound within\n1\u00a0week of onset of illness should be repeated later\n6.1.2\u2002How Should Subacute Thyroiditis Be Managed? Management of subacute thyroiditis is limited by the rarity of the condition and\navailability of high-quality evidence. Most of the studies were observational\nretrospective.212 (Level III); 213 (Level III); 214 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 216 (Level III) Patients either receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids or expectant management. The American Thyroid Association recommends that NSAIDs are used for mild\ncases and prednisolone for severe ones.4 (Level III) Beta-blocker is used to alleviate\nsignificant thyroid symptoms.210 (Level III); 217 (Level III); 219 (Level III) In majority of cases, 90% of\npatients go into remission without any sequelae and only 10% went into permanent\nhypothyroidism requiring thyroxine replacement.210 (Level III), 219 (Level III)\nA non-randomised retrospective review of prednisolone vs. loxoprofen (NSAID) for\nthe treatment of subacute thyroiditis was done by Sato et al. (2016). The average\ndose of prednisolone given was 15 mg/day (range: 14\u201316 mg/day) vs. loxoprofen\n180 mg/day. They demonstrated that the time to normalisation of thyroid function\nwas quicker in the prednisolone group (22 vs. 32 days).213 (Level III) Similarly, Benbassat\net al.", "chunk_order": 55}

They demonstrated that the time to normalisation of thyroid function\nwas quicker in the prednisolone group (22 vs. 32 days).213 (Level III) Similarly, Benbassat\net al. reported that those who received steroid had faster remission compared with\nNSAIDs.215 (Level III)\nRecommendations\n\u2022 Beta-blocker can be used in patients with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis\n\u2022 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line therapy and should be\nused for patients with mild symptoms\n\u2022 Prednisolone should be used in patients who present with severe symptoms or\nfor those who do not respond to initial NSAID therapy\n6.1.3\u2002What Is The Dosage Of Steroid Used To Treat Subacute Thyroiditis? In a prospective non-randomised clinical trial, Kubota et al. demonstrated that\n15\u00a0mg/day of starting dose for prednisolone is an acceptable option for treatment of\nsubacute thyroiditis. The prednisolone dose was tapered 5 mg/day every 2\u00a0weeks. In cases with persistent pain or high C-reactive protein, the dose is extended or\nincreased up to 40 weeks of total treatment. Fifty percent of cases go into remission\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n68\nwithin 6 weeks and do not recur. Thirty percent require between 7 and 8 weeks,\nwhile 20% require more than 8 weeks to recover.222 (Level II) A retrospective study\ncomparing recurrent and non-recurrent subacute thyroiditis revealed that tapering\nprednisolone from 30 mg per day to 5 mg per day over a longer period (up to\n44\u00a0days) is associated with no recurrence.212 (Level III)\nAn experimental approach to the treatment of subacute thyroiditis is administration\nof a mixture of lidocaine and dexamethasone using insulin pen into the thyroid\ngland.223 (Level III) Although the study design is prospective with seemingly favourable\noutcome, due to its small number (n=36), further study would be needed to clarify\nits benefits and risks. Recommendation\n\u2022 A starting dose of 15 mg/day tapered to 5 mg/day every 2 weeks is\nrecommended. The duration of prednisolone may be prolonged in cases with\npersistent symptoms or raised ESR or CRP\n6.1.4\u2002How Long Should Patients With Subacute Thyroiditis Be Followed-up? Overall, from retrospective studies, the recurrent rate of subacute thyroiditis is\nextremely low over the longterm. In a retrospective cohort, the recurrence rate is\nonly 1.6% over a total of 13 years.211 (Level III) However, the recurrence rates are higher\nwithin the 1st year and tend to reduce over the years. In a retrospective review, the\nrecurrence rate was about 10% over a 5-year period of follow-up.214 (Level III) Another\nstudy reported a recurrence rate of 10% within 1 year, and 4% after more than a\nyear. The rate of hypothyroidism is as high as 34% in the first year and 15% after\n1\u00a0year.216 (Level III) Therefore, it would be sensible to have frequent follow-up within\nthe first 12 months, with reducing frequency over the next 5 years.", "chunk_order": 56}

Acute thyroiditis is a rare but life-threatening disorder. The clinical features of\nacute thyroiditis are quite similar to subacute thyroiditis but are of more severe\nintensity. Pain is a very prominent feature. Patients may also present with fever and\nlymphadenopathy. Local inflammation caused by the condition may contribute to\nupper airway obstruction. Patients may assume a posture to limit neck extension\nand fluctuance suggest the presence of abscess.217 (Level III)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n69\nIn general, patients with acute thyroiditis are euthyroid. However, there are case\nreports of patient with hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm.4 (Level III), 224 (Level III)\nDuring the acute inflammatory stage, ultrasound may not show a well demarcated\nhypoechoic lesion, but rather a diffuse hypoechoic area spread throughout the\nthyroid lobe which may cause erroneous diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis.217 (Level III);\n224(Level III) Only later, approximately 1 week, the abscess or well demarcated hypoechoic\nlesion would be obvious. Other modalities that can be used to demonstrate the\npresence of an abscess are CT scans and MRIs.217 (Level III); 4 (Level III); 224 (Level III); 225 (Level III)\nApart from demonstrating thyroid abscess, several authors emphasize the need to\nidentify pyriform sinus fistula which may contribute to recurrence.225 (Level III); 226 (Level III);\n227 (Level III) The pyriform sinus fistula may be identified using direct endoscopy, barium\noesophagography or CT scan.226(Level III)\nRecommendations\n\u2022 Acute thyroiditis should be suspected in all patients who present with painful\ngoitre\n\u2022 All patients with painful thyroid swelling should have thyroid function test done\nwhich includes free thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone\n\u2022 Ultrasound should be done in all patients with painful thyroid swelling to rule\nout acute/suppurative thyroiditis.

SPECIAL SITUATIONS\n7.1\u2002HYPOTHYROIDISM AND PREGNANCY\n7.1.1\u2002What Is The Definition Of Maternal Overt/Subclinical Hypothyroidism\n(OH/SCHypo)? Maternal Hypothyroidism is generally defined as the presence of an elevated\nserum TSH during pregnancy beyond the upper limit of the pregnancy-specific\nreference range. Overt maternal hypothyroidism is also characterised by a\ndecreased serum fT4 below the lower limit of the pregnancy specific reference\nrange while SCHypo is characterised by an isolated high TSH with fT4 within the\npregnancy-specific reference range. At present, serum TSH remains the main\ndeterminant used to guide treatment decisions and target. The difficulties lie in\nthe presence of substantial differences in the upper reference limits of pregnancy\nspecific reference range for TSH between populations which varies from 2.15 to\n4.68 mIU/L.228 (Level II) It is therefore recommended that each institution should establish\ntheir own pregnancy-specific reference intervals for each trimester of pregnancy\nusing the local population. If this is not available, an arbitrary level of 4 mIU/L can be\nused as the TSH upper reference limit.", "chunk_order": 58}

If this is not available, an arbitrary level of 4 mIU/L can be\nused as the TSH upper reference limit. This level represents a reduction of 0.5 mIU/L\nof the non-pregnant TSH upper reference limit for most assays.229 (Level II)\nRecommendations\n\u2022 Each institution should establish their own pregnancy specific reference\nintervals for each trimester of pregnancy using the local population\n\u2022 As there is no published data on the pregnancy specific reference range\nrepresentative of the Malaysian pregnant population, we recommend a TSH\nupper reference limit of 4 mIU/L\n7.1.2\u2002What Are the Prevalence And Common Causes of Maternal\nHypothyroidism? The prevalence of hypothyroidism in pregnancy ranges from 0.3% to 4.8%.230, 231 (Level\u00a0III);\n232 (Level II); 233 (Level III); 234,235,236 (Level II) The onset of the disease in pregnancy is rare.235 (Level\u00a0II)\nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism in pregnancy is chronic autoimmune\nthyroiditis (Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis).230, 231, 233 (Level III) Other causes include previous\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n71\nsurgery, radioiodine ablation, congenital hypothyroidism and rarely, lymphocytic\nhypophysitis.230, 233 (Level III) High pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is a significant\nrisk factor for hypothyroidism in pregnancy. 7.1.3 Is Maternal OH/SCHypo Associated With Adverse Maternal/\nFoetal Outcomes? See \u2018 Appendix 2\u2019. 7.1.4\u2002What Is The Impact Of TPO Ab Positivity on Euthyroid Women Or\nWomen With Subclinical Hypothyroidism In Pregnancy?

See \u2018 Appendix 2\u2019. 7.1.7\u2002What Is The TSH Goal If Levothyroxine Is Given At Preconception,\nDuring Pregnancy And Postpartum? A retrospective cohort study demonstrated an increased risk of miscarriage\nwith TSH above 2.5 mIU/L at first trimester among pregnant women initiated on\nLT4 before conception.266 (Level II) There was no clinical study to date specifically\nlooking at an optimal TSH goal in second or third trimester. Parallel to the\ntreatment of hypothyroidism in the general population, it is reasonable to target\nthe serum TSH in the lower half of the trimester specific pregnancy reference\nrange for the local population.229 (Level II) If this is not available, a TSH goal of not\nmore than 2.5 mIU/L should be achieved before conception and during the first\ntrimester. The TSH goal can be relaxed to 3.0 mIU/L in the second and third\ntrimester.230 (Level III) The TSH goal can be reverted to the normal reference range\nfor non-pregnant women after delivery, provided the patient is not immediately\nplanning for another conception.", "chunk_order": 59}

Recommendations\n\u2022 For hypothyroid women already treated with LT4 before conception, we\nrecommend a TSH goal of no more than 2.5 mIU/L before conception and\nduring the first trimester as the trimester specific reference range for Malaysian\npopulation is not available\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n72\n\u2022 During the second and third trimester, a TSH goal of 3.0 mIU/L or below can be\nadopted\n\u2022 The TSH goal can be reverted to the normal reference range for non-pregnant\nwomen after delivery\n7.1.8\u2002What Is The Levothyroxine Requirement During Pregnancy And\nPostpartum? How Should It Be Monitored? An increase in LT4 requirement occurs soon after conception at four to six weeks of\ngestation. The LT4 requirement gradually increases through mid-gestation between\n16\u201320 weeks and plateaus thereafter in the third trimester until delivery.267 (Level II)\nA retrospective observational study demonstrated a 45%\u201370% increment in LT4\ndosing at the end pregnancy for women who received LT4 before conception.268 (Level\u00a0II)\nAnother retrospective study demonstrated an increment of 13%\u201327% during the\nfirst trimester which further increased to 26%\u201351% by the second trimester with no\nsignificant further increase in the third trimester.269 (Level II) The percentage increment\nin LT4 requirement was generally higher for hypothyroidism post thyroidectomy or\nradioactive iodine compared to autoimmune thyroiditis.268 (Level II); 269 (Level II) A prospective\nRCT comparing two LT4 dosage increment strategies with increment of LT4 tablets\nby two tablets per week versus three tablets per week, i.e. 29% versus 43% in early\npregnancy showed that both strategies are equally effective in keeping the serum\nTSH within target, with the first strategy associated with a lower risk of overtreatment\nresulting in TSH suppression.270 (Level I) However, the target TSH in this study was up\nto 4.9 mIU/L, which is significantly higher than the pregnancy-specific TSH upper\nreference limit for most populations.228 (Level II) This study also showed that a thyroid\nfunction testing interval of four-weekly was able to detect more than 90% of all the\nabnormal values throughout pregnancy.270 (Level I) As the increased LT4 requirement\nduring gestation is due to the physiological requirement of an increased total body\nthyroxine pool during pregnancy, the LT4 dosing should be reduced to pre-pregnant\ndose upon delivery.", "chunk_order": 60}

A prospective RCT comparing the universal\nscreening versus case-finding approach for detection and treatment of thyroid\ndysfunction in pregnancy showed no difference in adverse outcomes.272 (Level I) Casefinding approach is thus recommended over universal approach for screening of\nmaternal hypothyroidism. The test of choice is TSH as it is the most sensitive test in\ndetection of hypothyroidism. Risk factors that have been shown to be associated with\nincreased risk of maternal hypothyroidism include history of thyroid dysfunction;\ngoitre; known thyroid antibody positivity; age at or above 30 years; type 1 diabetes\nor other autoimmune disorders; history of pregnancy loss or preterm delivery;\ninfertility; history of thyroid surgery or head and neck radiation; morbid obesity; use\nof lithium or amiodarone; recent administration of iodinated radiologic contrast;\nresiding in area of moderate-to\u2013severe iodine deficiency; family history of thyroid\ndisorders and two or more prior pregnancies.273 (Level II); 274 (Level II); 275 (Level II); 276 (Level II); 277 (Level II)\nRecommendations\nSee \u2018Appendix 2\u2019\n7.2\u2002HYPERTHYROIDISM AND PREGNANCY\n7.2.1\u2002What Is the Prevalence Of Hyperthyroidism In Pregnancy?

Among all children, euthyroid goitre is more common than\nhypothyroidism.52\u00a0(Level II-2) Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis (Hashitoxicosis)\nin general has a definitive resolution of hyperthyroidism in an average of eight\nmonths.318 (Level II-2) In patients with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis with euthyroidism, 64.8%\nremains euthyroid after 5 years. Predictive factors for future development of\nhypothyroidism are presence of goitre, elevated TPO antibodies, ATG antibodies,\nand progressive increase in TSH.318 (Level II-2)\nAn unusual outcome of Hashimoto\u2019s is the conversion to Graves\u2019 disease in 7%\nof children and adolescents, which is due to alteration in the biological activity of\nthe TSH receptor antibody from predominantly a TSH receptor-blocking antibody\nduring the hypothyroid phase to a thyroid-stimulating antibody when Graves\u2019\ndisease manifests.318 (Level II-2)\nIn Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis with subclinical hypothyroidism at the end of five-year\nfollow-up, 89.6% had thyroid dysfunction.

Attempts to minimise the RAI activity\nwill result in undertreatment and the possible need for additional RAI therapy and\nradiation exposure. The administered activity of RAI to patients with large goitres\nis high. The size of the gland may be underestimated, resulting in insufficient\nadministration of RAI activities. Therefore, surgery may be preferable to RAI in\nchildren with goitres larger than 80 g.4 (Level III)\nPhysicians at some centres administer a fixed dose to all children, whereas others\ncalculate the activity from estimation or direct measurement of gland size. To\nassess thyroid size, especially of a large gland, ultrasonography is recommended. There is a lack of data comparing outcomes of fixed versus calculated activities\nin children. Advantage of calculated versus fixed dosing is that it may be possible\nto use lower administered activities of RAI and, at the same time, assure that an\nadequate administered activity is given.

A threshold thyroid-stimulating\nhormone value (>6.35 mIU/L) exists for increased mortality in subclinical\nhypothyroidism.402 (Level II) Deleterious effect of SCHypo on CV events is less evident in\nmoderately older people (<70\u201375 years) and could vanish in the oldest old people\n(>80\u201385 years).399 (Level II)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n107\nHowever, a few studies did not show adverse effect of SCHypo.

Serum triiodothyronine (T3)\nconcentrations decrease by up to 30% within the first few weeks of therapy. Serum\nreverse T3 concentrations increase by 20% soon after the initiation of therapy. The serum TSH concentration usually rises slightly after the initiation of treatment\nand may exceed the upper limit of normal. After three to six months of therapy, a\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n109\nsteady state is reached in most patients who were euthyroid at baseline:serum TSH\nconcentration normalises, serum total T4, free T4 and reverse T3 concentrations\nremain slightly elevated or in the upper normal range and serum T3 concentrations\nremain in the low normal range.412 (Level I) Approximately 15%\u201320% of amiodaronetreated patients develop either thyrotoxicosis (amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis,\nAIT) or hypothyroidism (amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, AIH).413 (Level III); 414 (Level\u00a0III)\nThyroid dysfunction may occur at any time during amiodarone therapy, although\nAIH is frequently an early phenomenon when chronic autoimmune thyroiditis\npreexists. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis may develop early, late during\namiodarone treatment, or even many months after drug withdrawal, due to the\nslow release of amiodarone and its metabolites from the body stores. Occurrence\nof AIT between 5 and 16 months after stopping amiodarone has been reported. Thus, periodical monitoring of thyroid function is warranted even after amiodarone\ndiscontinuation.415 (Level III); 4 (Level III); 416 (Level III)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Monitor TFT before and 3\u20134 months after starting amiodarone and at\n3\u20136 months interval thereafter.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may develop in patients with underlying\nthyroid abnormalities (type 1) or in patients with apparently normal thyroid\nglands (type 2).411 (Level III) This disease (AIT) is characterised by suppressed TSH\nand elevated fT4 and/or fT3 levels. Type 1 AIT (AIT 1) is a form of iodine-induced\nhyperthyroidism caused by excessive, uncontrolled biosynthesis of thyroid hormone\nby autonomously functioning thyroid tissue in response to iodine load that typically\ndevelops in persons with underlying nodular goitre or latent Graves\u2019 disease.

Type\n2 AIT (AIT 2) is a destructive thyroiditis occurring in an otherwise substantially\nnormal thyroid gland. A mixed/indefinite type is also recognised where patients\nacquire an overlapping condition of both AIT 1 and AIT 2. Out of the two, AIT 2\nis more prevalent in iodine-sufficient areas and, in general, is the most frequent\nform of AIT.414 (Level III) Identification of the different subtypes of AIT is crucial because\nthis affects the therapeutic approach. Thyroid ultrasonography may be useful as it\nshows the presence or absence of a diffuse or a nodular goitre. Colour flow Doppler\nultrasound study of the thyroid is perhaps more reliable. In AIT 2, most cases are\ncharacterised by absent hypervascularity, whereas in AIT 1 they usually show\nan increased vascularity and blood flow velocity.414 (Level III) Nuclear imaging using\nthyroidal 131I uptake (RAIU) is another useful diagnostic tool. The results of RAIU\nare usually very low (<3%) in AIT 2 and low\u2013normal, normal, or even increased in AIT\n1. Other tracers such as 99m pertechnetate (99mTcO4) and 99mTcO4 2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) have also been used.414 (Level III); 413 (Level III)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n110\n8.1.3\u2002How Should Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis (AIT) Be Managed?

If amiodarone is withdrawn, the LT4 dose may need to be reduced to prevent\novertreatment, and in others LT4 may be discontinued, because AIH subsides in\nabout 50% of cases within 2\u20133 months.415 (Level III)\nRecommendation\n\u2022 LT4 treatment is recommended in all cases of overt AIH\n8.2\u2002OTHER DRUGS THAT CAUSE THYROID DISORDER\nInterferon-alfa, interleukin-2, lithium, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and checkpoint\ninhibitor immunotherapy may cause thyroid dysfunction. a) Interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1): IFN-a is mainly used in the treatment of hepatitis\u00a0C.

One small randomised controlled\ntrial in patients with active, moderate-to\u2013severe GO showed that rituximab (2000\u00a0mg\nand 500 mg) compared to IV GC (7.5g) significantly inactivated GO (100% versus\n69%, p<0.04). There was no disease reactivation with rituximab compared with\n31% with IV GC group (p=0.043).469 (Level I) In another small prospective, randomised,\ndouble-masked, placebo-controlled study, rituximab offered no additional benefits\nover placebo in patients with active, moderate-to\u2013severe GO.470 (Level I)\nWatchful monitoring may be indicated in some patients after GC treatment or\nwithdrawal.

There are multiple options for rehabilitative surgeries. 1. Decompression surgery: Minimally invasive approach is preferred. Decompressing\nsurgery aims to reduce intraocular pressure by enlarging the bony orbit with\ndifferent degrees of extension of medial/lateral orbital walls or removal of\nthe orbital floor. Fat excision via the inferolateral or inferomedial extraconal\ncompartments is another alternative. Orbital decompression can reduce\nexophthalmos, periorbital puffiness, and lid retraction as well as reduce the\nintraocular pressure and thereby relieve retro-orbital pain. This procedure can\nalso improve strabismus and cure postural visual obscuration in patients with\norbital and optic nerve microvasculopathy. Potential complications of orbital\ndecompression are new onset/worsening strabismus and globe dystopia.474(Level II)\n2. Strabismus/squint surgery: It aims to restore fusion in primary position avoiding\ndiplopia in downward gaze and to correct residual incomitances.475(Level II)\n3. Eyelid surgery: Medical therapies such as alpha-blocker eye drops or postganglia adrenergic blockers are not very effective or limited by side effects. Botulinum injection is effective but transient. There are many approaches to\nlid retraction surgeries (from mild to severe degree of upper lid retraction),\nsuch as sutureless mullerectomy, transconjuctival free en block recession of\nthe levator palpebrae superioris muscle and conjunctiva, or transcutaneous\nblepharotomy.474,476(Level II)\n4. Cosmetic periorbital surgeries in GO are not different from those used for the\nageing-related face.474(Level II)\nIf more than one surgical procedure is needed, the sequence should be orbital\ndecompression followed by squint surgery, and lastly lid surgery.474 (Level II)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n122\nTable 16: Recommendation for RAI with or without glucocorticoids\n(Adapted from 4 [Level III])\nRAI without\nglucocorticoids\nRAI with oral\nglucocorticoids\nNo GO, nonsmoker\nRecommend\nRecommend against\nNo GO, smoker\nInsufficient data to\nrecommend for and against\nInsufficient data to\nrecommend for and against\nGO present, active, and\nmild, risk factorsa absent\nAcceptableb\nAcceptableb\nGO present, active, and\nmild, risk factorsa present\nRecommend against\nRecommend\nGO present, active, and\nmoderate-to\u2013severe or\nsight threatening\nRecommend against\nRecommend against\nGO present, inactive\nRecommend\nRecommend against\naRisk factors are high TRab, smoking, active and progressive GO over the preceding 3 months. bThe decision to use concurrent glucocorticoids should be made after considering the risk\u2013benefit ratio for each\npatient.

Levothyroxine treatment for pregnant women with OH is highly recommended,\nalthough no prospective randomised control trial (RCT) has been conducted to\nprove its benefits. This is because of the numerous serious adverse maternal and\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS\n148\nfoetal outcomes associated with OH that have been demonstrated previously. It\nwould be unethical to withhold treatment in this population to perform an RCT. LT4 replacement in pregnancy is particularly essential in the first 18 to 20 weeks of\ngestation where foetal thyroid hormones depends largely on the placental transfer\nof maternal thyroxine. For maternal SCHypo, the benefits of LT4 treatment are not as clear-cut as OH.

LT4 replacement in pregnancy is particularly essential in the first 18 to 20 weeks of\ngestation where foetal thyroid hormones depends largely on the placental transfer\nof maternal thyroxine. For maternal SCHypo, the benefits of LT4 treatment are not as clear-cut as OH. While there have been many studies that demonstrated the associations of\nmaternal SCHypo with adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially pregnancy loss and\npreterm delivery, only a small number of studies demonstrated the benefits of LT4\ntreatment in this population. A prospective, non-randomised open-labelled study\non maternal SCHypo demonstrated that the increased risk of spontaneous abortion\namong SCHypo patients not given LT4 treatment compared to controls with normal\nTSH was eliminated with LT4 treatment.257 (Level II) A retrospective study on the United\nStates national cohort demonstrated significant risk reduction in pregnancy loss\nwith LT4 treatment among pregnant women with SCHypo when the serum TSH was\nimproved to less than 4.0 mIU/L.258 (Level II) Similarly, a meta-analysis of nine cohort\nstudies showed normalisation of an increased miscarriage risk associated with\nmaternal SCHypo upon LT4 treatment compared to that of euthyroid women.246\u00a0(Level\u00a0II)\nA recent randomised controlled trial showed that LT4 treatment reduced the risk\nof preterm delivery among a group of TPO Ab negative women with TSH above\n4\u00a0mIU/L.259 (Level I) However, no study has specifically assessed whether the presence\nof TPO Ab positivity will lower the serum TSH threshold in obtaining risk reduction\non miscarriage and preterm delivery.
