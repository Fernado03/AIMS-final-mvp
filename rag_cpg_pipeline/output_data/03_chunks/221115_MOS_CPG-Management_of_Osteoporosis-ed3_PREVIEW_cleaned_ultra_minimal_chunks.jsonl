The recommendation in this 3rd edition CPG supersedes the\nprevious Clinical Guidance on Management of Osteoporosis 2015. STATEMENT OF INTENT\nThese guidelines are meant for the clinical management of osteoporosis, based\non the best available evidence at the time of development. Adherence to the\nguidelines may not necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is responsible for the individualised management of\nhis/her patient based on the patient\u2019s presentation and management options\navailable locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines issued in June 2022 will be reviewed in 5 years (2027) or sooner,\nif new evidence become available.

Around one-quarter of those who have sustained\na hip fracture will not survive beyond 12 months. The International Osteoporosis\nFoundation has projected that more than half of all osteoporotic hip fractures will\noccur in Asia by the year 2050. Among the country states of the Asian Federation of\nOsteoporosis Societies, Malaysia is predicted to have the fastest increase of hip\nfractures over the coming three decades as we approach the status of an aged nation\nearlier than projected. Osteoporosis is a chronic disease closely linked with age. Despite its wide prevalence,\nosteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Its complication, fragility\nfractures, is a significant disease burden to the healthcare system and its resources. Hence, those at risk for osteoporosis should be screened to prevent the onset of a first\nosteoporotic fracture. In addition, those who have already sustained an osteoporotic\nfracture should receive the necessary treatment to prevent a recurrence, either with\neffective pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies. The 3rd Edition of the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for managing osteoporosis will\nreflect best practices and the latest evidence on the management of osteoporosis. It\nis a condition that crosses traditional speciality boundaries such as endocrinology,\nrheumatology, orthopaedics, geriatric medicine, family medicine, and rehabilitation. Healthcare professionals such as dietetics and pharmacy are critical in managing\nosteoporosis. This CPG will be a valuable resource for all healthcare professionals as it\ncovers all aspects of osteoporosis care from identification, diagnosis, risk stratification,\ntreatment, and fracture prevention.", "chunk_order": 0}

Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)\nPREFACE\nCHAIRPERSONS FOR THE CPG WRITING COMMITTEE\nWith the increasing proportion of older persons in the population, osteoporosis and\nosteoporotic fractures are growing public health problems worldwide as well as in\nMalaysia. Thus, to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with\nosteoporosis, it is important to treat patients early and effectively. We hope that this\npractical and evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of\nOsteoporosis will be useful in that respect. Since the last CPG revision in 2015, there have been conceptual changes in fracture\nrisk assessment as well as new therapeutic options available. Thus, it is timely that\nthe Malaysian Osteoporosis Society has taken the lead in getting the CPG updated to\nreflect what should be current best practice. Once again, a multi-speciality panel of\nexperts have come together to form the CPG Working Group, to thoroughly review the\nliterature and produce this latest edition. As with all CPGs, this is not intended to be a\nfully comprehensive textbook, but a practical guide for clinicians on the latest approach\nto the assessment, investigation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with osteoporosis,\ntaking into account the availability and accessibility of health care resources. We would like to thank all the members of the CPG Working Group for their valuable\ncontribution and the external reviewers for their helpful feedback. We hope that the\nCPG will be useful to all medical practitioners involved in the care of patients with\nosteoporosis.

Literature search was carried out at the following electronic databases: PUBMED,\nMedline, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and OVID. In addition,\nthe reference lists of relevant articles were searched to identify further studies. Reference was also made to the latest edition of other guidelines on the management\nof osteoporosis including the guidelines developed by the International Osteoporosis\nFoundation (IOF), European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis,\nOsteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO), International Society for Clinical\nDensitometry (ISCD), World Health Organization (WHO), and National Osteoporosis\nFoundation (NOF). Clinical questions were assigned to individual authors. All retrieved literature were\ncritically appraised, presented and discussed. The writing committee agreed with\nall statements and recommendations. Where the evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were derived by consensus of the committee. The articles were graded using the SIGN50 format that includes criteria for the levels of\nevidence and grades of recommendations. The draft guidelines as a whole were submitted for external review to experts in\nendocrinology, rheumatology, geriatrics, family medicine, general practice and a layperson. These guidelines were then presented to the Technical Advisory Committee\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Health Technology Assessment and Clinical\nPractice Guidelines Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for review and approval.

Similar to trends in many countries with increasing life expectancy, Malaysia is\nexpected to have a growing number of elderly individuals. The common sites of fracture\nare the spine, wrist and hip. Hip fractures are associated with high morbidity and a\nmortality rate of up to 20% in the first year. Majority of those who survive are disabled\nand only 25% will resume normal activities.2,3\nIn 1997, the incidence of hip fracture in Malaysia among individuals above 50 years of\nage was 90 per 100,000. There was a marked increase in the incidence among the older\nage group. The incidence of hip fracture is consistently higher in women (Table 1-1).4,5\nTable 1-1.

Chinese women accounted for 44.8% of hip fractures.4\nThe direct hospitalisation cost for hip fractures in 1997 is estimated at RM 22 million\nand it has been projected to increase to USD 125.4 million by 2050.6 This is a gross\nunderestimation of the total economic burden, as it does not take into account the\ncosts incurred for rehabilitation and long-term nursing care. Therefore, in an ageing\npopulation, the cost of treating hip fractures will escalate without appropriate\nintervention.4\nIt has been proven that an osteoporotic fracture begets another fracture.7 This simply\nmeans that if a patient has a fracture, the risk of getting a second osteoporotic fracture\nin the following year is more than double the general population.8 Hence, appropriate\nassessment and treatment after the first osteoporotic fracture is vital to prevent the\nsecond and subsequent fractures. To improve osteoporosis treatment and fracture\nprevention, the Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) has been started in hospitals in various\ncountries.

A fragility fracture is one that occurs after a fall from standing height or less. Hence, in\nthis situation, treatment should still be initiated. CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)\nSECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS\n3.2.2 Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement\nBMD measurement via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the femoral neck,\ntotal hip or lumbar spine remains the gold standard recommendation for the diagnosis\nof osteoporosis.13,16-18 All patients should have BMD at the lumbar spine (L1-L4, posteroanterior) and hip (to include the femoral neck or total hip) measured. Forearm BMD\n(1/3rd radius of the non-dominant forearm) should be measured when the hip and/or\nspine cannot be measured or interpreted, in patients with hyperparathyroidism, and/\nor in very obese patients (over the weight limit for the DXA table).19 BMD measurement\nis also used for determining fracture risk and treatment decisions (see Section 5.2 Risk\nstratification). BMD is reported as a T-score or Z-score, both of which are units of standard deviation\n(SD). T-score\nThe T-score represents the number of SDs by which an individual\u2019s BMD diverges\nfrom the mean value of young female adults.

If available, the use of country-specific fracture risk assessment should be a standard\ncomponent of investigation to evaluate bone health and predict future fracture and/\nor osteoporosis risk.24 In Malaysia, we can use FRAX\u00ae for fracture risk assessment, and/\nor the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) and MOST as osteoporosis\nscreening tools. Most of these tools were designed to be used in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis\nscreening tools to guide further investigation and management for men have been\ndeveloped as well. These include the Male Osteoporosis Risk Estimation Score,336 the\nOsteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Men337 and the Male Osteoporosis Screening\nTool.338 The Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool and the Male Osteoporosis Screening\nTool have been evaluated in a Chinese cohort338 demonstrating efficacy in ruling out\nosteoporosis.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nMANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS 2022 (3RD EDITION)\nSECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS\nBMD is not necessary for calculation of fracture probability. However, it improves the\nprediction of fracture probability. If a BMD is available, only the femoral neck BMD is\nto be used. BMD input from non-hip sites has not been validated with FRAX\u00ae and is,\ntherefore, not recommended.26\nThe treatment interventions in FRAX\u00ae have been partly based on cost-effectiveness,\nfor which there is no Malaysian data. Notwithstanding that, we would propose that in\npatients with osteopenia, initiation of treatment is recommended with a FRAX\u00ae (or if\navailable, trabecular bone score [TBS]-adjusted FRAX\u00ae) fracture probability of >3%\nat 10 years for hip or 20% at 10 years for major osteoporosis-related fracture.13\nFRAX\u00ae scores need to be adjusted for glucocorticoid usage \u2013 see Table 7-2.
