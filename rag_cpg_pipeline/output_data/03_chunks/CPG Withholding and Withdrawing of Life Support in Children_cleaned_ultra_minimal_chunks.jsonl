INTRODUCTION\nTechnological advances in modern medicine have had a great impact on the care of\ncritically ill patients, saving many children\u2019s lives, but also leaving others with chronic\ndiseases and disabilities. The increased ability to sustain life with intensive care\nmay lead, unfortunately, sometimes only to prolonging suffering when treatment is\nunsuccessful, and prolonging the dying process, attached to technology, instead of\ndying with dignity in the company of loved ones. Thus, with these new technologies\nalso comes the responsibility to understand how, when, and why these technologies\nare applied, and when technology should not be used or withdrawn. Professionals have a duty to act in their patients\u2019 best interests, to sustain life and\nrestore health to an acceptable standard (Chantler & Doyal, 2000, Level 9). However,\nit is important both from an ethical as well as an economic viewpoint, for these\nprofessionals to recognise the limits of unnecessary prolongation of life. Furthermore,\nrecognition that resources are finite, limit the provision of care that is deemed futile. The decision by a doctor to withhold or withdraw treatment, but not care, (please\nsee Appendix 1 for definition of terms) from a patient may result in a serious conflict\nwith a parent who insists otherwise. However, this may be ethically justifiable and\nlegally defensible under certain circumstances, since doctors are morally obliged to\nquestion if providing treatment is inconsistent with his professional ethics. The\ndecision to withhold or withdraw treatment can be made on the basis that treatment\nis contrary to the child\u2019s best interests, disproportionately burdensome, futile, or\neven harmful (Larcher & Hird 2002, Level 9; Schneiderman et al, 1996, Level 9). 2. METHODOLOGY\nA systematic search of the literature using PubMed, Proquest, Ovid, and Ebsco was\ncarried out. The key words used included withdrawal, withholding, limitation, lifesustaining therapy, life support, treatment, children, neonate, intensive care, paediatric\nintensive care, ethical, cost, and financial implication, used singly or in combination. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Evidence Based Medicine\nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews (DARE) were also searched. Additional literature\nsearch was carried out using the words nutrition and hydration. 3. REASONS FOR WITHDRAWAL/WITHOLDING LIFE SUPPORT\n3.1.

Neonates\nDecisions relating to the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining medical\ntreatments are a necessary part of a neonatal unit\u2019s practice (Larcher & Hird\n2002, Level 9). Many decisions regarding life support call for the use of \u2018best\ninterests\u2019 standard, involving weighing the benefits and burdens of lifesustaining medical treatment (please see Appendix 1 for the range of LSMT). The benefits include the following:\n\u2022\nProlongation of life (understanding that the continuation of biological\nexistence without consciousness may not be a benefit)\n\u2022\nImproved quality of life (including reduction of pain or disability)\n\u2022\nIncreased physical pleasure, emotional enjoyment and intellectual\nsatisfaction. The burden of life sustaining medical treatment (LSMT) may include the\nfollowing\n\u2022\nIntractable pain\n\u2022\nIrremediable disability or helplessness\n\u2022\nEmotional, psychosocial and economic suffering\n\u2022\nInvasive and/or inhumane interventions that severely detract from the\npatient\u2019s quality of life (i.e. experience of life as viewed by the patient,\nand not social worth as judged by others) (Meisel, 1989, Level 9)\n3.1.1. Labour room/ operation theatre\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation in the labour room presents clinicians with\nsignificant ethical issues. The resuscitation of critically ill infants is a difficult\nchoice and decision of whether to resuscitate or not must often be made\nrapidly. Generally, it is recommended that if there is any doubt, resuscitative\nefforts should be provided, since it allows time for increased prognostic\ncertainty and opportunity for joint decision-making (Meadow et al, 1996, Level 8). Resuscitation may be inappropriate for the following:\n\u2022\nExtremely low birth weight - gestation <23 weeks or birth weight\n<400gm\n\u2022\nNeonate with severe congenital defects e.g. anencephaly\n\u2022\nSevere perinatal asphyxia e.g. persistent asystole for >15 min. (Niermeyer et al 2000 Level 9; Goldsmith et al, 1996, Level 8)\n3.1.2. Neonatal Intensive Care Units\nIn UK, withdrawal of treatment accounts for up to 30% of neonatal intensive\ncare deaths (Wall & Partridge, 1997, Level 8). In USA, according to the Baby\nDoe regulations (1985) doctors must treat all infants with life-threatening\nconditions, except in the following situations (Lantos et al 1994, Level 8):\n\u2022\nInfant is chronically and irreversibly comatose\n\u2022\nProvision of treatment would merely prolong dying, not be effective in\nrelieving or correcting all the infant\u2019s life-threatening conditions, or otherwise\nbe futile in terms of survival of the infant (Lantos et al, 1994, Level 8)\n\u2022\nTreatment under such circumstances would be inhumane (Department\nof Health and Human Services, 1985, Level 9)\nDecisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining medical treatment have to\nbe based on careful assessments of the infant\u2019s clinical condition.", "chunk_order": 3}

Thus, while reasons for withholding or\nwithdrawal may vary, these will fall into the following 2 categories:\na. No chance for survival (Cook & Watchko, 1996, Level 8; Caniano et\nal 1995, Level 8) or continued treatment futile in the face of\nimminent death (Cuttini et al 2000, Level 8; Caniano et al 1995, Level 8)\n\u2022\nLimited life expectancy\n-\nEnd of treatment line-death inevitable (Kelly et al 1994, Level 8)\n-\nLesion incompatible with life (Kelly et al 1994, Level 8)\n-\nPoor chance of survival (Hazebroek et al 1993, Level\n8; Whitelaw,1986, Level 8)\n\u2022\nInevitable dependency on life-sustaining treatment\n-\nLesion will not allow meaningful survival (Kelly et al 1994, Level\n8) or poor prognosis for later life (Hazebroek et al 1993, Level 8)\n\u2022\nImpossibility that the infant would ever go home\n(daCosta et al 2002, Level 8 ; Van der Heide et al 1998, Level 9;\nWall & Partridge 1997, Level 8; Van der Heide et al. 1997,de\nLeeuw et al 1996, Level 8 ; Level 8 ; Lantos et al 1994, Level 8 )\nb.

CHILDREN\nMost deaths (65%) occur in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and these\ndeaths are mostly in children less than one year, with up to 50% having\nunderlying chronic disease (Martinot et al, 1995, Level 8; Levetown et al;\n1994, Level 7; Vernon et al, 1993, Level 8; Mink & Pollack, 1992)\n3.2.1. Medical factors\n\u0001\nClinical assessments should be based on whether each potentially\navailable treatment would benefit the patient, taking into account the\nresidual effect of any remaining medication or treatment on the patient. \u0001\nTreatment decisions must be based on the best available clinical\nevidence - guidelines should be consulted as part of the clinical\nassessment (where available), additional advice being sought where\nnecessary. \u0001\nActive treatment may be withheld or withdrawn, if unable to achieve\nits intended clinical goal, or the patient\u2019s imminent death is inevitable,\n\u0001\nWhere the patient has an existing condition, a management plan should\nbe formulated to anticipate progression of the disorder or cardiac arrest\n\u0001\nWhere the patient presents with a sudden or unexpected medical event,\nthe condition should be stabilized to allow proper assessment\n3.2.2. Futility of care\nWith patient autonomy, some patients and their families claim the right to receive\nany aggressive high tech medical interventions on a chance of improving\nsurvival, even if the medical provider judges the treatment to be futile. Futility refers to whether treatment will benefit an individual patient\n(Schneiderman et al, 1996, Level 9), and is an increasingly common\njustification for refusing to provide treatment requested (Prendergast 1995,\nLevel 9). Nelson (1995, Level 9) suggest that futile be restricted to judgments\nof \u201cstrict futility\u201d and to use disproportionate burden when a doctor judges\nthat the burden of continued treatment for the child far outweighs any expected\nbenefit. Strict futility or physiologic futility is when a certain treatment fails to preserve\na physiologic function vital for survival, resulting in imminent death e.g. the\nadministration of vasopressors that fails to maintain an adequate blood\npressure following a cardiac arrest.", "chunk_order": 5}

Strict futility or physiologic futility is when a certain treatment fails to preserve\na physiologic function vital for survival, resulting in imminent death e.g. the\nadministration of vasopressors that fails to maintain an adequate blood\npressure following a cardiac arrest. The doctor is not ethically or legally bound\nto offer or provide it, regardless of patient or parental wishes. Disproportionate burden involves value judgment about the benefits and\nburdens of continued treatment. Treatment will not benefit the patient, causes\npain and suffering, and does not contribute to restoring acceptable quality of\nlife, although the patient may survive for years. The doctor may be justified in\nrefusing to provide that treatment despite parental disagreement, but foregoing\ntreatment should not be the doctor\u2019s decision alone unless death is imminent. However, it has been shown that few paediatric intensive care beds were used\nfor futile care (Goh & Mok, 2001, Level 8; Sachdeva et al, 1996, Level 8). 4. INTENSIVE CARE IN THE CRITICALLY ILL CHILD\nInjudicious application of intensive care i.e. mechanical ventilation, dialysis and\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may create a clinical scenario in which a patient\ncan be maintained alive in an ICU setting with burdensome therapy, never entering\na conscious state, survive and be discharged home with an unacceptable quality of\nlife, or when therapy is failing, deprive another patient who has a chance of a more\nmeaningful survival if given access to the ICU. Some questions one should consider when making decisions on whether to admit a\ncritically ill patient with cancer to the ICU or to institute CPR are:\n1. Is there a chance of the disease being cured, controlled or put into remission,\nand a meaningful life? 2. Is autonomy of patient respected? 3. Is there distributive justice? Patient with the best chance of benefiting from\nintensive therapy should receive priority for admission. Australian Classification system for cancer provides a framework to discuss goals\nof care relative to cancer status (Meadow et al 1996, Level 9)\nAs healthcare costs continue to increase economic analysis will be necessary to\nguide resource allocation decisions. Cost effectiveness analysis is the most popular\nand it evaluates the effectiveness of one treatment versus another. In end-of-life\nissues the perspective needs to be broad and include all those who gain as well as\nthose who pay (ATS Bioethics Task Force 1997; Level 9). The value of the health consequence is usually reported as a quality of adjusted life\nyear (QALY). QALY is simply the weighted average of the value of a health related\nquality of life where death is 0 and optimum health is 1. This assumption may not\nhold true when considering terminally ill patients. 5.", "chunk_order": 6}

QALY is simply the weighted average of the value of a health related\nquality of life where death is 0 and optimum health is 1. This assumption may not\nhold true when considering terminally ill patients. 5. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS\nLegally and ethically, the decision to treat or not to treat is justifiable only when it is\nin the best interests of the child (please see Appendix 2 for details of rights of a\nchild). However, perceptions about the child\u2019s best interest may differ, and \u2018best\ninterest\u2019 may not be synonymous with prolongation of life. Those with parental responsibility for a child are legally and morally entitled to give\nor withhold consent to treatment, unless they conflict seriously with the interpretation\nof those providing care in the child\u2019s best interests. According to the Child Act 2001,\nparents can lose their rights and the child taken into protection, if parents object to\nthe child\u2019s needs to be examined, investigated or treated for the purpose of restoring\nor preserving his health. Although a child under 18 years of age with a sufficient\nlevel of competence and understanding can give valid consent to treatment, he/she\nhowever cannot refuse to have life saving treatment. In general, doctors judge the clinical factors, and parents determine best interests\nof the child. If there is a disagreement that cannot be resolved, a Court may determine\nwhether the provision of life-prolonging treatment would benefit the child. 6. ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS\n6.1. Cost Implications of End-of-Life Care\nIt has been shown that end-of-life care consumes 10-12% of all health care\nexpenditures. For terminally ill patients, significant cost savings can be achieved\nwith the use of hospice, and the lower use of high technology interventions. Initiation of renal support such as dialysis as well as CPR in critically ill patients\nhas been found not to be cost effective. The cost effectiveness of palliative\ntherapies is difficult to calculate since there is no good measure for valuing\nthe quality of death. 6.2. Care of Extremely Low Birth Weight Babies\nExtremely low birth weight (ELBW) babies require expensive and scarce\nresources, having poor prognosis for survival should they require intensive\ncare. Intensive care is costly and outcomes are often uncertain, and hence,\nrationing of these resources is inevitable.

Care of Extremely Low Birth Weight Babies\nExtremely low birth weight (ELBW) babies require expensive and scarce\nresources, having poor prognosis for survival should they require intensive\ncare. Intensive care is costly and outcomes are often uncertain, and hence,\nrationing of these resources is inevitable. Neonatal intensive care mortality\ndecreases as the birth weight increases, so that most NICU deaths occur\nduring the first few days leaving a relatively healthier population with greater\nlikelihood of survival (Meadow et al 1996, Level 9). Since premature ELBW\nbabies result in early deaths, the policy is to initiate treatment on most babies\nto see who will do well and who will develop life-threatening complications\n(Peabody 1996, Level 9). However, many studies have shown aggressive\ntreatment and surgical management of ELBW babies has poor outcome and\nis not cost effective (Young & Stevenenson 1990, Level 9; Civetta 1996, Level\n9; ATS Bioethics Task Force 1997, Level 9). Treating them over-vigorously\nviolates the moral principles of non-maleficence and distributive justice. Similarly, failing to treat vigorously due to concerns regarding non-maleficence\nand distributive justice could violate the principle of patient-centered\nbeneficence. Distributive justice compels the doctor to allocate finite resources\nequitably (Young & Stevenson 1990, Level 9; Pronovost & Angus 2001, Level 9). 7. WITHDRAWAL OR WITHHOLDING LIFE SUPPORT IN PRACTICE\nThe practical issues for withdrawal in neonates and children are similar in many\nrespects and will be discussed together, unless indicated otherwise! The term \u201cchild\u201d\ndesignates both neonates and children. 7.1\nThe decision to withdraw life support\nIn principle the decision on when to withdraw life support is made by the attending\nconsultant paediatrician with the assistance of the whole team (colleagues,\nmedical officers, nursing personnel) and in consultation with parents. 7.2\nPre-Withdrawal Preparation\n1. It is important that the decision to withdraw life support is a team effort\nin which the parents are fully involved. The decision should first be\ndiscussed with personnel involved in the care of the child. It should\nthen be discussed with the parents before a final decision is made. 2. If a parent (e.g. mother post LSCS) has not seen the child since\nadmission, attempts should be made for that parent to see the child\nbefore the actual withdrawal is done. 3. For continuity and trust, it is important that the attending team -\nconsultant paediatrician, medical officer and nurse be present to see\nthe parents through the whole process: pre-withdrawal, withdrawal\nand post-withdrawal counseling. 4. The attending consultant paediatrician (or most senior member of the team),\nmedical officer and nurse should discuss the following with the parents:\na. The timing of the procedure - the date and time of the actual withdrawal\nshould be decided by the parents (within reasonable limits). b. What the procedure entails - care should be taken to indicate how\nlong the breathing might continue, that the child may have gasping\nrespiration, that sedation may be used if the child in anyway\nappears to suffer. c.", "chunk_order": 8}

Who, if any, of the family members will be present with the child,\nduring the preparation of the child, during the switching off, and\nafter switching off. It may be meaningful in the grieving process for\nsiblings and grandparents to be present. d. Religious needs - at times parents may request a religious person\nto be present to pray for the child, or this spiritual role can be\nundertaken by anyone else like a staff member. 5. Establish the parents\u2019 preferences for the following:\na. Naming the child. b. Photographs - parents may wish to take photographs of the child\n(these can be taken at the time of withdrawal when the child is\nfully clothed or earlier). c. Hand and footprints, hair clippings etc (may be taken by the parents\nlater if they prefer). d. Holding the child during the dying process. e. Clothing the child. f. Post-mortem\n7.3\nWithdrawal Procedure\n1. The attending nurse prepares an empty cot, child\u2019s clothes, any\nprescribed sedation or analgesia. Photograph child before stopping\nventilator if desired. 2. Place screens around child and ask visitors to other babies to leave\nthe ventilation area. 3. The attending nurse prepares the child in the following manner:\na. Removing all invasive lines except the endotracheal tube. Just\nprior to this it may be wise to give sedation (e.g. a morphine purge\nto limit the trauma of gasping). Alternatively, it is possible to keep\none heparinised IV line in case of need for sedation. b. Cleaning any blood or fluid stains on skin if necessary. c. Changing nappy and dressing child in selected clothes. 4. Parents and designated family members can be present for this\nprocess or be waiting in a designated room. 5. Allow for time to pray \u2013 formal prayers by person designated by parents\nor by ward staff. 6. Designated person (preferably attending paediatrician or medical\nofficer) to stop ventilator and withdraw endotracheal tube. 7. The attending nurse to hand over the child to parents and family. At\ntimes it may be appropriate to wrap the newborn in a shawl so as to\ncover birth defects and present the child as best as possible. Place in\ncot and wheel to a private room with family (this may be a designated\n\u201cbereavement room\u201d, a counselling room or the room used for breast\nmilk expression)\n8. The attending nurse and doctor should do the following during the\ndying process:\na. Encourage parents to hold the child. b.", "chunk_order": 9}

Standby with parents if requested but it is generally preferred to\nallow them to be alone with child during the dying process. c. Check child and parents intermittently. d. Leave family with child for as long as they want but not for too long\na period. e. Provide tissues and refreshments as necessary. 7.4\nPost-Withdrawal Management (After Death)\n1. The attending nurse and doctor should express sympathy to parents. Some\nphysical contact may be meaningful (e.g. a hug or holding the hand). 2. The attending doctor to certify the death. 3. The attending nurse should explain the process of releasing the child\u2019s\ndead body. 4. Before the parents leave, the attending doctor should arrange a one\nweek appointment for parents with the attending consultant paediatrician\n(or neonatologist) to facilitate the grieving process. The primary focus\nof the follow- up is to help parents with the decision for withdrawal and\nassess/discuss any guilt feelings. In addition, there may be a need to\nre-discuss the diagnosis or provide more information from tests. 7.5\nEmotional Health of Staff\nThe withdrawal of life support is an emotionally traumatic experience. This is\ntrue even for local paediatric departments which have been practising this for\nyears. It is important that the nursing staff and doctors caring for these children\nhave opportunities to express their own pain and grief. This can be done\ninformally or having formal staff meetings for the purpose. 7. REFERENCES\nAirede KI (1991). Should we resuscitate? Ethical dilemmas. Ann Trop Paediatr.;\n11(2):169-74.

Appendix 1\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n1. Benefit versus burden of care: The primary goal of medical treatment is to\nbenefit the patient by restoring and maintaining the patient\u2019s health as far as\npossible, maximising benefit and minimising harm. However, sometimes the\ncourse of the disease may cause health professionals and the child\u2019s family\nto consider whether continued treatment truly represents the best option. If\ntreatment fails to provide a net benefit to the patient, it no longer becomes\nappropriate to prolong life at all costs, with no regard to its quality or the\nburdens of treatment. In such circumstances there is justification, ethically\nand legally, for withholding or withdrawing treatment.", "chunk_order": 13}

If\ntreatment fails to provide a net benefit to the patient, it no longer becomes\nappropriate to prolong life at all costs, with no regard to its quality or the\nburdens of treatment. In such circumstances there is justification, ethically\nand legally, for withholding or withdrawing treatment. The goal of medicine\nshould then shift to palliative care. 2. Withholding and withdrawing: The term \u201cforgo\u201d is synonymously used for\nboth stopping a treatment already begun (\u201cwithdraw\u201d) as well as not starting\na treatment (\u201cwithhold\u201d). Other terms include \u201climitation of treatment\u201d (Goh et\nal 1999). There is no important ethical or legal difference between withholding\nor withdrawing treatment when making decisions about an individual patient\n(AAP guidelines 1994). Yet, many health care professionals, as well as\nfamilies, feel an emotional difference between the two, largely due to the\nimpression that withdrawing treatment can be interpreted as \u201cgiving up on\nthe patient\u201d. Some health professionals may be reluctant to start treatment in\nthe mistaken belief that once started the treatment cannot be withdrawn. Treatment should never be withheld, especially when there is a chance the\npatient may benefit, simply because withholding is considered easier than\nwithdrawing. When great uncertainty prevails, a better course would be to\ninitiate treatment to ascertain whether it is able to benefit the patient, and\nsubsequently withdraw it if it proves unhelpful. 3. Life-sustaining medical treatment (LSMT): Other terms commonly used\ninclude \u201clife prolonging treatment\u201d and \u201clife support\u201d. It encompasses ALL\ninterventions that may prolong the life of the patient and postpone death. There is evidence that if these interventions are withdrawn or withheld, death\nusually ensues (Goh et al, 1999; and Wall et al, 1997) There is no difference\nbetween \u201cextraordinary\u201d (technically demanding and often scarce) and\n\u201cordinary\u201d interventions. However, in reality, health care professionals have\nmany preferences and biases regarding the type and order of withdrawal of\nsuch treatment. In light of these subconscious biases, it is useful to review\nthe wide range of LSMT and work towards an approach focusing on the unique\nsituation and needs of the patient rather than physician preferences.", "chunk_order": 14}

Artificial nutrition and hydration: refers specifically to those techniques for\nproviding nutrition or hydration that bypass the normal swallowing process. It\nis now accepted that providing nutrition and hydration via tube or intravenously\nconstitutes a medical treatment (AAP guidelines, 1994). Evidence suggests\nthat neither nutrition nor hydration in terminally ill patients increases the\ncomfort or quality of life, and may in fact exacerbate discomfort and suffering\n(American Dietetic Association, 2002). In these situations the goal is to provide\ncomfort, not adequate nutrition. Good practice should include moistening\ntheir mouths as necessary to keep them comfortable. There are three major\ncategories in which it is ethically permissible to forgo artificial nutrition in\nchildren: neurological devastation, irreversible total intestinal failure and\nimminent death from any cause (Nelson, 1995). However, it is recognized\nthat many health professionals and families are emotionally uncomfortable\nwith forgoing artificial nutrition and hydration, on the premise that feeding\nchildren is the most basic aspect of care. Discussions with the family about\nthe consequences of forgoing artificial nutrition and their beliefs and\npreferences are necessary. Informed and shared decision making is the best\nethical practice, but respect for the opinion of the family is paramount. 5.

Brain death: Denotes the irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain,\nincluding the brain stem. There should be no confusion over the concept and\ndefinition of brain death - a child who is brain dead is dead. It is a legally\ndefined state that does not require agreement or consent from the family\n(Report of Special Task Force (1987). Discontinuing technologic support for\na brain dead patient is not an issue, and is distinctly different from the issues\nof withdrawing or withholding LMST in a patient who has an extremely poor\nprognosis for survival but does not meet the criteria for brain death. 6. Palliative care: sometimes referred to as \u201cend of life care\u201d. When cure or\nrecovery is no longer possible, the focus must shift to ensuring that the patient\nhas a \u201cgood death\u201d, with relief from pain and suffering. Both humanistic and\ntechnical skills are required to ensure that the needs of the child and family\nare met. However, patients and their families do not suddenly switch from the\nhope of survival to the acceptance of death and pursuit of comfort. This process\noccurs gradually over varying periods of time, ranging from hours to weeks,\ndepending on the clinical situation. Similarly, forgoing LSMTs rarely happens\nall at once and is likewise a gradual process that parallels the shift in goals. It should be emphasized that palliative care and LSMT are not mutually\nexclusive options but rather coexistent. 7. Futility: comes from the Latin word futilis meaning leaky. In Greek mythology,\nAegyptus and Danaus were brothers. Aegyptus decided that his fifty sons\nwould marry Danaus\u2019 fifty daughters. Danaus, king of Argos, did not like the\nidea, so he told his daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding nights\nand supplied them with ruby tipped poisoned pins to stick into their hearts. All\nof the Danaides did so except one, who fell in love with her husband. The\ndaughters who obeyed their father were condemned by Hades to draw water\nin leaky sieves. Needless to say, their labours went for naught. The story\ncarries in all its fullness the meaning of the term, useless or incapable of\nbeing achieved, no matter how often repeated. 8. \u2018Forego\u2019 refers to both stopping a treatment already begun as well as not\nstarting a treatment. There is no important ethical or legal distinction between\nnot instituting a treatment and discontinuing treatment already initiated\nalthough many health care professionals feel reluctant to discontinue lifesustaining treatments (AAP guidelines, 1994).
