A search\nstrategy to cover all aspects on management of psoriasis was developed in the Medline\ndatabase and adapted to other databases. Search strategies were a combination of\nMeSH and keyword searches including abbreviations (refer to Appendix 1 on an\nexample of Search Strategy). Search was restricted to human studies; literature\npublished in English language and the last ten years. If the evidence was insufficient, the\nperiod of publication was extended for another ten years. In addition, the reference lists\nof all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from August 2011 till December 2012. Literature searches\nwere repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process. The\naim was to identify any further relevant papers published before 28 February 2013 to be\nincluded. Future CPG update will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The\ndetails of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to other CPGs on Psoriasis such as i) Guidelines on the treatment\nof psoriasis vulgaris by the German Society of Dermatology (2012), ii) The assessment\nand management of psoriasis by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence\n(NICE 2012), iii) Canadian Guidelines for the Management of Plaque Psoriasis by the\nCanadian Dermatology Association (2012), iv) Diagnosis and management of psoriasis\nand psoriatic arthritis in adults by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2010)\nand v) Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis by the\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology (2009). These CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. The Ministry of Health had published a\nProtocol for Biologic Intervention for Psoriasis (2011) and a Technology Review on Biologic\nfor Psoriasis (2011). This CPG incorporated recommendations from these two publications. A total of 25 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the\nDG were assigned individual questions within these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2) The DG\nmembers had met 21 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature\nretrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme\nMANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS\nchecklist, presented in evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the DG and\nRC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the\nDG and RC. These CPG are based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses\nand clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.", "chunk_order": 2}

The evidence used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive Services\nTask Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of recommendation was modified from\ngrades of recommendation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. On completion, the draft guidelines was sent for review by external reviewers. It was also\nposted on the MOH Malaysia official website for feedback from any interested parties.

It has been estimated to affect 1 - 3%\nof the general population worldwide. Plaque psoriasis, the most common form, seen in 80 - 90% of patients, is characterized\nby sharply demarcated erythematous plaques.1- 5, level III; 6, level II-2 Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)\noccurs in up to 50% of patients with psoriasis.7, level II-2 Although not usually life-threatening,\npsoriasis can be mentally and physically disabling. Patients not only have to deal with\ntheir highly visible skin disease, they also endure physical discomfort such as tightness,\npain, bleeding and itch. Studies have shown that psoriasis causes as much disability\nas other major medical diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension,\narthritis and depression.8- 9, level III\nFurthermore, several studies have shown that patients with psoriasis are more prone\nto cardiovascular disease, stroke, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.10 - 15, level\nII-2 The risk of developing these important co-morbidities such as myocardial infarction\n(MI) appears to correlate with severity of skin lesions. Young adults with severe psoriasis\nhave a 3-fold increased risk of developing MI and a reduction of 3 - 4 years in life\nexpectancy.10-11, level II-2; 14, level II-2 There is also increasing evidence that controlling chronic\ninflammation of psoriasis with systemic agents or biologics may reduce cardiovascular\nco-morbidity.12, level II-2; 15, level II-2, 16\nAlthough cure is not available, skin clearance can occur with appropriate treatment. Unfortunately, surveys showed that patients frequently received suboptimal care or were\non ineffective treatment for longer than neccessary.17-18, level III Hence, these guidelines are\ndeveloped to provide an evidence-based guidance to all health care providers involved\nin the care of adults with chronic plaque psoriasis. To ensure that all patients receive\nappropriate and adequate care, treatment goals and recommendations are clearly stated. 1.1 EPIDEMIOLOGY\nPsoriasis occurs worldwide.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND RISK FACTORS\n2.1 Clinical Characteristics\nPsoriasis is a common skin disease with several distinct clinical phenotypes. Besides the\npresence of skin lesions, most patients (80%) also have associated symptom such as\nskin pain (41.7%, 95% CI 31.8 to 50) and skin discomfort (36.7%, 95% CI 29.1 to 45).24,\nlevel II-2; 1, level III The most common symptom is desquamation (68%), followed by pruritus\n(41%),1, level III; 4, level III dry skin (40%) and erythema (30%).1, level III Although embarrassment\nfrom excessive desquamation and pruritus are common complaints, there is no study\ndocumenting the extent of physical discomfort suffered by psoriasis patients in Malaysia. Consistent with studies from other countries,1, level III; 24, level II-2; 25, level III plaque psoriasis is\nthe commonest type of psoriasis accounting for 85.3% of the 4445 patients registered\nin Malaysian Psoriasis Registry.", "chunk_order": 8}

Lower limbs (81.1%) is the commonest site affected, followed by scalp (80.4%), upper\nlimbs (76.8%), trunk (73.9%), nail (59.8%) and face/neck (50.1%). The commonest nail\nabnormality is pitting (71.5%).2, level III\nThe majority of Malaysian patients (76.4%) have mild psoriasis (Body Surface Area [BSA]\n\u226410%) while 23.6% have moderate-severe psoriasis (BSA >10%).

BSA involvement\nis widely used in daily clinical practice but it has not been validated.26, level III Psoriasis\nArea and Severity Index (PASI) is the gold standard to assess the physical severity of\nplaque-type psoriasis because it is the best validated tool with good internal consistency,\ngood intraobserver variation and acceptable interobserver variation.26-27, level III; 28, level II-2;\nPhysician Global Assessment (PGA) is another validated tool to assess physical severity\nwith good intraobserver and acceptable interobserver variation.27, level III\nPASI, PGA and BSA do not reflect the psychosocial impact of mild psoriasis located on\ncritical areas such as face, hands and genitalia. Short Form 36 (SF36), Dermatology Life\nQuality Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) are commonly used to measure the\nimpact of psoriasis on patient\u2019s quality of life (QoL). Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)\nis validated, concise and simple to use in clinical practice.28-29, level III Hence, assessing the\nseverity of psoriasis should include an objective evaluation of the disease extent and its\nimpact on the patient\u2019s health-related quality of life.

Patients should be given adequate information\nregarding their disease and current available treatment options. This information should\nbe reinforced by supplying them with evidence-based patient information leaflets in\nappropriate languages to enable them to make informed decision regarding their care. The goal of treatment is to improve and maintain patients\u2019 health-related quality of life\nthrough control of symptoms and signs of psoriasis. Implementing and regular monitoring\nof treatment goals based on disease severity and patients\u2019 preferences are necessary\nto ensure long-term effective treatment and to prevent complications from uncontrolled\ndisease activity. The choice of treatment should be individualised based on patient\u2019s\ndisease severity, patient\u2019s preference, availlability of treatment and the risk-benefit of\ntreatment (refer Appendix 3). \u2022\nManagement should start with patient education. \u2022\nTreatment should be a combined decision between patients and their healthcare providers. \u2022\nTreatment goals achieved should be monitored regularly to detect loss of response which\nmay necessitate modification of therapy. MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS\n4.2 Treatment Goals\nThe ideal treatment goal would be complete clearance of skin lesions but this is currently\nnot achievable in most patients. Thus, it is necessary to set a minimal target to allow\nmodification of therapy if target is not achieved within a set time. (Refer to Table 3). Treatment goal and minimal target set should be based on disease severity and patient\u2019s\npreference.

MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS\n4.3.1 Emollients\nEmollients either as soap substitutes or moisturizers are routinely used in the management\nof psoriasis although there is no evidence-based data on its benefits. However, one study\ndemonstrated its steroid-sparing effect when used in combination with betamethasone\ndipropionate where control is achieved with less steroid used.53, level I This steroid-sparing\neffect is probably due to the ability of emollients to restore normal hydration and epidermal\nbarrier function.

Calcipotriol causes more local adverse\nevents mainly irritation and pruritus compared to potent corticosteroids (RD=0.09, 95%\nCI 0.04 to 0.14). It is better tolerated than dithranol (RD= -0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.1)\nbut this needs to be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity among the\nstudies.

DLQI Scores Interpretation\n0 - 1\nNo effect at all on patient\u2019s life\n2 - 5\nSmall effect on patient\u2019s life\n6 - 10\nModerate effect on patient\u2019s life\n11 - 20\nVery large effect on patient\u2019s life\n21- 30\nExtremely large effect on patient\u2019s life\nMANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS VULGARIS\nDetailed analysis of the DLQI\nThe DLQI can be analysed under six headings as follows:\nSymptoms and feelings\nQuestions 1 and 2\nScore maximum 6\nDaily activities\nQuestions 3 and 4\nScore maximum 6\nLeisure\nQuestions 5 and 6\nScore maximum 6\nWork and School\nQuestion 7\nScore maximum 3\nPersonal relationships\nQuestions 8 and 9\nScore maximum 6\nTreatment\nQuestion 10\nScore maximum 3\nThe scores for each of these sections can also be expressed as a percentage of either\n6 or 3. Interpretation of incorrectly completed questionnaires\nThere is a very high success rate of accurate completion of the DLQI. However, sometimes\nsubjects do make mistakes. 1. If one question is left unanswered this is scored 0 and the scores are summed and\nexpressed as usual out of a maximum of 30. 2. If two or more questions are left unanswered the questionnaire is not scored. 3. If question 7 is answered \u2018yes\u2019 this is scored 3. If question 7 is answered \u2018no\u2019 or\n\u2018not relevant\u2019 but then either \u2018a lot\u2019 or \u2018a little\u2019 is ticked this is then scored 2 or 1. 4. If two or more response options are ticked, the response option with the highest\nscore should be recorded. 5. If there is a response between two tick boxes, the lower of the two score options\nshould be recorded. 6. If one item is missing from a two- item subscale that subscale should not be\nscored.", "chunk_order": 57}
