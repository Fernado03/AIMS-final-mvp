MANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n1\nSTATEMENT OF INTENT\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThis Guidelines was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the\nmanagement of Non- ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS). This is\na combination of both Unstable Angina (UA) and Non-ST Elevation Myocardial\nInfarction (NSTEMI). It is based on the best evidence currently available. Adherence\nto this Guidelines does not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual\npatient care. Thus, every health care provider is responsible for the management of\nhis/her unique patient, based on the clinical presentation and management options\navailable locally. This Guidelines was issued in 2021 and will be reviewed in 2026 or earlier if\nimportant new evidence becomes available. CPG SECRETARIAT\nHealth Technology Assessment Unit\nMedical Development Division\nLevel 4, Block EI, Parcel E\nGovernment Offices Complex\n62590 Putrajaya, Malaysia\nAvailable on the following websites:\nhttp://www.malaysianheart.org\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadmed.org.my\nThis is an update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines on UA/NSTEMI (published 2002\nand 2011) It supersedes the previous CPGs on UA/NSTEMI (2002, 2011). MANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n2\nNon-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome\n(NSTE-ACS) accounted for 55.4% of all Acute Coronary\nSyndrome (ACS) reported from the National Cardiovascular\nDisease Database (NCVD) - ACS Registry between 2016 and\n2017. NSTE-ACS including the non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina\nis the dominant clinical manifestation of ACS in Malaysia hence ensuring the standardised\nand current clinical management for our clinicians is paramount for the safety of our patients. A multi-pronged approach has seen improvement in the management of ACS over the last\ndecade, in line with the development of both treatments and healthcare service delivery. However, since the publication of the previous Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the\nmanagement of NSTE-ACS in 2011, new diagnostic and therapeutic measures have been\nintroduced and practised. Therefore, the publication of the refreshed version of the 2021\nThird Edition Clinical Practice Guideline on the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial\nInfarction is timely.", "chunk_order": 0}

Amongst the areas of focus in this brand-new CPG would be the in pre-hospital care, the\nuse of cardiac troponins in the diagnostic work-up, a greater emphasis on risk stratification\nscores early in the inpatient management, and also the recommendation of an early\ninvasive strategy for patients at the highest risk of adverse outcomes. I am delighted with the research contribution by the various clinical and academic groups\nfor the reference in this CPG, and I encourage such endeavours to continue for the\nimprovement in both care and outcomes in patients. This CPG complements others that\nfocus on the risk factors associated with the condition, including its sister condition,\nST-elevation ACS in the CPG STEMI, 2019.

Data from our\nNational Cardiovascular Disease Database - Acute Coronary Syndrome\n(NCVD-ACS) Registry showed that the in-hospital, one month and 1-year mortality\nfollowing NSTE-ACS is higher than that of other international registries. Thus, an\nupdate to our 2011 Clinical Practice Guidelines is timely. This CPG consists of statements that include recommendations intended to optimize\npatient care guided by a systematic review of evidence and assessment of the\nbenefits and harms of alternative care options, reflecting the latest literature, expert\nconsensus, and wherever possible, public stakeholder comment. This Guidelines has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the\nNational Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The\ncommittee members were multidisciplinary and comprised cardiologists, internal,\nemergency and family medicine specialists and cardiac rehabilitation physicians\nfrom the government, private sector and universities. The external reviewers were\nalso multidisciplinary and in addition to specialists, general practitioners were also\nincluded. Stakeholders - members of the general public - were also included as\nexternal reviewers. The committee made use of the following resources in developing this CPG :-\n\uf06c American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association\n(2010) Methodology manual and policies from the ACCF/AHA Task Force on\nPractice Guidelines\n\uf06c European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Governing Policies and Procedures for\nthe Writing of ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines and\n\uf06c the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation [ AGREE II ] Tool\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this Guidelines are to provide guidance on:\n\uf06c Systematic evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain to the Emergency\nDepartment to reduce the number of \u201cmissed Myocardial Infarctions\u201d.", "chunk_order": 3}

MANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n10\nProcess:\nA review was carried out of the medical literature on Myocardial Infarction (MI)/Non\nST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome / Non ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI) / Unstable\nAngina (UA)/Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) published since the issuing of the\nlast CPG in 2011. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases - PubMed\nand Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was conducted for the\nperiod 2011 till 31st August 2019. The following MeSH terms or free text terms were\nused either singly or in combination:\n\u201cAcute Coronary Syndrome\u201d,\u201dACS\u201d, \u201cMyocardial infarction (MI)\u201d; \u201cNSTEMI\u201d; Non ST\nElevation Myocardial Infarction;\u201d \u201cUA\u201d,\u201d Unstable Angina\u201d,\u201dNon ST Elevation Acute\nCoronary syndrome\u201d, \u201cNSTE-ACS\u201d \u201cdefinition of MI\u201d; \u201cMyocardial injury\u201d, \u201cECG\ncriteria of NSTE-ACS\u201d,\u201dRule out Protocols for ACS\u201d; \u201cRisk Scores for ACS\u201d, \u201ccardiac\ntroponins\u201d, \u201cPre-hospital Management of ACS\u201d; \u201cOxygen therapy in ACS\u201d; \u201cRisk\nstratification scores in NSTE-ACS\u201d; \u201cCardiac rehabilitation\u201d, \u201csecondary prevention\npost NSTE-ACS\u201d, \u201cmanagement of NSTE-ACS in women, the elderly, persons with\nchronic renal disease.\u201d\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and\npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from\nthis huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were\nsearched to identify further studies. Regional CPGs were also studied. Experts in the\nfield were also contacted to obtain further information. International Guidelines\nmainly that from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart\nAssociation (ACCF/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used\nas references. The literature retrieved was appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all\nstatements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The\nsystemic reviews were conducted \u201cin-house\u201d and the committee appraised the\nquality of evidence collectively. The evidence was not systematically assessed for\nconsistency, precision and directness. However, each of these attributes were\nimplicitly judged when the committee appraised and graded the evidence and wrote\nthe level of recommendation. The recommendations of the other international bodies\n\u2013 ACCF/ACC, ESC and The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\n(NICE) Guidelines-were also studied to determine their applicability to the local\npopulation and heathcare. The grading of the evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG as\noutlined in page 16, were adopted from that used by the American College of\nMANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n11\nCardiology Foundation/ American Heart Association 2010 Methodology Manual and\nPolicies by the ACCF/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the European\nSociety of Cardiology Governing Policies and Procedures for Writing ESC Clinical\nPractice Guidelines 2017.", "chunk_order": 4}

This should\npreferably be lab-based (depending on volume) or at least point of care (POC)\nkits. Cardiac troponins should replace the measurement of \u201ccardiac enzymes\u201d-\nlactate dehydrogenase, transaminases and creatine kinase. \uf06c Most of the medications that are recommended in this Guidelines are already\npresent in the Malaysian standard drug formulary. \uf06c Very high risk/high risk patients should be identified early and transferred to\nhospitals with existing catheterization facilities. In accordance with the national\nhealth plan, the ministry has already proposed the setting up of catheterization\nlaboratories in most of the state hospitals.

MANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n23\nSUMMARY\nEpidemiology:\n\uf06c Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) remains the principal cause of death in Malaysia. \uf06c The Malaysian NCVD-ACS registry 2016-2017 showed that our local in-hospital,\n30-day and 1-year mortality remain high despite being on a downward trend. Our\nfigures are higher than those in other international registries. (Table 4, page 39)\nDefinition:\n\uf06c Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a clinical spectrum of IHD that develops\nbecause of an acute imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. \uf06c Depending upon the acuteness of onset and the degree of coronary occlusion, it\ncan range from (Flowchart 3, page 37) :\n\uf0d8 Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS). This is a combination of:\n\u2022 Unstable angina (UA) and\n\u2022 Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\n\uf0d8 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n\uf06c In UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac biomarkers (troponins-cTn) are\nnormal. \uf06c Myocardial injury results in cell necrosis and cardiac biomarkers are raised. It\nmay be due to severe ischemia and/or non ischemic causes (eg myocarditis). \uf06c Myocardial Infarction (MI) is myocardial injury due to ischemia. \uf06c According to the 4th Universal definition, MI is diagnosed when there is a significant\nrise and/or fall in cTn, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper\nreference limit (URL), and accompanied with at least one of the following:\n\uf0d8 Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin of > 30 minutes. \uf0d8 ECG changes of ischemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q\nwaves. \uf0d8 Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion\nabnormality. \uf0d8 Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy. \uf06c There are no clear guidelines as to \u201csignificant rise and fall\u201d of cTn levels. An expert\nconsensus committee has suggested that changes in cTn concentrations of >20%\nshould be used to define patients with an MI. \uf06c MI may be STEMI or NSTE-ACS based on the ECG. Pathogenesis:\n\uf06c MI can be classified as 5 types depending on the pathology, clinical features,\nprognosis and treatment strategies. (Table 6, page 41) This CPG focuses on\nNSTE-ACS which is usually either:\n\uf0d8 Type 1 MI (spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, with\nulceration, fissuring, erosion or dissection) or\nMANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n24\n\uf0d8 Type 2 MI (often due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or\ndemand.

It may occur in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis without\nplaque rupture or in the absence of atherosclerosis). This is an important cause\nof ACS in the elderly. \uf06c The majority (66%-78%) of ACS arise from lesions with <50% stenosis and less\nthan 5% arise from lesions exhibiting >70% stenosis. Diagnosis:\n\uf06c The combinations of history, physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG)\nare important but may be insufficient to reliably rule in or rule out NSTE-ACS. \uf06c Cardiac troponins (cTn) T and I are the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for\nmyocardial injury and necrosis. \uf06c Troponins are raised due to myocardial injury and this may be acute (associated\nwith a rise and fall) or chronic. There are other causes of a raised cTn besides MI. (Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94). \uf06c For a diagnosis of MI, the rise and fall of cTn should be accompanied by either a\nclinical history consistent with MI or with ECG or echocardiographic changes\nconsistent with an MI or an intracoronary thrombus. (Section 2, pages 44 - 47)\n\uf06c The cTn assays could be point of care (POC) kits or laboratory based. In general,\nPOC kits have lower analytical sensitivity and too wide coefficient of variation (CoV)\nto detect troponins at the 99th URL. Almost all locally available laboratory-based\nassays can measure cTn at the 99th URL.

Revascularization\n\uf06c The selection of the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography and revascu\nlarization should be guided by the individual\u2019s risk for a MACE. \uf06c Risk stratification can be done using clinical features (Table 3, page 39),TIMI or\nGRACE scores (Appendix IV & V, pages 96 & 97). \uf06c Patients at:\n\uf0d8 very high-risk should undergo an immediate invasive strategy (<2 h). \uf0d8 high risk should be recommended for an early invasive strategy (<24 h). \uf0d8 intermediate risk - also recommended to undergo an invasive strategy but this\nmay be delayed for a maximum of 72 h window period from admission to\ncoronary angiography. \uf06c Low risk patients should be assessed non-invasively for ischemia. (Flowchart 2,\npage 36). If symptoms and/or myocardial ischemia are present, they should be\nconsidered for an invasive coronary angiogram with view to revascularization. \uf06c Wherever possible, complete revascularization should be performed either at the\ninitial setting or as a staged procedure.

(Table 4, page 39)\nACS is a clinical spectrum of IHD that develops because of an imbalance between\nmyocardial oxygen demand and supply. It is usually due to a reduction in supply.

This is a combination of:\n\uf0d8 Unstable angina (UA) and\n\uf0d8 Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\n\uf06c ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\nThe pathology is dynamic. A patient presenting with UA may progress to NSTEMI or\neven STEMI. 2.1 Unstable Angina\nPatients with UA are a heterogenous group. According to Braunwald\u2019s classification,\nupdated in 2000, UA may be classified as (Appendix I, page 93)9 :\nI. New onset of severe angina or accelerated angina; no rest pain\nII. Angina at rest, subacute - Angina at rest within past month but not within\npreceding 48 hours. III. Angina at rest, acute - Angina at rest within 48 hours\nIt may be further classified according to clinical circumstances into either :\nA) Secondary - develops in the presence of extracardiac disease\nB) Primary - develops in the absence of extracardiac disease\nC) Post-infarct - develops within 2 weeks of an acute MI\nIn UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac biomarkers (troponins-cTn) are\nnormal. In myocardial injury, cardiac biomarkers are raised. 2. DEFINITION OF TERMS\nMANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n45\n2.2 Myocardial Infarction\n2.2.1 Definition of Myocardial Injury and Myocardial Infarction\nIt is important to distinguish between myocardial injury and Myocardial Infarction\n(MI). Myocardial injury may be due to:10\n\uf06c Ischemia - MI and/or\n\uf06c Non-ischaemic causes (eg. myocarditis, renal failure)\nMI is myocardial injury due to ischemia and is defined pathologically as myocardial\ncell death due to prolonged ischemia.10\n2.2.1.1 Cardiac Biomarkers in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Injury and\nMyocardial Infarction\nThe cardiac biomarkers of choice for the diagnosis are the cardiac troponins - cTn\n(both I and T), preferably high-sensitivity (hs-cTn). Elevation of cTn indicates\nmyocardial necrosis. A level above the 99th percentile Upper Reference Limit (URL)\nis abnormal and indicative of myocardial injury.10\nAll locally available commercial laboratory-based assays indicate this level, the exact\nvalue varying depending on the reagents and assays used. The point of care (POC)\nkits, however, although giving a more rapid result, are not sensitive enough to detect\nthis low level. With the current definition, UA patients in Braunwald\u2019s Classification Stage III b, will be\nre-classified as NSTEMI.", "chunk_order": 27}

In one study, this re-classification increased the diagnosis\nof MI by 47%.11 This re-classification is of prognostic importance because these\npatients will now be treated more aggressively with GDT.12\ncTn should always be interpreted in the clinical setting. Many cTn elevations,\nespecially below certain cut-off points and cTn elevations without a rise and fall, are\nmyocardial injuries and not MI (Table 2, page 38 & Appendix II, page 94). A rise and/or fall in the cTn level is indicative of acute injury, while a persistently\nelevated level is indicative of chronic injury10 (Table 2, page 38). Persistently elevated\ncTn levels such as that present in those with pre-existing CAD, impaired renal\nfunction, and persons older than 75 years appear predictive of a higher long-term\nmortality.13\nAccording to the 4th Universal definition, MI is diagnosed when there is a significant\nrise and/or fall in cTn, with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL, and\naccompanied with at least one of the following:10\n\uf06c Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischemic origin of > 30 minutes. \uf06c ECG changes of ischemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q\nwaves. \uf06c Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion\nabnormality.

The exact value for the rise and fall is not addressed in most guidelines. The criteria\nfor determining a pathological rise between two serial cTn values are assay-dependent.10\nThe National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry Guidelines and an expert consensus\ncommittee have suggested that in patients with possible ACS and baseline (initial\nresult) cTn (or hs-cTn) results:10,14-16\n\uf06c Markedly above > 99th percentile URL, changes in concentrations of >20% from\nbaseline should be used to define an MI. \uf06c < 99th percentile URL and especially with hs-cTn assays, a change of 50-60% from\nbaseline has been suggested to overcome biological and analytical variations.

UA and NSTEMI differ from each other:\n\uf06c In NSTEMI, the ischemia is severe enough to cause sufficient myocardial injury\nto release detectable cardiac biomarkers. The diagnosis of NSTEMI is established\nif a cardiac biomarker is detected. Often, there is a lapse of time from myocardial\ninjury before these biomarkers can be detected. As such, in the early stages, UA\nand NSTEMI often cannot be differentiated. \uf06c In NSTEMI, ST/T changes may be present in the ECG, whereas in UA they are\nusually absent and even if they are present, are usually transient.

Management\nComparatively fewer studies have been conducted in older adults - specifically\nolder persons are under-represented in many studies on CAD. Therefore, the\nstrength of recommendations for this age group is somewhat lower than that\nsupporting recommendations in younger adults, highlighting the dire need to\nconduct more research studies in this patient population. There is limited trial data to guide management in the older person especially\nin the setting of advanced age (more than 75 years) or significant comorbidity\n(e.g. prior stroke, renal impairment). One should consider the biological age\nrather than the chronological age of the patient when making management\ndecisions. This is almost always based on physician judgement rather than\non biological age predictors. There are several existing predictors which are\nstill in the research stage - the most plausible candidates being the epigenetic\nclock and telomere length.291\nOlder patients are a heterogenous group and the risk benefit ratio of each\nintervention should be individualised. As renal impairment is very common in\nolder adults, creatinine clearance should be calculated to enable appropriate\ndrug dosing (Appendix XIV, page 105).

Exercise training programs should include warm-up, resistance training,\nendurance training, and cool-down. Examples:\n\uf06c Warm-up: stretching, warm-up exercise, low-intensity (slow) walking. \uf06c Main exercises: aerobic exercise and resistance training at prescribed\nintensity. \uf06c Cool-down: low-intensity (slow) walking, stretching, cooling-down exercise. 10.2 Return to Physical Activity\nPhysical activity can be resumed at 50% of maximal exercise capacity in a\npatient with preserved LV function without inducible ischemia within 1 week\npost-discharge.

However, in more recent practice, the CKD-EPI equation tends to be\nused for drug dosing based on eGFR, especially for newer generation drugs. However, drug dosing adjustment should be done according to the United States\nFood and Drug Administrative - or European Medicines Agency-approved product\nlabelling.

It is the main cause of death worldwide whereby 6 million people die every\nyear as a consequence of this habit (WHO Tobacco Fact Sheet, 2016). Smoking has been classified as a chronic disease under Tobacco/Nicotine Dependence in International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnostic code since 2015\nand Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV Criteria). In Malaysia, smoking kills around 20,000 people a year (Tobacco Atlas, 2015) while\nthe cost of treating three out of six chronic diseases related to tobacco was estimated around MYR 2.92 billion (Global Adults Tobacco Survey, 2011).", "chunk_order": 75}

In Malaysia, smoking kills around 20,000 people a year (Tobacco Atlas, 2015) while\nthe cost of treating three out of six chronic diseases related to tobacco was estimated around MYR 2.92 billion (Global Adults Tobacco Survey, 2011). The National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2019 estimated that the prevalence\nof current tobacco smoker in Malaysia age 15 years and above was 21.3%, with\napproximately 4.8 million people with males being higher than females (male:\n40.5%, female: 1.2%). There was a small decline from the 2015 NHMS where the\nprevalence of active tobacco smoker was 22.8%, male was 43% and female was\n1.4%. The Tobacco and E-cigarette Survey Among Adolescents (TECMA) 2016 has stated\nthe prevalence of smoker among adolescent age between 13 to 15 years was 14.8%\nas compared to 13.2% which was reported in the National Health and Morbidity\nSurvey (NHMS): Adolescent Health 2017. The prevalence of smoker among boys\ndropped from 26.1% in 2016 (TECMA) to 20.6% in 2017 (NHMS). However, the\nprevalence of smoker among girls increased from 2.4% in 2016 (TECMA) to 5.7% in\n2017 (NHMS). Hence, the decision for treatment of smoking to be integrated with other chronic non\ncommunicable diseases was made during the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) Steering Committee Meeting in\nDecember 2019 chaired by the honorable Health Minister of Malaysia. The treatment for smoking is based on Clinical Practice Guideline: Treatment for\nTobacco Use Disorder 2016-(Tables A-D)\nMANAGEMENT OF\nNON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n(NSTE-ACS)\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\n3RD EDITION\n2021\n107\nTable A: Assessment And Treatment Tobacco Use Disorder\nASSESSMENT & TREATMENT\nAsk and document smoking status for all patients. Provide brief advice on quit smoking at every visit to all smokers. Assess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Cigarette\nDependence Questionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using\ncarbon monoxide (CO) breath analyser (IF AVAILABLE). Offer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless\ncontraindicated. If selected, use NRT for at least eight to twelve weeks, whereas varenicline\nshould be used for at least twelve weeks. Combination therapy (e.g., two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g. bupropion with a NRT) is\nbetter than monotherapy in smoking cessation treatment and may be most useful\nfor those smokers at highest risk of relapse. Use smoking cessation medications with caution in special populations (e.g.,\nchildren and adolescents, pregnant, breastfeeding women, psychiatric and\nsubstance abuse disorder patients). Arrange a minimum of six to eight face to face follow-up sessions for smoking\ncessation interventions in six months through counselling support team (Health\neducation officer, pharmacists or any officer trained for quit smoking services).", "chunk_order": 76}
