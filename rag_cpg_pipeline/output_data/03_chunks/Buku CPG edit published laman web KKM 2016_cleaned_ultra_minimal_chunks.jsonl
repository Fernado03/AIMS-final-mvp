Every healthcare provider is responsible for the management of\n\u2018their patient based on the clinical presentation and management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were first issued in December 2015 and will be reviewed in\n2019 or earlier if new evidence becomes available.

They may\narise from rests of dental lamina, epithelial rest cell of Malassez or enamel\nforming organ. If these cell rests are situated outside the bone in the soft\ntissues of gingival and edentulous alveolar mucosa, they may give rise to\nperipheral ameloblastoma.

Enucleation\nEnucleation refers to surgically shelling the lesion out of the bone. The aim is\nto remove the whole cyst/tumour without leaving any visible remnants\nbehind. If remnants were expected to have been left behind, enucleation\ncan be coupled with adjunctive procedures like peripheral ostectomy,\napplication of Carnoy\u2019s solution or liquid nitrogen cryotherapy.

This method has a lower recurrence rate (16%) compared to\nenucleation alone or marsupialization for unicystic ameloblastoma.4?- 23!!! 8.3. Dredging\nDredging is a conservative surgical procedure in which following\nenucleation, repeated dredging/curettage is applied to accelerate new\nbone formation by removing the scar tissue from the bony cavity. Dredging\nis carried out at 2-3 month intervals until tumour cells are not seen in scar\ntissue removed by 2 consecutive dredging. Evidence base for this procedure\nis small but recurrence rates are comparable to enucleation coupled with\nadjunctive procedures, #1 !ev!l! t of Ameloblastoma 2015\nManagem:\nDredging or curettage is a procedure where enucleation of the lesion is\nfollowed by repeated curettage of scar tissue from the bony margins to\neradicate any residual tumour cells and promote new bone formation. Dredging is applied at 2-3 month intervals and stopped when tumour cells are\not present in microscopic examination of the scar tissue removed by two\nconsecutive dredging. In very large cysts/tumours, marsupialisation maybe carried out first to\nreduce the size of the lesion, before enucleation or dredging is undertaken. Marsupialisation (decompression) refers to surgically removing the superficial\nbony wall of the lesion, and suturing the incised edge of the cyst/tumour to\nthe adjacent mucosa.
