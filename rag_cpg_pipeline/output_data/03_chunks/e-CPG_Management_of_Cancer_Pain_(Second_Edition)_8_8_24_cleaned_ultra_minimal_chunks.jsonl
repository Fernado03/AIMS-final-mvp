FORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION\n\u2022 In line with the new development in CPG methodology, the\nCPG Unit of MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations,\nAssessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) in its\nwork process. The quality of body of evidence and related effect\nsize are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development\nGroup (DG). \u2022 Recommendations are formulated based on certainty of\nevidence and the wording used denotes the strength of\nrecommendations. This takes into account:\n\uf0a1 quality and level of the evidence\n\uf0a1 balance of benefits and harms of the options\n\uf0a1 patient\u2019s preference and values\n\uf0a1 resource implications\n\uf0a1 relevancy and applicability to the local target population\n\u2022 The more criteria being fulfilled, the more certain is the evidence\nleading to strong recommendations using the word \u201cshould\u201d\nbeing considered. Otherwise, weak recommendations use the\nword \u201cmay\u201d in proposing an action to be made. \u2022 In the CPG, a yellow box highlights important message(s) in\nthe management while a blue box contains evidence-based\nrecommendation(s) for the particular condition. Management of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\nii\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe\nCPG\nDevelopment\nGroup\nhighlighted\nthe\nfollowing\nrecommendations as the key clinical recommendations that should be\nprioritised for implementation. Cancer Pain in Adults\n\u2022 Diagnosis and Assessment\n\u2022 Accurate and comprehensive assessment should be performed prior\nto treatment in all patients with cancer pain. \u2022 Appropriate pain assessment tools should be used regularly on\npatients with cancer pain and documented accordingly. \uf0a1 The preferred unidimensional tools are the Visual Analogue Scale,\nNumerical Rating Scale, Verbal Rating Scale and Faces Pain\nScale. \u2022 Pharmacological Intervention\n\u2022 The treatment of cancer pain should be based on the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) analgesic ladder. \u2022 Paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used for\nmild cancer pain (Step 1 of the World Health Organization analgesic\nladder).", "chunk_order": 2}

Management of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\niii\n\u2022 Opioids (morphine or oxycodone) for breakthrough cancer pain\nshould be prescribed at 1/6 to 1/12 of the 24-hour dose. \u2022 In the management of cancer pain for older patients or those with\nrenal/liver impairment:\n\uf0a1 All opioids should be used with caution. \uf0a1 Adjustment in doses/frequency of opioids should be considered. \u2022 Opioid-induced side effects should be proactively identified and\ntreated adequately to ensure optimum cancer pain management. \u2022 Anticonvulsants or antidepressants may be considered in patients\nwith neuropathic cancer pain. \u2022 Corticosteroids may be used cautiously as an adjuvant in patients\nwith specific cancer pain syndromes. \u2022 Bone targeting agents may be used in cancer patients with painful\nbone metastasis. \u2022 Radiotherapy may be offered to control pain in symptomatic bone\nmetastasis. \uf0a1 Single-fraction external beam therapy is the preferred choice. \u2022 Psychoeducation, psychological and spiritual interventions should\nbe considered in the management of cancer pain. \u2022 Patients whose pain control is poor despite optimal pharmacological\ntherapy should be referred to specialists trained in interventional pain\nmanagement for consideration of the following interventions:\no coeliac plexus neurolysis for advanced pancreatic cancer pain\no superior hypogastric plexus or ganglion impar neurolysis for\nadvanced pelvic and perineal cancer pain\no intrathecal drug delivery system\no vertebroplasty for malignant spinal compression fractures\nCancer Pain in Children\n\u2022 Paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used\nin children with mild cancer pain. \u2022 Paracetamol should be used in combination with opioids as coanalgesic unless contraindicated in children with cancer pain. \u2022 Oral morphine is the preferred choice for children with moderate to\nsevere cancer pain.", "chunk_order": 3}

Management of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\niv\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the DG for this CPG were from the Ministry of\nHealth (MoH) and the Ministry of Higher Education. There was active\ninvolvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee during the process\nof the CPG development. A systematic literature search was conducted using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: Medline via Ovid and Embase. Refer\nto Appendix 1 for an Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion\ncriteria are cancer patients with pain regardless of study design. The\nfirst search was limited to literature published in the last 13 years (2010\nuntil 2023) for most clinical questions on humans and in English. In\naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines\nwere searched and experts in the field were contacted to identify\nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 21 February 2022\nto 21 October 2022. The literature search was repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 30 June 2023 to be included. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from\nthe CPG Secretariat.

All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and the review committee (RC). Where evidence was insufficient,\nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was mainly\nbased on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices considered. The literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the recommendation grading was done using GRADE principles\n(refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows strictly\nthe requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE II). On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It\nwas also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from\nany interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology Assessment\n(HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) reported that there were 48,639 new\ncancer cases in Malaysia in 2020.1 Cancer accounted for over 10% of\nall medically-certified deaths in the country in 2021.2 For those living\nwith cancer, pain is a common and distressing symptom that affects\ntheir quality of life. Pain is defined as \u201can unpleasant sensory and emotional experience\nassociated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential\ntissue damage\u201d.3 Cancer pain or cancer-related pain is pain experienced\nby patients with cancer due to cancer itself or its treatment. A large\nmeta-analysis showed prevalence rates of cancer pain at 39.3% after\ncurative treatment, 55.0% during anticancer treatment and 66.4%\nin advanced, metastatic or terminal disease. Moderate to severe\npain (numerical rating scale score \u22655) was reported by 38.0% of all\npatients.4, level III This indicates that cancer pain is still prevalent despite\ntreatment and about a third of the patients suffer from more than just\nmild pain. There is no local data on the prevalence of cancer pain.", "chunk_order": 8}

There is no local data on the prevalence of cancer pain. However, a local study found that recognition of cancer symptoms\nwhich included pain was relatively low across Malaysia.5, level III\nThe consumption of strong opioid analgesics (morphine, oxycodone,\nfentanyl etc.), which are essential for managing moderate to severe\ncancer pain, is relatively low in Malaysia compared with other countries. A recent local study found that the total strong opioid consumption\n(excluding methadone) in Malaysia was 0.086 defined daily doses\n(DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day in 2005, which increased to 0.126\nDDD in 2014. However, this was lower than the global average of 32.8\nDDD/1000 inhabitants/day.6, level III\nThe main barriers to effective pain control in Malaysia relate to\nphysicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 attitudes towards the use of opioids. In one\nsurvey among physicians, 46% felt they lacked the knowledge to\nmanage patients with severe pain, 40% were concerned about opioid\naddiction and 38% were worried about legal issues. In a survey of\npatients, 62% reported that they did not want to take opioids because\nthey believed that opioids were only for terminal cases, 54% feared\nadverse effects (AEs) e.g. constipation and nausea and 48% feared\nbecoming addicted.7, level III These misconceptions and fears may\nprevent patients from reporting their pain or requesting opioids, and\nphysicians from prescribing adequate doses or using appropriate\nroutes of administration. The first edition of CPG in cancer pain management in Malaysia\nhas helped to spearhead the improvement in this field. Since then,\nservices that provide cancer pain management increased in hospital,\nManagement of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\nprimary care and community hospice levels.

Regular reassessment is vital to\nensure that treatment is effective and safe.11\nCancer pain assessment is further enhanced by the concept of Total\nPain (refer to Figure 1) which guides healthcare providers to view\nthe multidimensionality of pain. A holistic review of the physical,\npsychological, social and spiritual aspects would provide a better\nunderstanding of the individual\u2019s experience of pain.8, level I\nFigure 1.

DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT\nPain is a highly complex and subjective phenomenon. Its components\nare not only physiological, but also include behavioural, cognitive,\nemotional, spiritual and social aspects. Effective treatment of pain\nbegins with a comprehensive assessment encompassing these\nmultidimensional components. The interpretation of pain and how the\nsufferer responds to it behaviourally and emotionally is unique and\nindividualised.9\nAssessment of pain is a vital step in cancer pain management\nand is the responsibility of all healthcare providers. Accurate and\ncomprehensive assessment should be performed prior to treatment\nto plan for appropriate interventions and to assess their effectiveness\nafter initiation.9\n\u2022 Pain assessment aims to determine the:\n\uf0a1 nature and pathophysiology of pain\n\uf0a1 severity of pain\n\uf0a1 impact of pain on functions and quality of life\n\uf0a1 response to interventions\nLike other clinical assessments, a complete pain assessment requires\na detailed history, physical examination and relevant investigations. 3.1 Clinical Presentation\nCancer pain can be classi\ufb01ed by various methods according to\naetiology, pathophysiology, anatomical location of pain syndrome,\ntemporal pattern and severity. In the clinical context, cancer pain is\noften described using a combination of these classi\ufb01cations. Clinical\ncharacteristics of the pathophysiological classes of cancer pain are\nshown in the following Table 1. Table 1.

These may\ninclude radiological investigations such as plain X-rays, bone scans,\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI), and blood investigations e.g., liver and renal function tests. Investigations should be ordered only if the results could potentially\nin\ufb02uence clinical management. 3.3\nPain Assessment Tools\nEffective pain management requires careful assessment and\ndocumentation of the pain. Pain assessment tools incorporate\nunidimensional and multidimensional measures. The most commonly\nused unidimensional assessment tools which are validated and\nadequately reliable are:\n\u2022 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)\n\u2022 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)\n\u2022 Verbal Rating Scale (VRS)\n\u2022 Faces Pain Scale (FPS)\nIt is crucial to determine suitable assessment tools for each patient\naccording to his/her ability to use the tools. The scores should be\ncarefully interpreted by healthcare providers. Pain assessment using\na unidimensional scale is easily executed (with minimal training) and\nsustainable in outpatient settings. In the implementation of \u201cPain as the\n5th Vital Sign\u201d, MoH has advocated the pain assessment tools as listed\nin Appendix 4a (MoH Pain Scale) & 4c (VRS).14\nA correlational study on various unidimensional tools [(NRS-11), Faces\nPain Scale (FPS), Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS) and a mixed scale\n(consisting of NRS-11, FPS and VDS)] in cancer patients aged \u226565\nyears showed:15, level III\n\u2022 all four scales were reliable and valid for assessing cancer pain\n\u2022 NRS-11 had the highest test-retest reliability for current pain\n\u2022 VDS had the highest reliability for least pain\n\u2022 FPS had the highest reliability for average pain\n\u2022 mixed scale had the highest reliability for worst pain\nA large systematic review measured assessment tools (unidimensional\nand multidimensional) for cancer pain in adults based on psychometric\nproperties and clinical utility.", "chunk_order": 13}

However, there was\nno mention on the quality of the primary papers used in the review. Recommendation 1\n\u2022 Accurate and comprehensive assessment should be performed prior\nto treatment in all patients with cancer pain. \u2022 Appropriate pain assessment tools* should be used regularly on\npatients with cancer pain and documented accordingly. \uf0a1 The preferred unidimensional tools are Visual Analogue Scale,\nNumerical Rating Scale, Verbal Rating Scale and Faces Pain Scale. *Refer to Appendix 4 for Assessment Tools\n3.3.1 Assessment tools for neuropathic pain\nNeuropathic pain is defined by the International Association for the\nStudy of Pain (IASP) as \u201cpain caused by a lesion or disease of the\nsomatosensory nervous system\u201d.3 It is a frequent consequence of\ncancer pain and poses considerable suffering to the patients and their\nfamilies. Neuropathic pain is a notable clinical challenge in relation to diagnosis\nand thus can be overlooked in cancer pain. A cross-sectional study\nlooked into the predictors and common symptoms of neuropathic\ncancer pain and showed:17, level III\n\u2022 predictors were age <65 years old, disease duration >6 months,\nstage IV cancer, history of chemotherapy and moderate-to-severe\ncancer pain\n\u2022 common descriptive symptoms were tingling, electric shock, and\n\u2018pins and needles\u2019\nIt is important to identify neuropathic pain using appropriate tools. Two diagnostic studies looked into the accuracy of such tools. The\nfirst study on The Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and\nSigns (LANSS) scale compared pain of predominantly neuropathic\nor nociceptive origin in patients with refractory cancer-related pain. Based on the reference test of clinician assessment, the AUC was 0.96\nand a specificity of 100% at a cut-off value of 12 points in detecting\nneuropathic pain.18, level I\nIn another diagnostic study on neuropathic pain in oncology patients\nusing pain specialist\u2019s diagnosis as the gold standard, the findings\nwere:19, level III\n\u2022 AUC of PainDETECT and Doeleur Neuropathique en 4 (DN4)\nwere 0.870 (95% CI 0.813 to 0.926) and 0.857 (95% CI 0.799 to\n0.914) respectively\nManagement of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\n\u2022 PainDETECT had a specificity of 100% at cut-off value of \u226519,\nwhile DN4 had 88.7% with a cut-off value of \u22654\n\u2022 The following tools have shown good diagnostic properties in\ndetecting neuropathic pain:\n\uf0a1 LANSS\n\uf0a1 PainDETECT\n\uf0a1 DN4\n\u2022 The diagnosis of neuropathic pain needs to be confirmed with clinical\nassessment. 3.3.2 Comprehensive Assessment\nA comprehensive assessment is essential to achieve successful\ncancer pain management. It includes the elements of history taking,\nphysical examination, psychological and spiritual assessment. The\nuse of assessment tools during clinical encounters has the potential to\nshape the individual patient\u2019s care in terms of experience, compliance,\nsatisfaction and improve rapport with healthcare providers.

There\nare a number of available tools for comprehensive assessment e.g. Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS), Edmonton Symptom\nAssessment System (ESAS) and Memorial Symptom Assessment\nScale (MSAS).11\nThe IPOS is valid (good internal consistency with Cronbach \u03b1\u2009 of 0.77)\nand reliable (good test-retest reliability with 60% of items having \u03baw\n>0.60) for outcome measures, both in patient self-report and staff\nproxy-report versions.20, level III\nESAS has many modified versions. A correlational study on ESAS\nusing NRS with additional symptoms of constipation, sleep and added\ntime window of \u201cpast 24 hours\u201d (ESAS-CS) and a version where a time\nwindow of \u201cnow\u201d was added (ESAS-r-CS) were compared with MSAS.

There are the\nsingle-item Distress Thermometer (DT) (refer to Appendix 4h & 4i)\nand the multiple-item tools such as Hospital Anxiety and Depression\nScale (HADS), Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18),9 Patient Health\nQuestionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) that\nare used to screen for psychological distress. The foundation for spiritual evaluation models is a collection of\ninterpretive frameworks that requires substantial training in its use.

Management of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\n4. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION\nThe cornerstone of cancer pain management is using pharmacological\nagents to provide pain relief and improve the quality of life for the patients. The analgesics used can be divided into three main classes, namely\nopioids, non-opioids and adjuvant medications. The choice of analgesic\nas well as the dose and route of administration would depend on the\ntype and severity of pain. Other factors to be considered include age,\nco-morbidities and patient\u2019s adherence. A combination of medications\nmay be used. It is essential to monitor the patient\u2019s response to the\nmedication while minimising any AEs in achieving optimal pain control. 4.1 Principles of Analgesic Medicine\nWHO recommends the use of analgesic medicine should follow these\nprinciples:11\n\u2022 By mouth\n\uf0a1 Analgesic medication should be given by mouth whenever possible. \u2022 By the clock\n\uf0a1 Doses of analgesic medication should be given at fixed intervals\naround-the-clock. \uf0a1 The aim is for the next dose to be given before the previous dose effect\nhas worn off. \u2022 For the individual\n\uf0a1 As each patient is unique and different, analgesic therapy should be\nindividualised. \uf0a1 This is based on the type of pain, response to medication, AE etc. \u2022 Attention to detail\n\uf0a1 Prescription timing should consider the patient\u2019s day and sleep\nschedule. \uf0a1 Education on the use of these medications should be given including\neffects and AEs.", "chunk_order": 16}

In the previous edition of CPG on cancer pain, it is stated that oral\nmorphine should be the first choice of treatment in moderate to severe\ncancer pain. Alternatives to it are oxycodone and fentanyl.9\nWHO recommends oral morphine, i.e. regular dosing of IR or SR\nformulation, should be used to maintain effective and safe pain relief\nin cancer pain. IR morphine should be used as rescue medicine with\neither formulation. Thus, IR morphine must be available and accessible\nto those who require it. Apart from that, SR morphine should be made\navailable as an addition to IR morphine.11\nThe time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of IR and SR oral\nmorphine is 1 hour and 2 - 6 hours respectively. The Tmax for intravenous\n(IV) and subcutaneous (SC) morphine is 5 - 10 minutes and 15 minutes\nrespectively.

This allows the onset of analgesia using CR\nManagement of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\noxycodone within one hour of ingestion and an analgesic duration of 12\nhours.36, level III\n\u2022\nFentanyl\nFentanyl is an alternative opioid that can be used in cancer pain. In\nMalaysia, it is available as transdermal patch, sublingual and parenteral\npreparations. Transdermal (TD) fentanyl should only be considered in patients with\nstable opioid requirements who have difficulty swallowing or intractable\nnausea and vomiting.9 In a Cochrane systematic review comparing\nTD fentanyl with oral morphine for relief of cancer pain, there was\ninsufficient comparable data for a meta-analysis to be undertaken\nfor the analgesic effect. However, transdermal fentanyl showed a\nreduction in constipation (RR=0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78; NNT=5.5). No\nmeaningful analysis was possible for other AEs.37, level I\nWhen switching from other opioids to transdermal fentanyl, there is a\nlag time between application of the patch and onset of analgesia due to\nits pharmacokinetics whereby on average, minimally effective plasma\nconcentrations of fentanyl are seen in 12 hours. Regular 4-hourly\noral opioids should therefore, be discontinued 12 hours after patch\napplication. Similarly, when converting from SR opioid preparations, the\npatch should be applied together with the last dose of SR medication.9\nHowever, an RCT on the conversion of IV to transdermal fentanyl in\nchronic cancer pain revealed that the effectiveness of continuing the IV\nfor six hours after patch application (6-h method) was equivalent to the\n12-h method in terms of number of rescue doses for breakthrough pain\nrequired (p>0.05) and thus may be considered for a simpler method of\nconversion.38, level I\nThe Tmax of transdermal fentanyl is 12 - 24 hours and the duration of\naction is 72 hours.

For\npersistent pain, an IR formulation should be given every four hours\nto control background pain and with similar doses given up to every\nhour as needed for breakthrough pain. Patients who have been taking\nother analgesics, such as NSAIDs, may continue these analgesics after\nopioid initiation if these agents provide additional analgesia and are not\ncontraindicated. Oral morphine is the first-line therapy for moderate to severe cancer pain. A dose of 5 mg 4-hourly of IR oral morphine in opioid-naive patients has\nbeen shown to be a safe and effective starting dose (p<0.01). Opioidnaive patients are those not chronically receiving opioid analgesic on\na daily basis and therefore have not developed significant tolerance. Patients already on regular weak opioids (tramadol or dihydrocodeine)\nmay have morphine initiated at a dose equivalent to that of the weak\nopioid (refer to Table 4). A lower starting dose of 2.5 mg 4 - 6 hourly of\nIR oral morphine has been shown to be effective (p<0.01) and safe in\nelderly or frail patients.

There is no maximum dose for opioids in cancer pain management.

Management of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\n4.4.5. Opioid rotation\nOpioid rotation is a strategy of switching from one opioid to another to\nimprove pain relief or reduce AEs. This strategy may be indicated in up to 44% of patients with cancerrelated pain. Improvement in pain as well as reduced AEs after rotation\nwere seen in 50 - 90% of these patients. Uncontrolled pain was the\nmain reason for opioid rotation in the outpatient setting while AEs were\nthe reason in the inpatient setting where patients were often more\ndebilitated.47, level III\n\u2022 Common indications for opioid switching include:47, level III\n\uf0a1 inadequate pain relief despite appropriate titration\n\uf0a1 intolerable AEs (e.g. sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation)\n\uf0a1 organ impairment\n\uf0a1 practical considerations (e.g. lack of compliance, inability to swallow)\nIn a large systematic review on opioid rotation, the findings were:48, level I\n\u2022 all studies showed pain improvement or stable pain relief with\nopioid rotation\n\u2022 dose titration may still be necessary to achieve stable analgesia\n\u2022 no particular opioid demonstrated superiority to another opioid\n\u2022 a higher dosage of the first-line opioid tended to result in lower\nsuccess rates of rotation\n\u2022 reduction of AEs was limited with rotation, but patient\u2019s satisfaction\nwas generally positive ranging from 60 - 90%\nRotating between opioids remains challenging due to a lack of wellestablished evidence to support the dose conversions used in clinical\npractice, and more so in complex cases when there is a need to balance\nbetween pain relief and AEs. To address this, a common suggestion is\nto reduce the calculated dose by 25 - 50% when initiating opioid rotation\nand titrate upwards accordingly.9 Because of individual variability, the\nconversion between opioids should always take into consideration\nthe patient\u2019s co-morbidities, concomitant medications, pain and AE\nintensity and also any pharmacokinetic factors that could influence the\neffectiveness of the medications.", "chunk_order": 27}

It is a very rare event\nthat may occur during rapid titration.9 It is uncommon during chronic\nadministration.40 When appropriately titrated against the patient\u2019s pain,\nstrong opioids do not cause clinically important respiratory depression.34\nSedation almost always precedes respiratory depression. Therefore,\nsedation assessment is a good early clinical indicator of opioid-induced\nrespiratory depression.9\nIf severe respiratory depression occurs (respiratory rate <8/minute),\nvery low doses of naloxone at 40 mcg (0.04 mg) can be used and\ntitrated every 1 - 3 minutes against the patient\u2019s respiratory rate. Large bolus doses of naloxone should not be given as it reverses the\nanalgesic effects and causes major physical withdrawal syndromes.

Recommendation 12\n\u2022 Opioid-induced side effects should be proactively identified and\ntreated adequately to ensure optimum cancer pain management. \u2022 Laxatives should be prophylactically prescribed in patients with\ncancer pain and on regular opioid therapy. 4.4.10\nTolerance and addiction to opioids\n\u2022\nTolerance to opioids\nOpioid tolerance is defined as a long-term body adaptation to opioids\nresulting in reduced clinical effectiveness of opioids with repeated use\nat the same dose.57\nOpioid tolerance in cancer is known to be contributed by the\ndownregulation of mu-receptors in neuronal cells. The exact mechanism\nis still not well understood. Persistent pain, chronic opioid administration\nand reduced expression of opioid receptors on certain types of cancer\ncells are possible causes of mu-receptor downregulation.58\nFear of opioid tolerance should not cause any hesitation to start or\nincrease opioid therapy for cancer patients experiencing pain. However,\nwhen opioid doses are very high (oral morphine >600 mg/day, oral\noxycodone >400 mg/day or transdermal fentanyl >200 mcg/hour),\npatients should be referred to a pain specialist or palliative medicine\nspecialist.9\n\u2022\nAddiction/misuse of opioids\nThe incidence of opioid misuse in advanced cancer patients differs\nwidely between studies in a recent systematic review. Particularly\namong children, adolescents and young adults, misuse behaviours\nwere reported to range from 7% to 90%.59, level I Nonspecific substance\nuse disorders were reported to range between 2% to 35% of adults with\ncancer.

The NCCN guidelines suggest the use of Screener and\nOpioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R) and\nthe Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) for patients considered for long-term opioid\ntherapy in predicting opioid misuse. For patients already on opioids, the\nguidelines suggest the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) tool to\ndetect aberrant behaviour associated with opioid misuse.61\n\u2022 It is important to identify patients at risk of opioid misuse so that they\ncan be closely monitored. \u2022 Fear of opioid misuse or tolerance should not preclude the start of\nopioid therapy for cancer patients experiencing pain. 4.5 Adjuvants\nAdjuvant analgesics are medications with primary indications other than\npain.

However, they are useful in managing certain painful conditions,\nparticularly neuropathic pain. The most common classes of adjuvant\nanalgesics used in cancer pain management are anticonvulsants,\nantidepressants and corticosteroids.

Combination\ntherapy of gabapentin with morphine was superior to monotherapy. Studies using other antiepileptic agents were mostly negative. The\nrecommendation on the anticonvulsants based on GRADE was strong. In a Cochrane systematic review, a small RCT on cancer-related\nneuropathic pain showed that gabapentin 1800 mg daily and pregabalin\n600 mg decreased pain scores, had a morphine-sparing effect and\nimproved functional capacity. The quality of the evidence was very\nlow.63, level I\nManagement of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\nHowever, a meta-analysis on patients with tumour-related cancer pain\ndemonstrated that adding gabapentin or pregabalin to stable opioid\nanalgesia did not improve pain intensity.

PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTION\nPyschoeducation, psychological and spiritual interventions are\nimportant in the management of cancer pain. Patients with cancer pain\nmay perceive the pain as the most feared physical consequence. The\nconsequences may be related to losing hope for cure or as a punishment\nfor previous wrongdoings. It can also affect mood and cause anxiety\nand other psychological symptoms.9\n5.1 Psychoeducation Intervention\nA systematic review of four RCTs reported that educational interventions\ngiven by healthcare providers (e.g. provision of educational information,\nbehavioural instructions and advice) showed mixed results in the\nimprovement of pain intensity and interference.

Tumour-related pain can present:112\n\u2022 before or at diagnosis\n\u2022 during initial treatment\n\u2022 when tumour is resistant to treatment\n\u2022 at disease recurrence\nThe following table shows examples of cancer-related pain in children.

The\nfollowing are principles to guide pain assessment in children using the\nacronym A.B.C.D.E:\nTable 7. ABC of Pain Assessment in Children112\nAssessment and management of pain in children and infants are\ndifferent from adults due to:112\n\u2022 Communication: Children have limited verbal and cognitive abilities. Non-verbal cues and observation are essential approaches to\nassessment. \u2022 Development: Children have a wide physiological, cognitive, and\ndevelopmental response to pain according to their age groups. This has to be carefully assessed. \u2022 Fear and anxiety: Children are reluctant to report pain that reflect\ntheir pain experience. Managing emotions can be done through\nplay therapy, distraction and other cognitive behaviour strategies. \u2022 Dosage: Medication must be carefully adjusted according to age,\nweight and developmental understanding. Adolescent also has a\nunique approach to cancer pain management. Healthcare workers\nwill require appropriate training for assessment and management. \u2022 Parental involvement: Caregivers input is an essential component\nand part of the assessment. \u2022 Ethical consideration: Children are not able to give consent for any\nintervention and medical management. Consent must be taken\nfrom legal caregivers or parents. 8.2 Pain Assessment Tools\nThe choice of a pain assessment tool should take into consideration:112, 113\n\u2022 the child\u2019s developmental age\n\u2022 verbal ability\nThese are shown in Table 8 and 9.

In developing countries, children with cancer experience pain related\nto advanced disease and treatment approaches e.g. chemotherapy or\nradiotherapy.114\n\u2022\nNon-opioid analgesics\nThe first step in the WHO Analgesic 3-Step Ladder is non-opioid drugs,\ne.g. paracetamol and NSAIDs, with the optional use of adjuvants\nfor mild pain.112 In the second step of WHO pain ladder, non-opioid\nanalgesics may work synergistically with opioids as co-analgesic to\nproduce a better pain relief (refer to Figure 3).112\nParacetamol is generally safe but may cause hepatotoxicity if\noverdosed (refer to Appendix 5b).115 GI ulceration, nephrotoxicity\nand CV events are the known AEs of NSAIDs. Thus, lowest effective\ndose of NSAIDs should be given with proton pump inhibitors to prevent\ngastro-duodenal ulcers.116 The dosages of commonly use non-opioid\nanalgesics are shown in Appendix 5b. Recommendation 17\n\u2022 Paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used\nin children with mild cancer pain. \u2022 Paracetamol should be used in combination with opioids as coanalgesic unless contraindicated in children with cancer pain. To refer to Pain Service for:\nManagement of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\n\u2022\nOpioid analgesics\nMorphine is considered in the second step of WHO 3-Step Ladder\nwhen the pain is moderate to severe in children.

Caution on the\nuse codeine and tramadol has been issued due to ultra metabolisers\nand potential AEs.117, level III\na. Tramadol\nTramadol is a synthetic analgesic with unpredictable effects due to\nits wide variability in metabolism. The drug has a ceiling effect. It is\nunsuitable for escalating mild-moderate pain or severe pain. It has the\npotential to cause side effects in children.112\nb. Morphine\nOral morphine is the first-line therapy for severe cancer pain in children. Its effectiveness in pain relief has been extrapolated from the treatment\nof adult with chronic cancer pain.112 Oral morphine is available as either\nIR or SR preparations. IV morphine is used for rapid onset analgesia\nand when the patients are unable to tolerate oral morphine.117, level III If\nthe opioid requirement goes beyond 1 mg/kg/day, it is likely that the\npatient will require regular morphine.113; 115 Morphine dose should be\nmonitored after 24 - 48 hours of morphine use. Alternative routes of\nadministration should be based on clinical judgement, drug availability\nand patient\u2019s preference. The initial dose of morphine and its frequency\nis shown in Appendix 5b. Case Example for Opioid Titration in Paediatric Cancer Pain\nAiman is a 10-year-old boy with relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nwith bone metastasis. He complains of generalised pain with pain score\nof 6/10. He is opioid na\u00efve with normal renal and liver function. His\nweight is 20kg and he is currently at home. Method of dose calculation:\n\u2022 Immediate release oral morphine 0.2 mg/kg/dose x 20 kg = 4 mg\nq4h (maximum initial dose is 5 mg/dose for children) = 24 mg/day\nBreakthrough dose: 1/10 to 1/6 of daily dose (2.5 - 4 mg), can be served\n1-2 hours after previous dose of morphine. Recommendation 18\n\u2022 Oral morphine is the preferred choice for children with moderate to\nsevere cancer pain. Management of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\nc. Fentanyl\nTransdermal fentanyl is an effective alternative to oral morphine in\nchildren with difficulty in swallowing or those having intractable nausea\nand vomiting whose opioid requirements are stable.115 IV fentanyl can\nbe used in children with specific circumstances e.g. renal failure but\npreferably this is done under specialist care.112 Refer to Table 4 on\nsuggested dose conversion ratio for conversion of oral morphine to\nfentanyl patch. d.

Recommendation 19\n\u2022 Fentanyl or oxycodone may be used as alternative analgesics in\nchildren with moderate to severe cancer pain. e. Methadone\nMethadone is only used as an alternative opioid for cancer pain\nin children. However, it should only be prescribed under specialist\nsupervision in palliative care settings.118, level III\nFor opioid AEs and their management, refer to Chapter 4.4.8. \u2022\nAdjuvant drugs\nAdjuvant analgesics may be used with other analgesics including\nstrong opioids in children with cancer pain.11 Combining drugs with\ndifferent mechanisms of action improve analgesia and decrease AEs\nin the patients. This can be used at any stage of pain severity as per\nFigure 3. However, there is insufficient evidence on the use of adjuvant\nanalgesics in the paediatric age group. The use of antidepressants in children has been associated with\nan increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.119 However,\namitriptyline has been used in the management of pain especially bone\npain and neuropathic pain in children.120, level III\nIn children, neuropathic pain can be treated with anticonvulsants\ne.g. gabapentin, pregabalin and sodium valproate. It is important to\nmonitor undesired AEs e.g. headache, drowsiness and ataxia when\ncommencing these agents.113\nKetamine should be used by specialists familiar with cancer pain\nmanagement in children. It is generally used in low doses.115\nManagement of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\nCorticosteroids are commonly used for children with pain related to mass\neffect of tumour e.g. headache from brain metastases, abdominal pain\nfrom liver capsule distension or intestinal obstruction and neuropathic\npain from spinal cord compression.121\nBisphosphonates should be considered where analgesics and/\nor radiotherapy are inadequate for the management of painful bone\nmetastases.120, level III; 121; 122, level III\nRefer to Appendix 5b on Dosage of Commonly Used Adjuvant Drugs\nin Children with Cancer Pain.

A Cochrane systemic review\non telephone interventions for adults with cancer showed limited\nand mixed results on pain reduction compared with usual care. The\ncertainty of the evidence on this outcome was very low.131, level I In a nonrandomised controlled trial, home telemonitoring significantly increased\npain registration and prescription for analgesics compared with usual\ncare in cancer patients.132, level II-1\nIn another systematic review assessing the effectiveness of mHealth\napplications (apps) for self-management in improving pain, psychological\ndistress, fatigue or sleep outcomes in adult cancer survivors, three out\nof four studies reported improvement in pain but only one showed a\nsignificant difference in those patients using the apps compared with\nthose not using it.133, level I\nManagement of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\nA meta-analysis on the effectiveness of telemedicine on pain\nmanagement in patients with cancer showed it improved:134, level I\n\u2022 pain intensity (SMD= -0.28, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.06)\n\u2022 pain interference (SMD= -0.41, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.28)\nAccording to the Cochrane Risk of Bias, the risk of bias in most studies\nwas considered low.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality\nhealthcare services based on the best and most recent available\nevidence applied to local scenario and expertise. Various factors and\nresource implications should be considered for the success of the\nuptake in the CPG recommendations. 11.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in this CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 availability of the CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies/online)\n\u2022 regular seminars/conferences/courses for healthcare providers on\nmanagement of cancer pain including those involving professional\nbodies\n\u2022 presence of \u201cPain as 5th Vital Sign\u201d strategy and pain-free hospital\nconcept involving multidisciplinary team\n\u2022 public awareness activities that involve governmental/nongovernmental organisations e.g. World Hospice and Palliative\nCare Day\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n\u2022 limited awareness and understanding/knowledge in managing\ncancer pain among healthcare providers especially on the use of\nopioids\n\u2022 variation in clinical management and preferences\n\u2022 insufficient resources in terms of expertise and medications\n\u2022 misconception about the disease and its management by the\npublic\n11.2 Potential Resource Implications\nAppropriate assessment and treatment of cancer pain is crucial for the\nsuccessful management of the condition. This includes the proper use\nof opioids for moderate to severe cancer pain. However, barriers to its\nuse dampen the aims of controlling cancer pain at various level of care. These are supported by local studies on the issue and the lower rate\nof opioid use in the country compared with the global rate. Efforts must\nbe improved to educate both healthcare providers and patients/carers\non the judicious use of opioids in patients with cancer pain. Working\ntogether with the NGOs like hospice will facilitate the implementation of\nthese guidelines. Certain medications like IR morphine should be made\navailable in all primary care centres.

Use only water to wash the skin. Do not apply soap, cream,\noil or ointment on the area. \u2022\nDo NOT apply the patch over your Totally Implantable Venous\nCatheter (e.g. chemoport)/over a joint area/on irradiated skin. \u2022\nBody hair should be clipped with scissors IF necessary and NOT\nshaved. Step 2: Preparation of patch\n\u2022\nEach patch is sealed in its own sachet. Tear or cut open the sachet\nat the notch/arrow. Do NOT cut across the middle of the sachet. Step 3: Method of administration\n\u2022\nPeel one half of the plastic backing away from the centre of the\npatch. Try not to touch the sticky side of the patch. Press the sticky\npart of the patch onto the skin. \u2022\nRemove the other half of the plastic backing and press the whole\npatch onto the skin. Hold for 30 seconds. Make sure it sticks well,\nespecially the edges. \u2022\nChange the patch every 72 hours. Remove the old patch before\napplying a new one. The date and time of patch due change should\nbe written on the patch. \u2022\nDo NOT apply the patch on the same place twice in a row. Change\nthe site of application to allow the skin to rest. \u2022\nIf you need to apply more than one patch at a time, place the\npatches adequately apart so that the edges do not touch or overlap\neach other. \u2022\nIf the patch falls off/peels off before the date and time of due\nchange, apply a new patch on a new area of skin. Step 3: Disposal of used patch\n\u2022\nFold used patch in half with the adhesive side inwards. \u2022\nDiscard in clinical waste bin (in the hospital) or in a waste bin at\nhome and wash your hands.

PHARMACOKINETICS & AVAILABILITY:\n\u2022\nRoute of administration: IV is preferable, but SC or IM can also be\nused\n\u2022\nOnset of action: 1 - 2 minutes (IV) and 2 - 5 minutes (SC/IM)\n\u2022\nHalf-life: approximately 1 hour\n\u2022\nPack size: 1 ampoule = 400 mcg/1 ml\n\u2022\nAdverse effects (usually with large bolus doses): abdominal\ncramps, nausea and vomiting, flushing, arrhythmias and erythema\nat injection site\nTREATMENT:\n\u2022\nRespiratory depression is usually preceded by a progressive\nreduction in consciousness. \u2022\nIf the respiratory rate \u22658 breaths/minute and patient can be easily\naroused (e.g. opens eyes to verbal command), monitor patient\nclosely and consider omitting or reducing the dose of the regular\nopioid. \u2022\nIf respiratory rate is \u22648 breaths/min and patient is unresponsive,\ndiscontinue the ongoing opioid (e.g. stop CSCI/CIVI, remove TD\npatch) and naloxone should be administered. \uf0a1\nDilute 1 ampoule (400 mcg) of naloxone in 10 ml water for\ninjection\n\uf0a1\nAdminister small boluses of 0.5 ml (20 mcg) every two minutes\nuntil respiratory rate is satisfactory, and patient is easily\narousable (need not be fully alert)\n\uf0a1\nAfter the last dose of naloxone, continue to monitor the patient\n\uf0a1\nFurther boluses of naloxone might be necessary because\nnaloxone is shorter acting than the opioids. \uf0a1\nA naloxone infusion may be considered if recovery is not\nsatisfactory with multiple bolus doses. Management of Cancer Pain (Second Edition)\n\u2022\nAfter patient recovers, the regular opioid regimen must be reviewed\nto consider possible causes for the respiratory depression (e.g. drug interactions, drug accumulation due to renal impairment,\nmedication errors) and necessary modifications made to the\nregimen. ADDITIONAL CAUTIONS:\n\u2022\nDo not use large bolus doses e.g. \u201c1 ampoule stat\u201d in patients who\nare receiving opioids for chronic pain relief. \u2022\nPupil size is an unreliable indicator of opioid overdose in patients\ntaking regular opioids\n\u2022\nNaloxone should not be given to patients on opioids when death\nis expected and imminent; a slow respiratory rate is a normal\noccurrence.
