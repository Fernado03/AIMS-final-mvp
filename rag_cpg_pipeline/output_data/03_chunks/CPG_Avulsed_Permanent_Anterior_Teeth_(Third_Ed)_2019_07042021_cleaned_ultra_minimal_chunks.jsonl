They are\nintended as a guide for the best clinical practice in the management of\navulsed permanent anterior teeth presently. However, it must be noted that\nadherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to the best clinical\noutcome in individual patient care, as every health care provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical presentation and management options available locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in December 2019 and will be reviewed in\n2024 or earlier if important new evidence becomes available. When it is due\nfor updating, the head of related specialty will be informed about it. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and discussion will be done on the need\nfor a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. The systematic review\nmethodology used by the Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section\n(MaHTAS) will be employed in review of the guidelines.

The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Avulsed Permanent\nAnterior Teeth in Children (November 2010) was used as the basis for the\ndevelopment of these guidelines. The recommendations were formulated\ntaking into consideration the best available evidence and local practices. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition.

Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic\nstudies, preferably from more than one centre or research group. Evidence obtained from multiple time series studies, with or without\nintervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the\nresults of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s) could also\nbe regarded as this type of evidence.

If immediate replantation is not possible, the avulsed permanent\nanterior tooth should be kept in an appropriate storage medium. Recommendation 2\nReplantation of avulsed permanent anterior tooth should not be carried\nout in patients who suffer severe concomitant injuries or are severely\nmedically compromised. Recommendation 3\nEarly pulp extirpation should be carried out for replanted mature\navulsed permanent anterior tooth to minimise the possibility of\ninflammatory root resorption, which would cause early failure. For better outcome of replanted avulsed permanent anterior tooth with\nguarded prognosis, the pulp should be extirpated early within 7 to 14\ndays. Recommendation 4\nAll cases of replanted avulsed permanent anterior teeth should be\nfollowed up for five years. Recommendation 5\nAutotransplantation may be considered in the management of\nankylosed replanted avulsed permanent anterior teeth when donor\ntooth is available. 2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\n1. INTRODUCTION\nTooth avulsion (Figure 1, 2 and 3) is defined as the complete dislocation of\na tooth from the alveolar bone and soft-tissue socket.1 A sufficient force is\nrequired to disrupt the tooth from its periodontal ligament, as it is embraced\nin the alveolar socket. The prevalence of tooth avulsion among adults aged 18 years and above\nranged from 5% to 15%.2-6 The number of individuals suffering from tooth\navulsion increases with a decrease in age.7 Adults aged between 18 to 30\nyears, have been shown to have the lowest number of tooth avulsion\nreported (15%), as compared to adolescents (17%) and children (68%).5 In\nyoung children, the relatively resilient alveolar bone provides only minimal\nresistance to extrusive forces. The National Oral Health Survey of Schoolchildren in 2017 reported the\nprevalence of traumatised anterior teeth among children aged between 16\nyears and below to be 7.2%8 which was lower than that reported in other\ncountries.9-12 84.5% of the traumatised anterior teeth amongst 12 years old\nremained untreated.8 A local retrospective study from 2001 to 2006 showed\navulsion of permanent teeth occurred between the age of 10 and 13 years,\nwith most cases involving permanent maxillary incisors.

Tooth Maturity\nTooth maturity is an important factor in determining the prognosis of avulsed\npermanent anterior teeth. The absence of inflammatory root resorption is an indicator of periodontal\nhealing. A meta-analysis on replanted avulsed teeth showed higher\nincidence of inflammatory (30%) and replacement (39%) root resorption in\nimmature teeth compared to mature teeth (24% and 33% respectively).25, level\nII-1\nWith regards to pulp healing of immature avulsed permanent anterior tooth,\nshorter pulp length (less than \u00be root form) shows higher chance of\npulp revascularisation than longer pulp length. The pulp\u2019s width or\ndiameter of apical foramen has no effect on the possibility of pulp\nrevascularisation.36, level II-2\nFor mature avulsed tooth where the apex is closed or nearly closed (<1mm),\nthe possibility of pulp revascularisation is very minute.36, level II-2; 37-39, level III\n5.4. Root Canal Treatment\nRoot canal treatment (Figure 4) in replanted avulsed permanent anterior\ntooth is routinely carried out to improve the prognosis. In a meta-analysis on the influence of pulp extirpation of replanted avulsed\npermanent anterior teeth, there was significant difference in the development\nof inflammatory root resorption, within 14 days compared with after 14 days\n(OR=0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.98). This means that delayed pulp extirpation\nwill have higher incidence of inflammatory root resorption. On the contrary,\nthere was no significant difference in terms of periodontal healing and\nreplacement root resorption between both groups. 40, level III\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\nEarly pulp extirpation at day 1 or day 2, especially in mature avulsed tooth,\nshows better periodontal ligament healing and less replacement root\nresorption compared with pulp extirpation done within day 3 - 14.26, level III\nHowever, early intervention of pulp extirpation must be balanced against the\nneed to allow time for initial injury healing, and resolution of associated pain\nand swelling.

Therefore, root canal treatment\ncan be delayed and the replanted tooth should be monitored regularly (refer\nto section 6) in order to determine if revascularisation would occur, or until\nthere are definite signs of pulpal necrosis. Pulp extirpation should be performed early, preferably during extra-alveolar\nperiod prior to replantation of an avulsed permanent anterior tooth that has\nbeen stored dry, or in unsuitable storage medium for more than 60 minutes.

The removal\nof splint depends on the clinical presentations (e.g. reduced mobility to grade\n1 or physiological mobility) during the follow-up review. NaOCl for five minutes was effective at removing the necrotic cells with\nminimal influence on cementum integrity. The usage of 1% NaOCl for 15\nminutes was proven to be less damaging to the cementum.50, level III\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\n5.7. Root Surface Treatment\nThe use of enamel matrix protein derivatives in avulsed permanent teeth has\nno beneficial effect on the prognosis.25, level II-1 Moreover, there is insufficient\nretrievable evidence to show the effectiveness and safety of other root\nsurface treatment on the periodontal regeneration. Therefore, the CPG\ndevelopment group is unable to suggest any forms of root surface treatment\n(e.g. fluoride, enamel matrix protein derivatives, citric acid and antibiotics) in\nthe management of avulsed permanent anterior teeth. 5.8. Systemic Antibiotics\nSystemic antibiotics is commonly prescribed to treat and prevent dental\ninfections. Infections in replanted avulsed permanent anterior teeth may be\ncaused by bacterial contamination of the pulp and the periodontal ligament,\nfrom the environment and exposure to saliva during replantation.

In addition, untreated pulpal necrosis due to\ncontamination of bacteria within the root canal and dentinal tubules,\ncontributes to and aggravates the inflammatory root resorption process. Furthermore, inflammatory root resorption could cause dentine exposure\nthrough which toxins from bacteria present in the tubules and/or the infected\nroot canal can be transmitted to the periodontal ligament.37, level III\nInflammatory root resorption occurs in 23% (range of 0% to 64%) 25, level II-1 of\nreplanted avulsed permanent anterior teeth and can usually be diagnosed at\n8 months (between 5 and 12 months) post-replantation.56, level III Immature\nteeth demonstrated slightly higher prevalence to mature teeth of developing\ninflammatory root resorption, despite having the potential for pulpal\nrevascularisation (6.2%-69.2% for immature teeth and 2.8%-64.3% for\nmature teeth).25, level II-1\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\npulpal necrosis\ninflammatory root resorption\nreplacement root resorption or ankylosis\ntooth loss\n6.2.3.

MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\n7.2. Replacement Root Resorption or Ankylosis\nThere is insufficient high-quality evidence regarding the management of\nreplacement root resorption or ankylosed replanted avulsed permanent\nanterior tooth which poses a great challenge for clinical practice. Its\nmanagement is complex and requires short- and long-term treatment\nplanning with inter-disciplinary involvements. Tooth ankylosis in growing children often leads to failure of eruption resulting\nin infra-occlusion. It disrupts local alveolar growth development and results in\nspace loss, tilting of adjacent teeth and poor aesthetic. The progression of\nreplacement root resorption in young children can be rapid, especially when\ndiagnosed before the age of 10. 60, level II-2\nOn the contrary, tooth ankylosis in older patients may be considered an\nacceptable outcome. This age group has achieved skeletal maturity and the\nreplacement resorption progress is slow. Minor infra-occlusion may not\ncause major aesthetic concerns. The ankylosed tooth can survive for a\nnumber of years, before total bony replacement of root occurs. Eventually,\nthe crown may be lost spontaneously or by surgical intervention.60, level II-2\nIn the management of ankylosed replanted avulsed permanent anterior\nteeth, clinicians should base the treatment planning on their experience and\nskill, patients\u2019 preferences and perspectives.", "chunk_order": 19}

Tooth autotransplantation\nTooth autotransplantation in healthy growing children and adolescents may\nbe considered for the replacement of ankylosed replanted avulsed permanent\nanterior tooth, when appropriate donor is available. Premolar is the most\ncommon donor tooth in autotransplantation. Orthodontic consultation is\nrequired in the treatment planning as part of a multidisciplinary team\napproach, before performing premolar autotransplantation. A meta-analysis of autotransplantation of teeth with incomplete root\nformation reported a 10-year survival rate of 96.3% (CI 89.8 \u2013 98.7%), whilst\nthe weighted estimated success rate per year was 96.6% (CI 97.8 \u2013 94.8%). The rate of complications such as ankylosis, root resorption, and pulp\nnecrosis was found to be low (<5%).61, level II-2\nA systematic review of premolar autotransplantation to anterior maxilla\nshowed survival rate of 96.7% at 9 months - 22 years of follow-up.

Recommendation 5\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\nDecoronation must be weighed against the need for temporary prosthetic\nreplacement in young growing patients, when permanent prosthesis such as\nimplant is contraindicated. 7.3. Tooth Loss (Interim and Long-term Treatment Options)\nFailure to replant or failure following replantation of avulsed permanent tooth\nwill lead to premature loss of permanent maxillary anterior tooth. Alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) procedures following tooth loss have been\nintroduced to minimise alveolar ridge atrophy to facilitate future implant\nplacement. Various techniques or materials used for ARP can be categorised\ninto three:- 75, level II-2\nBone grafts/ substitutes (i.e. autologous bone and platelet-rich\nplasma or PRP)\nGuided Bone Regeneration (GBR) (i.e. collagen membrane)\nBiological active materials (i.e. bone morphogenic protein). In a systematic review on ARP, the reduction in ridge width and height\nfollowing different ARP techniques may be less than that which occurs\nfollowing natural socket healing. However, ARP does not totally eliminate\npost-extraction alveolar ridge resorption or predictably promote new bone\nformation.75, level II-2 Clinicians may consider ARP in situations requiring that\nimplant placement is significantly delayed after tooth extraction, such as, due\nto the young age of the patient.76, level III\nLong-term treatment options can be considered for the treatment of lost\ntooth. The treatment options are as follows:\nSpace maintenance using:\nremovable or fixed denture prosthesis (FDPs)\ntooth autotransplantation (e.g. autotransplantation of developing\npremolar)\nimplant prosthesis\nOrthodontic space closure\nOrthodontic space closure in combination with prosthesis/ tooth\nautotransplantation/ implant (for cases involving loss of multiple\nmaxillary anterior teeth)\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\nTooth avulsion of permanent anterior tooth occurs most commonly in children\nand adolescents, during which facial growth is not completed. Therefore,\npatients may have to wear non-invasive interim restorations during this\ngrowth period prior to more definitive treatment. The interim restorations\navailable are:\nremovable retainer\nmetal resin-bonded FDPs\nceramic resin-bonded FDPs\nfibre-reinforced composite resin-bonded restorations\nSurvival rates for both resin-bonded FDPs and composite resin-bonded\nrestorations are 73% at 4.5 years.77, level III The success rate of tooth\nautotransplantation when using premolar to replace maxillary incisors can be\nvery high (i.e. 100% at 4.8 years).71, level II-2\nAs for implants, it should not be placed until the skeletal growth is completed.

Thus, this is a major disadvantage of planning aesthetic treatment with\nimplants as an option for the management of unsuccessful replanted avulsed\npermanent anterior tooth among children and adolescents. Therefore,\npatient\u2019s age should be considered in the treatment strategy for anterior\npermanent tooth loss due to avulsion or failed replanted avulsed permanent\nanterior tooth. It is important to standardise the management of avulsed permanent anterior\nteeth at all healthcare levels in Malaysia using an evidence-based CPG in\norder to manage it appropriately. The outcomes of treatment are mostly dependent on the timely and\nappropriate management of the avulsed permanent anterior teeth. Recognition of the prognostic factors such as extra-alveolar time,\nappropriate storage media and root canal treatment by clinicians, the\nknowledge of what to do when a problem occurs, and the appropriate\nresponses from the health professionals are major factors in the\nmanagement of avulsed permanent anterior teeth. This professional\nawareness is influenced by factors such as maintaining current\nunderstanding of the nature of avulsed teeth, the appropriate management,\ncontinuing professional education and an understanding of parents\u2019 and\npatient\u2019s expectations. 8. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\n2019\nManagement of Avulsed Permanent Anterior Teeth\nTherefore, it is important for these guidelines to be disseminated to all\nhealthcare professionals in primary and secondary healthcare facilities. This\ncan further be facilitated through the development of appropriate training\nmodules and quick references. These guidelines will also be beneficial to the\npublic by making this CPG available in a structured, user-friendly manner on\nthe internet. Several factors may affect the implementation of the recommendations of the\nCPG\n8.1. Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\nwide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare professionals and\nteaching institutions via printed and electronic copies\ncontinuing professional education on the management of avulsed\npermanent anterior teeth for healthcare professionals\nadequate facilities at primary and secondary care level for diagnosing\nand treating avulsed permanent anterior teeth\ninvolvement\nof\nnon-government\norganisations\ne.g. Malaysian\nAssociation of Paediatric Dentistry in Dental Trauma Talk and\nWorkshop\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\nlack of understanding or limited knowledge on the management of\navulsed permanent anterior teeth\nvariation in skills and treatment practices\nconstraints in equipment and facilities\na)\nb)\nc)\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG include:\nensure widespread distribution of the CPG in hard and soft copy to\nhealthcare professionals in primary and secondary healthcare facilities\nstrengthen training of healthcare professionals to ensure knowledge\nand information is up to date. empower community with active involvement in trauma prevention and\nmanagement related activities\na)\nb)\nc)\n8.2.
