In Malaysia the Dialysis and Transplant Registry 2002\nreported that diabetic nephropathy was the predominant cause of ESRD\naccounting for 47% of new cases.(2) This places an enormous burden on\nclinical, public health and economic resources as such patients often have\nmultiple co-morbid conditions such as coronary artery and peripheral\nvascular disease. Thus the Malaysian Society of Nephrology council deemed it appropriate\nthat a Clinical Practice Guideline on Diabetic Nephropathy be drawn up\nto guide healthcare professionals, with the major objectives being\nscreening for diabetic nephropathy and instituting measures to prevent or\nretard its progression. This task was given to the Penang nephrologists as it dawned on the\ncouncil that the small island had a nephrologist in every corner! Apart\nfrom nephrologists, the panel included an endocrinologist, a family\nphysician, an outpatient general practitioner, a cardiologist, and a\nphysician with interest in diabetes mellitus. The committee has attempted\nto combine evidence based medicine with the practical strategies available\nlocally to formulate these recommendations. These fourteen recommendations are intended to assist primary health\ncare doctors who manage diabetic patients in their day-to-day practice to\nintervene early and effectively so that the onset and the course of diabetic\nnephropathy can be ameliorated. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the panel members for their\nhard work and commitment in preparing the guidelines. I would also like\nto thank the secretariat for services rendered, all those who contributed to\nthe final draft presentation and finally to the Malaysian Society of\nNephrology council for their infinite patience in waiting for the\nappearance of this guideline!

It occurs in 30% of type 1 diabetics, 5 to\n15 years after diagnosis but may be present at diagnosis in type 2\ndiabetics as the time of onset of type 2 diabetes is often unknown. \u2022\nMicroalbuminuria progresses to overt proteinuria over the next 7 to 10\nyears (Figure 1). \u2022\nOnce overt proteinuria develops, renal function progressively declines\nand end stage renal failure is reached after about 10 years. 2\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\nINTRODUCTION\n\u2022\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the prevalence of diabetes\nworldwide. In Malaysia the prevalence of diabetes has increased from\n6.3% in 1986 to 8.3% in 1996.(3)\n\u2022\nWith improvement in the survival of patients with diabetes,\nnephropathy has now emerged as a major health problem. \u2022\nNephropathy develops in about 20-40% of diabetics. Known risk\nfactors for the development of diabetic nephropathy include genetic\npredisposition, poor glycaemic control, hypertension and smoking.", "chunk_order": 3}

Known risk\nfactors for the development of diabetic nephropathy include genetic\npredisposition, poor glycaemic control, hypertension and smoking. \u2022\nPrevention, early detection and aggressive intervention are needed to\nretard the progression of diabetic nephropathy to end stage renal\nfailure. \u2022\nCardiovascular disease is the commonest cause of death in patients\nwith diabetic nephropathy. Thus it is necessary to address the\nassociated risk factors for this condition. DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\n\u2022\nThe diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is usually made clinically. Other\ntarget organ involvement is often present. 90-95% of type 1 diabetics\nand about 70% of type 2 diabetics with nephropathy will have\nretinopathy as well. In the absence of retinopathy, non-diabetic renal\ndisease may need to be excluded. \u2022\nNon-diabetic renal disease should also be considered when :-\n- significant haematuria or urinary red blood cell casts are present\n- renal failure occurs in the absence of proteinuria\n- there is evidence of other systemic disease e.g. systemic lupus\nerythematosus, myeloma, viral hepatitis\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\nPREVENTION OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\n\u2022\nOne of the most important aspects in the management of diabetes\nmellitus is to prevent macrovascular and microvascular complications\nincluding diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. \u2022\nThis may require a multidisciplinary team approach which includes\ngeneral practitioners, physicians, endocrinologists, dietitians and\ntrained diabetic nurses. \u2022\nThe focus of management should be on good glycaemic control which\nincludes patient education, lifestyle modification, diet, exercise,\nattainment of ideal body weight and frequent self-monitoring of blood\nglucose. \u2022\nThe strongest evidence in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy and\nother microvascular complications has been with tight glycaemic\ncontrol. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in type\n1 diabetics(5,6) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study\n(UKPDS) in type 2 diabetics(7) have shown that intensive blood glucose\ncontrol reduces the risk of developing nephropathy, retinopathy and\nneuropathy. \u2022\nStrategies to prevent diabetic nephropathy also include monitoring and\ntight control of blood pressure. 4\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\nAdapted from SIGN Guidelines(1)\nFigure 1.

With the onset of overt proteinuria, hypertension is\nusually present and worsens as the nephropathy progresses. However in\ntype 2 diabetics, hypertension may precede the onset of diabetic\nnephropathy and is often associated with the metabolic syndrome of\nobesity, insulin resistance and hyperlipidaemia. Target blood pressure in diabetics should be less than 130/80mmHg\nRecommendation 5 : Target blood pressure\nGrade A\nDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY\nLandmark studies of ACEIs in type 1( 4 2 ) and ARBs in type 2\ndiabetics(43,44) have shown the effectiveness of these agents to retard the\nprogression of overt diabetic nephropathy. In these trials, there were\nsignificant reductions in the risk of doubling of plasma creatinine and\ndeveloping renal failure. These benefits were independent of blood\npressure lowering. \u2022\nThe role of ACEIs in type 2 diabetics with overt nephropathy is less\nclear. As yet, large long-term studies on hard renal endpoints have not\nbeen performed. Small scale studies have shown beneficial effect on\nproteinuria but data on retardation of progression of renal failure is\nlimited.(36,45-49) Despite the lack of direct evidence, an ACEI is a\nreasonable alternative to an ARB as it is cheaper and more widely\navailable. \u2022\nCurrent data suggests that ACEI/ARB should be instituted even in\npatients with moderately severe renal failure.(43,44) However renal\nfunction should be monitored closely.
