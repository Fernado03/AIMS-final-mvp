There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary\nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the electronic\ndatabases, mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of Systemic\nReviews, and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International Network\n(refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The search\nwas limited to literature published in the last ten years, on humans and\nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies.

In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts\nin the field were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches\nwere conducted from 22 September 2015 to 20 Jun 2017. Literature\nsearches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG\ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before\n31 December 2017 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search\nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other CPGs on atopic eczema e.g.:\n\u2022 Management of atopic eczema in primary care (Scottish Intercollegiate\nGuidelines Network, 2011)\n\u2022 Atopic eczema in children: management of atopic eczema in children\nfrom birth up to the age of 12 years (National Collaborating Centre\nfor Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health, 2007)\n\u2022 Guidelines of care for atopic dermatitis (Journal of American\nAcademy of Dermatology, 2014)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as\nreferences. A total of 13 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within these\nsections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 19 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely\nManagement of Atopic Eczema\non the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials,\nwith local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties.

INTRODUCTION\nAtopic eczema (AE) or atopic dermatitis is a complex, chronic and\nrecurrent inflammatory itchy skin disorder. This is the commonest type\nof endogenous eczema. In majority of cases, AE starts to develop in\nearly childhood and may persist into adulthood. The prevalence of AE\ncan be as high as 20% in some countries and this continues to rise\naffecting not only developed but also developing low-income countries. According to International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood\n(ISAAC), the 12-month prevalence of AE among Malaysian children\nhas risen from 9.5% in ISAAC-1 (1994 - 1995) to 12.6% in ISAAC-3\n(2002 - 2003), with an increase of 0.49% yearly.1 AE can present with\nvarious clinical manifestations according to different age groups. This\nmakes the diagnosis of AE a challenge, leading to misdiagnosis and\nmistreatment. AE significantly impacts the financial and psychosocial\nwell-being of the patients and families. The direct healthcare cost\nfor a child with AE in developing countries (Malaysia, Indonesia\nand Philippines) has been estimated to range from USD199 to\nUSD743.2 The psychosocial impact on the children with AE and their\nfamilies is as great as children with diabetes. Therefore, it is paramount\nto have an effective and safe treatment of AE.3\nAE is typically an episodic disease of flares and remission. However,\nit may be continuous in some patients. A multicentre allergy study\ndone in Germany, involving 1314 children from birth to seven years\nold, showed 43.2% of cases went into complete remission by three\nyears of age, 38.3% had an intermittent pattern of disease and\n18.7% had symptoms of AE every year.4 The disease is caused by\ncomplex interactions of genetic predispositions, environmental triggers\nand immune dysregulation leading to epidermal barrier defect. The\ndefect in epidermal barrier may be caused by genetic alterations in\nthe filaggrin gene. Based on a study done in Singapore, 20.2% of AE\npatients cohort carried at least one filaggrin-null mutation compared\nwith 7.3% of the control population.5 Besides genetic determination,\nthe epidermal barrier function also depends on the immune system.", "chunk_order": 6}

Based on a study done in Singapore, 20.2% of AE\npatients cohort carried at least one filaggrin-null mutation compared\nwith 7.3% of the control population.5 Besides genetic determination,\nthe epidermal barrier function also depends on the immune system. It\nhas been demonstrated that T-helper 2 cytokines such as interleukin-4\ninhibit the expression of filaggrin and S100 proteins and thus impair\nthe epidermal barrier. Mechanical (e.g. scratching) or physical (e.g. hot water, ultraviolet exposure, sweating) irritation further weakens\nthe epidermal barrier. With the breakdown of skin barrier, affected skin\nis more susceptible to trigger factors including irritants and allergens,\nwhich can further aggravate AE.6\nClinically, AE has both acute and chronic presentations. Acute eczema\nis characterised by papulo-vesicular eruption with erythema, weeping,\noedema and excoriation. Whereas chronic eczema is characterised by\nManagement of Atopic Eczema\nlichenification and dry skin (xerosis). The choice of treatment depends\non the clinical presentation of AE. The aim of this CPG is to provide an evidence-based guidance for all\nphysicians and other healthcare providers in the management of AE. Management of Atopic Eczema\n2. DIAGNOSIS\n2.1 Diagnostic Criteria\nAE is diagnosed clinically. In a systematic review, the most extensively\nvalidated diagnostic tools were \u2018U.K. Working Party\u2019s Diagnostic Criteria\u2019\n(refer to yellow box below) and \u2018Hanifin and Rajka Diagnostic Criteria\u2019\n(refer to Appendix 3).

Management of Atopic Eczema\n6. TOPICAL THERAPY\nTopical therapy is the mainstay of treatment in AE. This includes\nemollient, topical anti-inflammatory agents and topical antiseptic/\nantimicrobial agents. For further information on recommended\nmedication dosing, side effects and contraindications for commonly\nused medications in AE, refer to Appendix 11. 6.1 Emollient/Moisturiser\nEmollient therapy is the mainstay of management in AE. It improves the\nepidermal barrier function and dryness leading to reduction in pruritus. Emollients application decreases the usage of topical corticosteroids\n(TCS). Emollients are available in different formulations (ointments, creams,\nlotions, gels and aerosol sprays). Ointments (e.g. petrolatum) are\ngreasy in nature whereas creams and lotions contain water and are\nmore user-friendly and acceptable cosmetically. Creams (e.g. aqueous\ncream and urea cream), lotions and gels contain preservatives to\nprotect against microbial growth in the presence of water.

Management of Atopic Eczema\nChildren have an increased absorption of TCS due to a greater body\nsurface area to weight ratio. Therefore, the least-potent but effective\nTCS should be used. However, during acute flares, the use of short\ncourses of moderate to very potent TCS can be considered for rapid\ncontrol. For certain areas (i.e. face, neck, genitalia and skin folds),\ncaution should be exercised with regards to choice of TCS potency due\nto greater penetration and higher likelihood for systemic absorption.31\nLocal adverse effects of TCS are secondary infection, skin\natrophy, striae, burning, itching, folliculitis, acne-like eruptions and\ntelangiectasia.

NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS\n11.1 Bathing Practices\nLonger duration of bathing (>10 minutes) may be associated with risk of\ngreater AE severity (p=0.0562).72, level III However, frequency of bathing\nis not associated with the severity.73, level I There is no evidence on\nclinical benefit of emollient bath additives in AE. There is no retrievable evidence with regards to appropriate water\ntemperature. However, the CPG development group advices against\nthe use of extreme temperatures (too hot or too cold) during bathing to\navoid worsening of AE. 11.2 Dietary Interventions\na. Food Avoidance\n\u2022 Maternal dietary avoidance\nA Cochrane systematic review showed no significant protective effect\nof maternal dietary antigen avoidance (e.g. cow\u2019s milk, egg, peanuts,\nfish and chocolate) during pregnancy and lactation on incidence of\nAE during first 18 months of life. The review also found no significant\nreduction in eczema severity in infants with established AE with\nmaternal dietary antigen avoidance during lactation.74, level I\n\u2022 Food avoidance in established eczema\nIn another Cochrane systematic review, there was no significant\nbeneficial effect in elimination of food in mother\u2019s diet (e.g. wheat, fish,\nbeef, chicken, nuts, chocolate, citrus food, colouring and preservatives)\nor use of few foods diet which only includes 5 - 6 foods (lamb, potato,\nrice, one of the brassicas, pear and tap water) and elemental diet in AE. The RCTs in the review were of poor quality.75, level I\nThere may be some benefits in using an egg-free diet in infants with\npositive specific IgE to eggs. However, there was little evidence to\nsupport the use of various exclusion diets in unselected patients with\nAE.75, level I\nb. Breastfeeding\nExclusive breastfeeding for three months or more may help to prevent\nthe development of AE in infants with family history of atopy.14\nHowever, a meta-analysis showed that there was no evidence on protective\neffect of exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3 months against AE, even\namong children with a positive family history.76, level II-2\nManagement of Atopic Eczema\nA Cochrane systematic review on breastfeeding duration showed no\nsignificant difference in the reduction of AE risk in the first 12 months of\nlife and at 5 - 7 years of age when infants exclusively breastfed for 3 - 4\nmonths compared with 6 - 7 months.74, level I\nc. Soy Formula\nA Cochrane systematic review showed no significant difference\nbetween soy and cow\u2019s milk formulas in prevention of childhood AE.77, level I\nd.", "chunk_order": 23}

Hydrolysed Formula\nA systematic review showed some evidences that partially hydrolysed\n100% whey protein infant formula (pHF-W) reduced risk of AE compared\nwith intact protein cow\u2019s milk formula among infants with risk of\natopy.78, level I\nThis is supported by a recent meta-analysis of moderate quality RCTs\ndemonstrating a trend in reduction of eczema in infants with high\nrisk of developing allergy fed with pHF-W compared with cow\u2019s milk\nformula.79, level I\nIn the prevention of AE, hydrolysed formulas should not be offered to\ninfants in preference to breast milk.14\ne. Complementary Feeding\nThe AE risk is reduced with early introduction of complementary food\nat the age of four and/or five months compared to those on exclusive\nbreastfeeding (up to six months). However, stronger evidence is\nrequired.80, level II-2\nf. Probiotic and Prebiotic\nProbiotic and prebiotic are food supplements/food that modify and\nreinstate the pre-existing intestinal flora. Probiotics are live \u2018good\u2019 bacteria\nwhich include lactobacilli sp. and bifidobacteria. Prebiotics are dietary\nfibre (non-digestible oligosaccharides and fructooligosaccharides)\nwhich stimulates the growth or activity of bacteria in the colon. \u2022 Probiotic\nA meta-analysis on probiotics (e.g. non-spore lactobacillicus,\nbifidobacterium and mixed lactobacilli) given to healthy infants (<2\nyears old) and pregnant women found a reduction in the incidence of\nAE (RRR=0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.78). However, the primary papers\nused were of poor quality with significant heterogeneity.81, level I\n\u2022 Prebiotic\nTwo systematic reviews on the prevention of AE using supplementation\nof expressed breast milk or infant formula with prebiotics showed\nreduction in incidence of AE but the results were not significant.81 - 82, level I\nManagement of Atopic Eczema\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic and prebiotic in\nthe management of AE. Limitations of the included studies in the above\nreviews are heterogeneity in the strains used, dose and duration of\nintervention. g. Other Dietary Intervention\n\u2022 Fish Oil\nFish oils are rich in omega-3 fatty acids namely eicosapentaenoic\nacid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These may reduce the\ninflammatory components of AE. Two small studies in a Cochrane\nsystematic review showed that fish oil improved symptoms and quality\nof life at 12 - 16 weeks when compared with placebo in adults with\nAE.83, level I\n\u2022 Mineral\nMinerals such as zinc and selenium show no significant difference in\nreducing disease severity in AE.83, level I\n\u2022 Vitamins\nThere is insufficient evidence to suggest the use of vitamin B6, D and\nE in AE.83, level I\n\u2022 Maternal dietary supplementation\nTwo systematic reviews showed no significant association between\nmaternal intake of vitamins and nutrients during pregnancy, lactation or\nboth pregnancy and lactation, and reduction of incidence of childhood\nAE.84 - 85, level I\n\u2022 There is insufficient evidence to recommend dietary supplements in\nthe management of AE.", "chunk_order": 24}

In a Cochrane systematic review of 10 RCTs, psychological techniques\nare used to manage itching and scratching or sleep disturbance. Educational interventions are also used to help parents and children\nto understand the condition and their role in managing it successfully. However, there was lack of rigorously designed trials on effectiveness\nof educational and psychological interventions in the management of\nAE in children.86, level I\nIn the guidelines of care for the management of AE, educational\nprogrammes and eczema workshops are recommended as adjunct to\nthe conventional therapy in the management of AE.87\nA major challenge in AE management is its complex treatment,\nManagement of Atopic Eczema\nwhich must be tailored for both acute exacerbations and long-term\nmaintenance. Patient education plays an important role in the\nself-management of AE. The addition of a written eczema action\nplan (WEAP) to the routine verbal instruction may enhance patients\u2019\nunderstanding and empower patients/caregivers to better manage\ntheir condition thus reducing the frequency and severity of flares, and\nfrequency of clinical encounters (refer to Appendix 10). Recommendation 11\n\u2022 Educational interventions should be considered as part of the\nmanagement of atopic eczema. Management of Atopic Eczema\n12. TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE\nTraditional and complementary medicine (TCM) refers to the broad set\nof health practices that are not part of conventional medicine or practice\nand are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system. In\nsome instances, TCM is often interchangeable with traditional medicine. 12.1 Herbal and Food Supplementation\na.
