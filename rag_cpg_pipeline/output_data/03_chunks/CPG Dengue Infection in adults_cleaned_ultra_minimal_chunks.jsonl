Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were issued in 2015 and subject to be reviewed in\nminimum four (4) years time or in the advent of any significant change\nin management of patient. When it is due for updating, the Chairman\nof the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty will be informed\nabout it. A discussion will be done on the need for a revision including\nthe scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed\nand the latest systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be\nemployed. TABLE OF CONTENTS\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n1.

In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts\nin the field were also contacted to identify relevant studies. In certain\nsituations, pivotal papers beyond the scope of search were used in the\nCPG. All searches were conducted from 26 May 2015 to 24 July 2015. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat. The previous edition of CPG (2010) was used as the basis in updating\nthese present guidelines. Reference was also made to other guidelines\non dengue infection in adults as well as handbooks from WHO such as\nDengue Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and Control\n(2009) and Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue (2012). A total of 18 clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions)\nThe DG members met 7 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nThe literature used in these guidelines was graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and\nCPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval. Details on\nthe CPG development by MaHTAS can be obtained from Manual on\nDevelopment and Implementation of Evidence-based Clinical Practice\nGuidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh.gov.my/\nindex.php/pages/view/117).

Dengue is one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases in\nterms of public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. It affects\ntropical and subtropical regions around the world, predominantly in urban\nareas. The global increase of dengue incidence is also experienced by Malaysia. Since the year 2000, the dengue incidence in Malaysia continues to\nincrease from 32 cases per 100,000 population to 361 cases per 100,000\npopulation in 2014 (Figure 1). The dengue incidence rate is higher in the\nage group of 15 and above. Most of the dengue cases reported were from\nurban areas (70%\u201380%) where factors such as high density population and\nrapid development favour dengue transmission. With regards to case fatality rate, the national target is less than 0.2%.", "chunk_order": 4}

Dengue infection is caused by dengue virus which is a mosquito-borne\nflavivirus. It is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. There\nare four distinct serotypes, DENV-1,2,3 and 4. Each episode of infection\ninduces a life-long protective immunity to the homologous serotype but\nconfers only partial and transient protection against other serotypes. Secondary infection is a major risk factor for severe dengue due to\nantibody-dependent enhancement. Other important contributing factors are\nviral virulence, host genetic background, T-cell activation, viral load and\nauto-antibodies. In Malaysia, all four serotypes can be isolated at any one time. However,\na particular dengue virus serotype can predominate for at least two years\nbefore it is replaced by another serotype (Figure 3). In year 2013-2014,\nthe predominant serotype had switched twice from DENV-2 to DENV-1 in\nFebruary and June 2014 (Figure 4). Figure 3: Dengue Serotypes in Malaysia (1990-2014)\nFigure 4: Dengue Serotypes in Year 2013, 2014 and 2015 (Jan-June)\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\n3. 3.1 SPECTRUM OF DENGUE INFECTION\nThe incubation period for dengue infection is 4-7 days (range 3-14).1 It\nmay be asymptomatic or may result in a spectrum of illness ranging from\nundifferentiated mild febrile illness to severe disease, with or without\nplasma leakage and organ impairment. Symptomatic dengue infection\nis a systemic and dynamic disease with clinical, haematological and\nserological profiles changing from day to day. These changes accelerate\nwithin hours or even minutes during the critical phase, particularly in those\nwith plasma leakage (refer to subchapter 3.3). Understanding the systemic and dynamic nature of dengue disease as well\nas its pathophysiological changes during each phase of the disease will\nproduce a rational approach in the management of dengue infection. 3.2 CLINICAL COURSE OF DENGUE INFECTION\nAfter the incubation period, the illness begins abruptly and will be followed\nby three phases: febrile, critical and recovery phase (refer to Figure 5).2,3\ni. Febrile Phase\nPatients develop high grade fever suddenly and usually last 2-7 days.", "chunk_order": 5}

Febrile Phase\nPatients develop high grade fever suddenly and usually last 2-7 days. It\nis often accompanied by facial flushing, rash, generalised body ache,\nvomiting and headache. 2,3 Some patients may have sore throat, injected\npharynx and conjunctival injection. Mild haemorrhagic manifestations like petechiae and mucosal membrane\nbleeding may be seen during the illness.4,5 Per vaginal bleeding may occur\nin females but rarely massive. Gastrointestinal bleeding is not uncommon.5,6\nThe findings of tender liver are warning signs of dengue infection. The earliest abnormality in the full blood count is a progressive decrease\nin total white cell count followed by platelet reduction. This should alert the\nphysician to a high index of suspicion of dengue infection. This disease\nshould be notified as early as possible for preventive measures. ii. Critical Phase\nThe critical phase often occurs after third day of fever (may occur earlier)\nor around defervescence indicated by a rapid drop in temperature. This\ncoincides with an increase in capillary permeability in some patients. In\nother viral infections, the patient\u2019s condition improves as the temperature\nsubsides, but the contrary happens in severe dengue infection wherein the\npatient may deteriorate and manifest third space plasma leakage or organ\ndysfunction.2,3,7,8\nThe critical phase lasts about 24-48 hours (refer to Figure 5). Varying\ncirculatory disturbances (refer to Table 1) can develop. In less severe\ncases, these changes are minimal and transient. Many of these patients\neither recover spontaneously or after a short period of fluid or electrolyte\ntherapy. In more severe forms of plasma leakage, the patients may\ndevelop compensated or decompensated shock (Table 1). Abdominal pain,\npersistent vomiting and/or diarrhoea, restlessness, altered conscious level,\nclinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed or tender liver are the clinical\nwarning signs of dengue infection with high possibility of complications.8-10\nOrgan dysfunctions such as hepatitis, encephalitis and myocarditis usually\nbut not exclusively occur during this phase. It is important to note that thrombocytopaenia and haemoconcentration are\nusually detectable in this phase. The haematocrit (HCT) level correlates\nwell with plasma volume loss and disease severity. However, interpretation\nof HCT may be difficult when there are confounding factors such as\nhaemorrhage, excessive fluid replacement or in haemodilutional state. Leucopaenia with relative lymphocytosis, clotting abnormalities, elevation\nof transaminases [typically the level of aspartate aminotransaminase\n(AST) is higher than the level of alanine aminotransaminase (ALT)],\nhypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia are usually observed.2-4\niii. Recovery/Reabsorption Phase\nAfter 24-48 hours of critical phase, usually plasma leakage stops followed\nby reabsorption of extravascular fluid.", "chunk_order": 6}

Recovery/Reabsorption Phase\nAfter 24-48 hours of critical phase, usually plasma leakage stops followed\nby reabsorption of extravascular fluid. Patient\u2019s general well being improves,\nappetite returns, gastrointestinal symptoms improve, haemodynamic status\nstabilises and diuresis ensues. Some patient may have a classical rash of\n\u201cisles of white in the sea of red\u201d with generalised pruritus.2 It is important to\nnote that during this phase, HCT level stabilises and drops further due to\nhaemodilution following reabsorption of extravascular fluid. The recovery of\nplatelet count is typically preceded by recovery of white cell count (WCC). In some instances, organ dysfunctions may worsen (hepatitis, encephalitis\nand intracranial bleed) as the patient enters reabsorption phase. Figure 5 : Clinical Course of DHF 11-13\n3.3 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PLASMA LEAKAGE IN SEVERE\nDENGUE INFECTION\nThe primary pathophysiological abnormality seen in dengue infection is\nan acute increase in vascular permeability that leads to leakage of plasma\ninto the extravascular compartment, resulting in haemoconcentration and\nhypovolaemia or shock.2,3,14 Hypovolaemia leads to reflex tachycardia and\ngeneralised vasoconstriction due to increased sympathetic output.15,16\nClinical manifestations of vasoconstriction in various systems are as follows:\nSkin - coolness, pallor and delayed capillary refill time\n\u2022\nCardiovascular system - raised diastolic blood pressure and a\n\u2022\nnarrowing of pulse pressure\nRenal system - reducing urine output\n\u2022\nGastrointestinal system - persistent vomiting, persistent diarrhoea and\n\u2022\nabdominal pain\nCentral nervous system \u2013 lethargy, restlessness, apprehension,\n\u2022\nreduced level of consciousness\nRespiratory system \u2013 tachypnoea (respiratory rate >20/min)\n\u2022\nInadequate perfusion of the tissue leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis\nand lactic acidosis. If the hypovolaemia is not corrected promptly, the\npatient will progress to a refractory shock state. By then, the tissue\nperfusion would not respond to vasopressor drugs, even if the blood\npressure and intravascular volume were to be restored and cardiac output\nwould remain depressed. The resultant lactic acidosis further depresses\nthe myocardium and worsens the hypotension.16\nThe common late complications of prolonged shock are massive bleeding,\ndisseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and multi-organ failure\nwhich are often fatal. The pathophysiology of organ dysfunction will be\ndescribed in subchapter 7.6. The following Table 1 is the summary of the continuum of various\npathophysiological changes in a patient who progresses from normal\ncirculatory state to hypovolaemic shock. The critical phase often occurs after third day of fever (may occur\n\u2022\nearlier) or around defervescence with a rapid drop in temperature.

London: McGraw-Hill; 2005:p.630-46. 3.4 WHO DENGUE CLASSIFICATION\nBased on 1997 WHO dengue classification scheme (refer to Appendix 3),\nthe key differentiating feature between DF and DHF is the presence of plasma\nleakage in DHF. However, in the early febrile phase of dengue infection, the\nsymptoms can overlap and one cannot differentiate DF and DHF. 3.4.1 Limitations of 1997 WHO classification 23, level I\nIt has been observed that the 1997 WHO classification scheme has several\nlimitations. Dengue with shock without fulfilling all the four criteria for DHF\ni. Severe organ impairment without shock\nii. The 1997 classification scheme does not address the entire spectrum\niii. of the disease. 3.4.2 WHO Classification 2009\nThis classification addresses the levels of severity of dengue infection which\nis more practical to be used in the management decision of the patient\n(Figure 6). Figure 6: 2009 WHO Dengue Classification and Level of Severity 24\nAdapted: World Health Organization. Dengue Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment,\nPrevention and Control - New Edition 2009. WHO: Geneva; 2009\n3.5 DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES\nClinical features of dengue infection are rather non-specific and mimic\nmany other diseases, therefore can be easily misinterpreted. A high index\nof suspicion and appropriate history taking, particularly with regards to a\nrecent stay in dengue hotspots or clusters of fever in neighbourhood, are\nuseful for early and accurate diagnosis of dengue infection. In addition, a dengue patient may have a co-infection with another\npathogen. Diseases that may mimic dengue infection includes other viral\nillnesses. Organ dysfunction can occur in other diseases apart from dengue\ninfection and should be investigated. 4. DISEASE NOTIFICATION\nAll suspected dengue cases from private and public health facilities must\nbe notified by telephone/fax/e-notification to the nearest health office within\n24 hours of diagnosis, followed by written notification using the standard\nnotification format. Failure to notify is liable to be compounded under the\nPrevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act, 1988 (Act 342).25\nAny delay in notification will increase the risk of dengue transmission in\nthe locality of the residence. It is also important to update the notification if\nthere is a change in severity of dengue infection or when there is dengue\ndeath. Notified cases will be followed up by the health authorities for the\nverification of case definition and preventive measures. Since 2014,\nthe Ministry of Health Malaysia has set up new criteria for dengue cases\nregistration, whereby all registered dengue cases must be confirmed by\nlaboratory investigations. All dengue deaths need to be notified as soon as possible by the treating\ndoctor in the hospital to the district health office and/or State Health\nDirector and must be investigated by District Health Officer or Epidemiology\nOfficer.26\nDengue mortality audit should be conducted within seven days after\nthe dengue death has occurred at hospital level followed by state level,\nchaired by Hospital Director and State Health Director respectively.", "chunk_order": 9}

INVESTIGATIONS\n5.1 DISEASE MONITORING TESTS\nWhite cell count (WCC) and Platelet count:\ni. In the early febrile phase WCC and platelet count are usually normal\nbut will decrease rapidly as the disease progresses.4, level III The\ndecrease in WCC is accompanied by platelet reduction. There is no correlation between disease severity and platelet count\n2,level III;25,level III and it is not predictive of bleeding.28,level I;29,level II-2;30-32,level III In\nrecovery phase, the WCC normalises followed by platelet. Haematocrit (HCT):\nii. A rising HCT is a marker of plasma leakage in dengue infection. The median\nvalues of normal HCT level among Malaysian populations are: 33,level II-2\nmale\n\u2022\n< 60 years \u2013 46%\nmale > 60 years \u2013 42%\n\u2022\nfemale (all age groups) \u2013 40%\n\u2022\nOther important blood tests in disease monitoring are Liver Function Test\n(LFT), Renal profile (RP), coagulation profile, lactate and blood gases\n(Table 6). Special tests such as Troponin and Creatine Kinase (CK) should\nbe discussed with the Specialists/Registrars before performing. Recommendation 1\nBaseline haematocrit (HCT) and white cell count should be established\n\u2022\nduring the first visit in all patients with suspected dengue infection. Serial full blood count and HCT must be monitored as dengue infection\n\u2022\nprogresses. 5.2 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS\nDiagnostic tests include point of care testing such as dengue NS1 antigen\ntest and rapid combo tests (NS1 antigen and dengue IgM/IgG antibodies). Other laboratory tests include NS1 antigen test, dengue antibody detection\ntests including IgM and IgG ELISA, dengue genome detection assay (real\ntime RT-PCR) and dengue viral isolation assay. Specifications for an ideal\ndengue test include the ability to differentiate between dengue and other\ndiseases with similar clinical presentation, to detect during the acute stage\nof infection, provides rapid results, inexpensive and easy to use. However,\nthe interpretation of diagnostic results should be done with the clinical\ncontext. 5.2.1Rapid Combo Test (RCT)\nRapid combo tests are assays that can detect the presence of virus as well\nas antibodies simultaneously.34-35,level II-2 Generally RCT tests can be read\nwithin 15-20 minutes.

However, it is important that the tests have to be\nread according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation in the product insert. Reading too late gives false results. Interpretation of the results is through the presence or absence of bands\nfor dengue NS1 antigen and dengue IgM and IgG antibodies.34-35,level II-2\nThese tests have a longer detection window as they can detect both the\nvirus and antibodies, thus reducing the possibility of false negative results. Hence these tests are useful during the early phase of onset when there is\nviraemia as well as at a later stage when antibodies against dengue begin\nto rise. Suitable samples that can be used for testing include whole blood,\nserum and plasma. The sensitivity is 93.9% and specificity is 92%.36,level II-2\n5.2.2 Dengue Antigen and Serology Tests by ELISA\nBoth antigen and serological tests are more commonly used to diagnose\ndengue infections. The tests include antigen detection (NS1) or antibody\ndetection. Usually different patterns of antibody response are seen in primary\ndengue infection as compared to secondary dengue infection. 37,level II-2\ni. Non-Structural Protein-1 (NS1 Antigen)\nNS1 antigen is a highly conserved glycoprotein that seems to be essential\nfor virus viability. Secretion of the NS1 protein is a hallmark of flavivirus\ninfecting mammalian cells and can be found in dengue infection as well as\nin yellow fever and West Nile virus infection. False positive results have\nbeen reported in chronic diseases and haematological malignancies.38,level III\nThe detection rate is much better in acute sera of primary infection\n(75%-97%) when compared to the acute sera of secondary infection\n(60%-70%).39-41,level III The sensitivity of NS1 antigen detection drops from\nday 4-5 of illness onwards and usually becomes undetectable in the\nconvalescence phase.40-42,level III\nThe presence of NS1 detection after day five may predict severe dengue.44,level II-2\nii. Dengue IgM test\nThe IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the\nmost widely used serological test. The antibody titre is significantly higher\nin primary infections compared to secondary infections. Once the IgM is\ndetectable, it rises quickly and peaks at about two weeks after the onset of\nsymptoms, and it wanes to undetectable levels by 90 days. In primary dengue infection, anti-dengue IgM can be detected after five\ndays of illness in approximately 80% of the cases.37,level II-2 Almost 93%-99%\nof cases will have detectable IgM from day 6 through day 10. In the event\nof a negative IgM result, a repeat serum should be collected after five days.", "chunk_order": 11}

In the event\nof a negative IgM result, a repeat serum should be collected after five days. However, in secondary dengue infections, IgM was detected in among\n78% of patients after day seven.45,level II-2 IgM appears earlier or at the same\ntime frame but usually at lower titres compared to primary dengue. This\nis possibly due to appearance of high levels of anti-dengue IgG before\nor sometimes simultaneously with the IgM response. Thus, 28% of all\nsecondary dengue infections were undiagnosed when only IgM was the\nonly assay performed. 46-48,level III\niii. Dengue IgG test\nIn primary and secondary dengue infection, dengue IgG was detected in\n100% of patients after day seven of onset of fever. Therefore, a repeat\ndengue IgG is recommended if dengue IgM is still negative after day seven\nwith the negative IgG in the initial test sample. 45,level II-2; 47, level III\niv. Differentiation between primary and secondary dengue infection\nDetection of significant elevation of IgG antibodies to dengue virus by\nELISA is very useful for identification of secondary dengue infections. 49-50,level II-2 There are commercially available ELISA kits which can be used\nto differentiate between primary and secondary dengue infections as the\nkits have incorporated in-house threshold levels of IgG. For example,\nPanbio has incorporated a cut off of more than 22 Panbio Units which is\nequivalent to HAI level of 1:2560, and thus indicative of secondary dengue\ninfections.51\nNote: False positive dengue serology\nSerological tests for dengue have been shown to cross-react with:\nother flavivirus \u2013 Japanese Encephalitis\n\u2022\n48,level III; 52, level III\nnon-flavivirus \u2013 malaria, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis\n\u2022\n53-54, level III\nconnective tissue diseases \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis\n\u2022\n55, level III\n5.2.3 Dengue Viral RNA Detection (Real time RT-PCR)\nDengue viral RNA detection is a molecular method that utilises reagents\nthat will target specific genome of the virus to enable amplification and\ndetection of the target. The method is useful only during the viraemic stage\nof the disease and can detect the viral RNA target up to five days after\nonset of the symptoms. 56-57,level II-2 The test is useful for determination of\ncirculating dengue serotypes in the country. Limitations of RT-PCR are:\nThis test is only available in a few centres with facilities and trained\npersonnel (e.g.IMR, National Public Health Laboratory, State Public\nHealth Laboratories and University Malaya Medical Centre).

Please refer to Appendix 4 on details of sample collection for diagnostic tests. As clinical diagnosis of dengue lacks specificity, a definitive diagnosis of\ndengue infections requires laboratory confirmation. There are many targets\nfor laboratory confirmation of dengue which have been listed in Appendix 5\nwith information on sensitivity and specificity of each target and when to do\nafter the onset of symptoms. a)\nb)\nc)\nAppendix 6 summarises the type of tests recommended for patients\npresented with clinical history and their interpretation. This serves as\nlaboratory guidelines for the clinicians who are managing dengue patients. Recommendation 3\nA repeat dengue serology should be obtained at the time of dengue\n\u2022\ndeath. Suitable specimens for viral isolation and/or real time reverse\n\u2022\ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen detection should be done for\nconfirmation of dengue infection. Dengue IgM is usually positive after day 5-7 of illness. Therefore a\n\u2022\nnegative IgM taken before day 5-7 of illness does not exclude dengue\ninfection. Caution: Massive blood transfusion may affect the test results mentioned above. 6. INVESTIGATION OF POST MORTEM CASE\nSuitable samples for virus isolation and PCR can be obtained from most of\nthe organs however, the best tissue sample for investigation is\nthe liver.58-59,level III If patient had encephalitis, CSF should also be included\nas samples for investigation. The liver should be placed in sterile containers\nand moistened with viral transport media or sterile normal saline. CSF\nshould be submitted in sterile bijou bottle. Both should be refrigerated if\nthere is delay in transportation. Specimen for viral investigation should be\ntransported in ice to IMR and National Public Health Laboratory. Recommendation 2\nDengue rapid combo test or non-structural protein 1 antigen (NS1 Ag)\n\u2022\nshould be taken as soon as dengue infection is suspected. If dengue IgM is negative before day seven, a repeat sample must be\n\u2022\ntaken in recovery phase. If dengue IgM is still negative after day seven, dengue IgG should be\n\u2022\ndone for diagnostic confirmation of secondary dengue infection. 7.

MANAGEMENT OF DENGUE INFECTION\n7.1 OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT\nThe management of dengue infection is symptomatic and supportive. An\napproach to outpatient evaluation is as suggested in Table 2. Management issues vary according to the three phases of the clinical\ncourse (refer to section 7.4). It is crucial to recognise plasma leakage, early\nshock and severe organ dysfunction. This can be achieved by frequent\nclinical and laboratory monitoring during the early febrile phase of dengue\ninfection. Dengue patients who are managed in the outpatient setting should be\nprovided with an outpatient dengue monitoring record (refer to Appendix 7)\nto ensure that relevant informations are available for continuity of care by\nhealth care providers. Primary care providers with no immediate haematocrit facilities and/or\n\u2022\npoint of care tests should refer patient to the nearest health facility for\nfurther management. Point of care tests (RCT or NS1 antigen) should be done when dengue\n\u2022\ninfection is suspected.

IV fluid therapy should also be considered in patients who are vomiting,\nsevere diarrhoea and not tolerating orally.60,level III; 66,level III\nThe normal maintenance requirement for IV fluid therapy in such patients\ncould be calculated based on the formula in Table 7. Frequent adjustment\nof maintenance fluid regime is needed during the critical phase. In dengue\npatients without co-morbidities who can tolerate orally, adequate oral fluid\nintake of two to three litres daily should be encouraged (often 1.2-1.5 times\nthe normal maintenance will be required during the critical phase). Patients\nmay be able to take oral fluids after a few hours of IV therapy. If the fluid\ninfusion rate exceeds more than the maintenance requirement, the infusion\nrate should be reviewed within 2-4 hours. In patients with persistent warning signs with increasing or persistently high\nHCT, the graded fluid bolus may be initiated with caution (refer to Table 8). Frequent monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters must be carried\nout every 2-4 hours until patients improve. Aim for urine output of 0.5-1.0\nml/kg/hr. A rising HCT indicates on-going plasma leakage and will require an\nincrease in the IV fluid infusion rate. If patients deteriorate and progress to\nshock, refer to the section on fluid resuscitation in DSS (subchapter 7.5.2). Reduce or consider discontinuation of IV fluid therapy when patients begin\nto show signs of recovery (usually after 24-48 hours of defervescence, or\nthe HCT drops in a stable patient).

CAUTION :\nRecommendation 5\nIn dengue patients without co-morbidities who can tolerate orally,\n\u2022\nadequate oral fluid intake of two to three litres daily should be\nencouraged. These patients may not require intravenous (IV) fluid\ntherapy. IV fluid should be instituted in dengue patients with:\n\u2022\no vomiting, unable to tolerate oral fluids or severe diarrhoea\no increasing haematocrit (with other signs of ongoing plasma\nleakage) despite increased oral intake\nIn patients with persistent warning signs with increasing or persistently\n\u2022\nhigh HCT, the graded fluid bolus may be initiated with caution. Crystalloids solution should be the fluid of choice for non-shock dengue\n\u2022\npatients. 7.5.2 Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)\nDengue shock syndrome is a medical emergency. Recognition of shock\nin its early stage (compensated shock) and prompt fluid resuscitation will\ngive a good clinical outcome.67,level I Refer to Table 1 for details. However,\nfailure to recognise the phase of compensated shock will ultimately lead\nto decompensated (hypotensive) shock with a more complicated disease\ncourse and organ failures. Pulse pressure of <20 mmHg and systolic pressure <90 mmHg are late\nsigns of shock in adults. All patients with dengue shock should be managed in high dependency\nor intensive care units. Fluid resuscitation must be initiated promptly\nand should not be delayed while waiting for admission to ICU or high\ndependency unit. Following initial resuscitation there maybe recurrent\nepisodes of shock because capillary leakage can continue for 24-48 hours. IV fluid therapy is the mainstay of treatment for dengue shock. To date,\nonly four randomised controlled trials studying different types of fluid\nregime in DSS in children aged from 5-15 years are available.67-70,level I Our\nrecommendations are extrapolated from these studies.

Colloids seem to restore the cardiac index and reduce the level of HCT\nfaster than crystalloids in patients with intractable shock.68-69,level I The choice\nof colloids in these studies included gelatin solution and hydroxyethyl starch\n(HES) solution. In the recent meta-analysis, HES in non-dengue critically ill\npatients with sepsis was associated with an increase in the rate of renal\nreplacement therapy and coagulation abnormalities.72,level I\nColloid should be used mainly for resuscitation. Prolonged use of colloid as\nsole maintenance fluid should be avoided. HES solution is contraindicated\nin patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, fluid overload (e.g. pulmonary\noedema and congestive cardiac failure), renal failure and patients receiving\ndialysis. Albumin as resuscitation fluid in DSS has not been studied, however from\nextensive use in critically ill patients, 4%-5% albumin is comparable to\ncrystalloid and may be better in subgroup of septic patients.70,level I;72,level I\nHypertonic sodium lactate in DSS has shown positive results in only one\nstudy.73,level I However, there is lack of clear evidence to support the use of\nthis solution and furthermore, the product is not available in this country. 7.5.3 Principles for Fluid Resuscitation\nThe volume of initial and subsequent fluid resuscitation depends on the\ndegree of shock and can vary from 10-20 ml/kg adjusted body weight. The volume and rate of fluid replacement should be carefully titrated to the\nclinical response to maintain an effective circulation while avoiding an overreplacement. Adequate and effective fluid resuscitation will leads to improvement in the\nfollowing parameters in Table 9. Table 9 : Fluid Responsiveness Parameters\nA.

Thus,\ncompensated metabolic acidosis is an early sign of shock due to leakage\nor bleeding. Lactic acidosis due to tissue hypoxia and hypoperfusion is the\nmost common cause of metabolic acidosis in dengue shock. Monitoring of blood lactate levels is commonly carried out in patients\nwith severe dengue. A lactate level of <2 mmol/L in a critically ill patient\ngenerally implies that the patient has adequate tissue perfusion, although\nhigher levels are not necessarily the result of tissue hypoxia. Correction of shock and adequate fluid replacement will correct the\nmetabolic acidosis. If metabolic acidosis remains uncorrected by this\nstrategy, one should suspect severe bleeding, liver failure, acute kidney\ninjury, sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, drugs (e.g. beta2 agonists, metformin)\nand hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. Hyperchloraemia, caused by the administration of large volumes of 0.9%\nsodium chloride solution (chloride concentration of 154 mmol/L), may cause\nmetabolic acidosis with normal lactate levels and present as a normal\nanion gap metabolic acidosis. If serum chloride levels increase, change the\nfluid to balanced solution such as sterofundin or Hartmann\u2019s.73, level III This\nimproves chloride-related acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis caused by tissue hypoxia is not\nrecommended for pH >7.10. Bicarbonate therapy is associated with sodium\nand fluid overload, an increase in lactate and pCO2 and a decrease in\nserum ionised calcium. A delay in lactate clearance or persistent lactate elevation is associated\nwith poor outcome. Persistent lactic acidosis contributes to myocardial\ndepression, arrhythmias, vasodilatation, increase in respiratory muscle\nworkload, reduced oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production and multiorgan failure.

Clinical Features and Biochemical Profiles\nClinical features suggesting dengue-related hepatic involvement includes\nabdominal pain (18%-63%), nausea and vomiting (49%-58%), anorexia,\nhepatomegaly and elevated transaminases.104-106,level II-2;107,level III In a singlecentered study done in Malaysia, 5.2% of acute liver failure was attributed to\ndengue infection.108,level II-2;109,level III\nRaised AST has been seen in 63%-97% of patients while raised ALT levels in\n45%-96%. More than 10-fold rise has been seen in 3%-15% cases.106,level II-2;110,level III\nIn a majority of studies elevation of AST is more than ALT during the first week of\ninfection, with a tendency to decrease to normal levels within three weeks.104-106,level II-2\nii. Pathogenesis\nThe pathogenesis of liver involvement during dengue infection is poorly\nunderstood. The potential mechanism of liver injury include direct effects of\nthe virus, immunology injury due to dysregulated immune response to the\nvirus, ishaemic injury due to hypotensive episodes and hepatotoxic effect\nof medications such as acetaminophen or herbal remedies.105,level II-2; 109,level III\nHepatocyte injury including necrotic changes commonly involve midzonal\narea followed by centrilobular area.105,level II-2\niii. Management and Use of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\nDengue hepatitis is usually a self-limiting disease. The management of\nacute liver failure (as defined by coagulopathy, usually INR >1.5 and any\ndegree of mental alteration in a patient without preexisting cirrhosis) includes\nappropriate fluid management, monitoring of haemodynamic and metabolic\nparameters.111 Avoidance of other potential hepatotoxic drugs is crucial.

Cardiac complications of dengue should be suspected in those with fluid\nrefractory shock or haemodynamic compromise disproportionate to capillary\nleakage/HCT increase (refer to Algorithm C). In such patients, it is\nrecommended to do ECG, cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography. i.

Dengue Encephalopathy\nThis is the most commonly reported neurological complication in dengue\ninfection. Encephalopathy in dengue infection may be the result of prolonged\nshock, hypoxia, cerebral oedema, acute liver failure, acute renal failure,\nhyponatraemia and cerebral haemorrhage. ii. Dengue Encephalitis\nDengue encephalitis is the next commonly reported neurological complication\nespecially in secondary dengue infection. It classically presents with fever,\nheadache, seizures, altered consciousness and focal neurological signs\nafter 5-7 days of onset of fever.131-133,level II-2 The most common abnormality\non neuroimaging is cerebral oedema. MRI is the imaging modality of choice. However, the MRI can be normal.127,level II-2\nIf possible, lumbar puncture should be done. The CSF should be analysed\nfor dengue virus-specific IgM antibodies, NS1 antigen, dengue virus RNA,\ndepending on available laboratory facilities. CSF analysis can be normal or\nthey can reveal pleocytosis and high protein.133,level II-2;134,level III In general, the\nsensitivity of serological techniques and RT-PCR is was low.134,level III\nThe treatment modality for management of dengue encephalitis is supportive. Symptoms suggestive of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) which include\nheadache, vomiting and reduced consciousness should be looked for. Standard interventions for the management of raised ICP should then be\ninstituted. The outcome of dengue encephalitis is variable with many studies\nshowing good recovery.133,level II-2;135,level II-2\niii. Acute Transverse Myelitis\nAcute transverse myelitis in dengue infection can occur within the first week\nof illness due to direct virus invasion or 1-2 weeks later as an immunemediated phenomenon. iv.

Transient proteinuria and haematuria have been reported.136-137,level III and\nusually normalise within 3-4 weeks of illness. Acute renal failure (ARF) occasionally complicates severe dengue\ninfection.

Indications for intensive care\nreferral can be categorised into organ systems as in Table 11.

Initiation of positive pressure ventilation will further decrease the\ncardiac output by reducing venous return. In patients with pleural effusion\nand ascites, haemodynamics will be further compromised when higher\nairway pressure is applied to achieve adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Care must be taken to avoid trauma to the airway during intubation, which\nmay cause bleeding. In patients with metabolic acidosis, respiratory support should be\nconsidered despite preservation of relatively normal arterial blood pH. When the actual PaCO2 is higher than the expected to compensate for the\nacidosis, consider intubation and mechanical ventilation. Formula to calculate expected PaCO2 = 1.5 (Actual [HCO3] mmol/L ) + 8 (+ 2 mmHg)\nWhen a patient with metabolic acidosis is on invasive mechanical\nventilation, set the ventilator settings so that the PaCO2 remains low, at\nthe expected PaCO2 level. Failure to do so may cause further deterioration\nas the acidosis markedly worsens, resulting in depression of myocardial\ncontractility, hypotension and arrhythmias. 7.7.2 Haemodynamic Support\nFluid resuscitation is crucial and should be initiated early as per guidelines\nin the section on fluid management. The causes of persistent shock and\ntreatment in severe dengue are outlined in Algorithm C. The role of inotropic and vasopressor agents in dengue shock has not\nbeen investigated in clinical trials. Vasopressors may be able to maintain\nthe blood pressure but do not improve tissue perfusion if the intravascular\nvolume has not been restored. The use of inotropic and vasopressor agents should be limited to the\nfollowing clinical situations (refer to Algorithm C):\nAs\na\ntemporary\nmeasure\nto\nprevent\nlife-threatening\nhypotension while aggressive fluid resuscitation is being carried\nout or during induction for intubation.165-168,level I\nCardiogenic shock\nIn the case of cardiac dysfunction, it is appropriate to use inotropic\nagents such as dobutamine or adrenaline in combination with a\nvasopressor.169,level I\nConcomitant septic shock\nNoradrenaline is preferred to other vasopressors as first-line\ntherapy.165,level I\nIndications for mechanical ventilation in severe dengue include:\npersistent shock\n\u2022\nacute respiratory failure secondary to massive pleural effusion\n\u2022\n+\nascites, fluid overload\nsevere metabolic acidosis\n\u2022\nairway protection\n\u2022\n1. 2. 3.", "chunk_order": 32}

Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Insertion\nIn any condition that requires fluid resuscitation, rapid and large volume of\nfluids can be infused via a large bore peripheral venous catheter. A well-\nsited proximal peripheral venous catheter is sufficient if it is expected that\nvasopressor is required for only short duration (1-2 hours).170\nThe commonly available CVCs are long and multi-lumens with relatively\nsmaller individual lumen.

In general, it is a relative contraindication to insert a CVC in patients with\nthrombocytopaenia or coagulation abnormalities. Overall, the risk of\nbleeding following CVC insertion in these patients is low.174-175,level II-2; 176,level III\nA subclavian approach should be avoided as the subclavian artery and vein\nis not accessible to direct compression.176,level III The use of real-time USG\nis recommended for CVC insertion if it is available and there is expertise. 177,level I;178, level II-2\nRoutine prophylactic transfusion of platelets and FFP in severe\nthrombocytopaenia prior to insertion of CVC should not be done as there is\nno clear evidence to support this practice.179-180;181,level III If platelets are to be\ntransfused, a CVC should be done within 4 hours following transfusion for\na maximum effect.182,level II-2 The most recent recommendation by American\nAssociation of Blood Banks suggested for transfusion as low as 20,000\nprior to CVC insertion.179\nii.

Pregnancy Outcomes in Pregnant Women with Dengue Infection\nSignificant bleeding due to thrombocytopaenia is not common. However,\nboth mother and the newborn with dengue infection may be at an increased\nrisk for haemorrhage in the presence of DSS. The higher percentage of\nsevere dengue infection occurred among pregnant women compared to\nnon-pregnant women (OR: 3.38; 95% CI: 2.10\u20135.42, p=0.0001).187,level II-3\nSignificant number of pregnant women with dengue infection may present\nwith DSS and mortality rate is about three times higher in this group.187-189,\nlevel II-3 A rare complication with pre-eclampsia, eclampsia or dengue\nencephalopathy have been reported.189,level II-3\nA very close monitoring of the vital signs, early signs of shock and bleeding\nshould be sought.

FOOD AND SUPPLEMENTS\nFood and supplements such as Carica papaya leave juice/extract, cactus\nextract, crab or padi frog soup, bitter gourd soup, porcupine bezoar stone,\nTawa-tawa and Pegaga leaves and commercial isotonic drink have not\nbeen proven scientifically with robust evidence in preventing complications,\nexpediting the recovery or curing dengue infection. It is important to note\nthat the main problem that needs to be dealt with in dengue infection is\nthe plasma leakage and/or immune activation issues, not only about the\nlow platelet count. Manipulation of platelet count alone does not alter the\nclinical course of the disease as it is just a surrogate marker of disease\nprogression or evolution. Plasma leakage and organ dysfunction should be\nthe main focus of management. 10.

This\naims to prevent mortality and long-term morbidity. 13.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:-\nwide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies\ni. and softcopies)\nregular dengue update for healthcare providers\nii. Existing barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG are:-\ninadequate understanding of dengue infection and management\ni. among patients/carers and healthcare providers\ninsufficient resources especially trained personnel, diagnostic kits and\nii. infrastructure\nvariation in treatment practice and preferences\niii. 13.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:-\nensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare providers\ni. initiate training (with adequate funding) of healthcare providers\nii. ensuring information is up-to-date\nensure availability of highly specialised diagnostic tools and trained\niii. manpower in dengue management including multidisciplinary team at\ndifferent levels of healthcare\nensure widespread distribution of updated patient education materials\niv. Implementation strategies such as Quick Reference and Training Module\nwill be developed following the approval of the CPG by MoH. To assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following is proposed as\nclinical audit indicator for quality management:-\nREFERENCES\nWorld Health Organization.

APPENDIX 7\nOUTPATIENT DENGUE MONITORING RECORD\nAPPENDIX 8\nDENGUE ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST\nAPPENDIX 9\nHOME CARE ADVICE LEAFLET FOR DENGUE PATIENTS\nWHAT SHOULD BE DONE? Adequate bed rest\n\u2022\nAdequate fluid intake (more than 8 glasses or 2 litres for an average\n\u2022\nperson). Milk, fruit juice (caution with diabetes patient) and isotonic\n--\nelectrolyte solution (ORS) and barley water. Plain water alone is not sufficient and may cause electrolyte\n--\nimbalance. Take paracetamol (not more than 4 gram per day). \u2022\nTepid sponging. \u2022\nIf possible, use mosquito repellent or rest under a mosquito net even\n\u2022\nduring day time to prevent mosquito bites.
