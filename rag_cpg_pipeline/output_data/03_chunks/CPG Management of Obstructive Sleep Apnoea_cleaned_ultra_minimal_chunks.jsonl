The guideline should not override the responsibility of the\npractitioners to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the\nindividual patient. This should be done in consultation with the patients\nand their families or guardians, taking into account the management\noptions available locally. Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThis guideline was approved in 2022 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2026) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When it\nis due for updating, the Chairperson of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNOEA (OSA) IN ADULTS\nScreening\n\u2022 STOP-BANG* Questionnaire should be used for screening of adults\nwith clinical suspicion of OSA. \u2022 Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) may be used to assess daytime\nsleepiness. * STOP - Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnoea and high blood\nPressure\nBANG - BMI, Age, Neck circumference and Gender\nDiagnosis\n\u2022 OSA should be diagnosed using polysomnography (PSG) either\nlevel 1, 2 or 3. \u2022 In patient with suspected OSA, the PSG should be performed within\nsix month of initial consultation. \uf0a1 Scoring of PSG should be performed by trained medical personnel\nand its interpretation should be verified by trained specialists. Treatment\n\u2022 Lifestyle intervention for weight reduction should be advocated in\nOSA. \u2022 Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy should be offered to patients\nwith OSA upon diagnosis especially in moderate to severe OSA. \uf0a1 Nasal mask is the preferred interface. \u2022 Upper airway surgery may be considered in selected group of OSA\npatients. \uf0a1 A follow-up PSG may be considered three months after surgery. \u2022 Maxillomandibular advancement may be considered in certain\npatients with moderate to severe OSA. \u2022 Mandibular advancement appliance may be considered for adult\npatients with OSA. \uf0a1 The preferred design should be tailored to the patient\u2019s condition. \u2022 In obese OSA patients (body mass index \u226535 kg/m2), bariatric\nsurgery may be considered.", "chunk_order": 2}

Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\niii\nGeneral Principles of Perioperative Management of Suspected\nand Confirmed OSA\n\u2022 Patients who are at risk of OSA should be screened for OSA\npreoperatively. \uf0a1 The preferred screening tool is STOP-BANG. \u2022 Patient with or suspected high risk of OSA should be monitored\nclosely postoperative. \u2022 Hospitals should have suitable positive airway pressure devices\navailable for perioperative use or ensure patients with OSA bring\ntheir own device to the hospital. Referral\n\u2022 Patients with clinical suspicion of OSA with or without cardiometabolic risk factors and STOP-BANG score \u22653 should be referred\nfor diagnostic sleep test. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNOEA IN CHILDREN\nDiagnosis\n\u2022 Paediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) should be used as a screening\ntool for OSA in children. \u2022 PSG level 1 should be considered for diagnosis of OSA in this group\nespecially those at risk. \uf0a1 If it is not available, overnight pulse oximetry may be used as an\nalternative diagnostic tool. Treatment\n\u2022 Oral montelukast and/or nasal corticosteroids may be considered in\nchildren with OSA. \u2022 Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is the treatment of choice in children with\nOSA due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. \uf0a1 In those with post-AT residual disease, upper airway and multilevel\nobstruction should be reassessed and manage accordingly. \u2022 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be offered to\nchildren with OSA if they have persistent symptoms or signs after\nsurgery or in whom surgery is contraindicated. \uf0a1 Nasal CPAP is the preferred option\n\uf0a1 CPAP should be managed by experienced and skilled\nmultidisciplinary clinicians\nManagement of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\nMonitoring and Follow-up\n\u2022 Children with OSA especially the high-risk group should be followedup by multidisciplinary team trained in sleep medicine. \u2022 Children with OSA who require long-term use of CPAP should be\nmonitored objectively by respiratory paediatrician with paediatric\nsleep experience. \u2022 Monitoring of CPAP therapy complications is required during followup. SPECIAL GROUP\n\u2022 Pregnant women with suspected OSA based on symptoms and signs\nshould be referred for further management by a multidisciplinary\nspecialist team. \u2022 Patients with OSA and craniofacial anomalies should be assessed\nfor the benefit and risk of a surgical intervention. \u2022 Patients with Down syndrome should be screened for OSA and\ntreated accordingly. \u2022 CPAP is the preferred initial treatment in stable ambulatory patients\nwith obesity hypoventilation syndrome and severe OSA.

Guidelines Development\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this CPG were from\nthe Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Higher Education and private\nsector. There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review\nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane\nDatabase of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines\nInternational Network. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy. The inclusion criterion was patients suspected and diagnosed\nwith OSA. The exclusion criteria were complex sleep apnoea syndrome\n(e.g. overlap syndrome etc.) and other sleep disorders e.g. narcolepsy,\ninsomnia etc. The search was limited to literature published in the last\n10 years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of\nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in the\nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom November 2020 to 31 May 2022. The literature search was\nrepeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development\nprocess allowing any relevant papers published before 31 May 2022\nto be included.

INTRODUCTION\nObstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep-related breathing\ndisorder caused by repetitive upper airway collapse resulting in partial\nor complete breathing cessation. Symptoms include unrefreshed sleep,\ndaytime sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, awakening with a gasping\nor choking sensation and loud snoring. Sleep disordered breathing\n(SDB) and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) are commonly\ndescribed as OSA in the literature. For the purpose of this document,\nwe will use OSA as the referring terminology. This disease affects both children and adults and is associated with\nsignificant morbidity. A recent review estimated that nearly one billion\nadults aged 30 - 69 years worldwide could have OSA. The number\nof people with moderate to severe OSA in whom treatment was\nhighly recommended was estimated to be at least 425 million.1, level III\nIn children, the prevalence of OSA was reported to be up to 5.7%. Obesity was identified as an independent risk factor for OSA in this\ngroup.2, level I Early recognition and treatment are essential in preventing\nsequelae from OSA. This medical condition increases all cause and\ncardiovascular (CV)-related mortality predominantly among the middleaged group. It is also associated with other co-morbidities including\nmetabolic and cognitive consequences. Therefore, it is important to be\naware of the disease and updated with its management. The management of OSA has evolved since its discovery in 1965,\nespecially after the introduction of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure\n(CPAP) therapy via nasal mask in 1981 as a form of treatment for OSA. To date, there is no specific local CPG addressing the management\nof OSA. Thus, it is timely to have the first Malaysian CPG on OSA to\nguide local healthcare providers in managing this common disorder. It\nwill provide a standard framework for the management of OSA based\non the latest evidence available. Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\n2. EPIDEMIOLOGY, RISK FACTORS AND CO-MORBIDITIES\n2.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors\nThe prevalence of OSA varies due to differences in the definition,\ndiagnostic methods and sociodemographic features. Using American\nAcademy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2012 diagnostic criteria, a\nsystematic review estimated that globally 936 million adults aged\n30 - 69 years had OSA, in which 45% had moderate to severe\ndisease.1, level III In another systematic review, the overall prevalence of\nOSA ranged from 9% to 38% in adults. Evidence showed that advancing\nage, male gender and higher body mass index (BMI) increased the\nprevalence.3, level III However, there are no recent local published studies\non the prevalence of OSA. The established risk factors for OSA include:4\n\u2022 age (40 to 70 years old)\n\u2022 male gender\n\u2022 family history of OSA\n\u2022 morbid obesity\nCraniofacial features are a risk factor for OSA.", "chunk_order": 10}

Screening tools are useful to detect patients at risk for OSA. Early\ndetection will lead to early referral and also prioritisation of patients who\nmay need a diagnostic tool e.g. an overnight polysomnography (PSG)\nto confirm the diagnosis. Several screening tools have been widely used in the adult population\ne.g. the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) (Appendix 5), STOP-BANG\nQuestionnaire (SBQ) (refer to Appendix 6 and 7), STOP Questionnaire\n(SQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (Appendix 8). A meta-analysis found that the sensitivity and diagnostic odds ratio\n(DOR) of the SBQ were higher than those of the BQ, SQ and ESS in\ndetecting mild, moderate and severe OSA. However, the specificity of\nSBQ was lower compared with ESS. Hence the study concluded that\nthe SBQ was superior in the detection of various severity of OSA in\nadults compared with the others.

The diagnosis of OSA cannot be made solely based on clinical signs\nor symptoms identified during sleep-oriented history and physical\nexamination. They need to be supported by PSG or home sleep apnea\ntesting (HSAT).22\nManagement of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\n7\nOSA is diagnosed through PSG. There are four levels of sleep test\nas described in Table 2. Only level 1 - 3 can be used for diagnostic\npurposes, whilst level 4 is used for screening. Table 2. Different level of sleep testing\nAdapted: Hesselbacher SE, Mattewal A, Hirshkowitz M et al. Classification, Technical\nSpecifications, and Types of Home Sleep Testing Devices for SleepDisordered Breathing. Sleep Med. Clin. 6 (2011):261-282. In the standard PSG, Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is defined as\napnea+hypopnea/total sleep time while the AHI in the portable monitor\n(PM) is the number of apneas+hypopneas/total recording time. As a\nresult, PM are likely to underestimate the severity of respiratory events\ncompared with PSG. The other disadvantages of PM include its inability to evaluate the\nquality of sleep and other non-respiratory sleep disorders. HSAT and\nPM have the advantage that the patient sleeps in his/her own bed, thus\nthe sleep pattern may be more representative of everyday sleep. PM\nreduces health-care costs and waiting times, thus making the diagnosis\nof OSA accessible to centres that do not have conventional PSG.

Fiber-optic nasal endoscopy with Muller\u2019s\nManoeuver (FNMM) has been used as a method to assess upper airway\nobstruction. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) has recently been\nintroduced for such assessment. However, it requires deep sedation\nand involvement of anaesthetists, and thus may pose challenges in\ncarrying out the procedure in the local setting.

Surgical treatment for OSA is one of the treatment options in selected\ngroup of patients. Surgery is part of continuous care for OSA patients\nwho do not tolerate or accept PAP therapy.49 It is also indicated to\nincrease PAP compliance in patients with major structural upper airway\nobstruction.

Surgical success in OSA is defined as postoperative\nreduction in the AHI of 50% and/or a postoperative AHI of <20 event/\nhour54, level II-3 whilst surgical cure is defined as an AHI of <5 events/hour\nafter any sleep surgery. The CPG DG opines that follow-up PSG should be performed three\nmonths after surgery for reassessment. i. Nasal surgery\nNasal breathing is vital for better quality sleep. A non-randomised\nclinical trial showed that combining nose surgery in multilevel surgery\nimproved surgical success compared with multilevel surgery without\nnose surgery in OSA (OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.7).50, level II-1\nEvidence from an earlier meta-analysis with moderate quality of\nprimary papers showed that isolated nasal surgery in patients\nwith OSA and nasal obstruction reduced therapeutic CPAP device\npressures compared with baseline (MD= -2.66 cmH2O, 95% CI -3.65 to\n-1.67).51, level II-3\nUpper airway surgery may have a moderate effect on decreasing\ntherapeutic PAP requirements (i.e. optimal PAP level) and increasing\nPAP adherence although this estimate is based on a small number of\nuncontrolled observational studies.49\nii. Oropharyngeal and velopharyngeal surgery\nThere are various surgical techniques to address obstruction at\nvelopharyngeal region.

Adjunctive Therapy\ni. Mandibular advancement appliance\nMandibular advancement appliance (MAA) is a relatively non-invasive\nintra-oral device which is worn overnight to position the mandible\nin a forward and downward direction. In principle, by repositioning\nthe mandible forward, the total airway volume during mandibular\nadvancement increases, predominantly at the lateral dimensions, in the\nvolume of the velopharynx, and to a lesser extent in the volume of the\nhypopharynx. The mechanics of airway volume increase is achieved\nthrough an increase in the lower anterior facial height, reduction\nin the distance between the hyoid and posterior nasal spine, lateral\ndisplacement of the parapharyngel fat pads away from the airway and\nanterior movement of the tongue base muscles.

A systematic review on children and adolescents (<16 years old) with\nmild to moderate OSA who require orthodontic correction for their\nmalocclusion (e.g. mandibular retrognathia, deep bite and crossbite)\nshowed limited evidence to suggest that functional appliance result\nin short-term (6 - 12 months) improvement in AHI scores. The AHI\nreductions were significant with:118, level I\n\u2022 full time wear of the twin block functional appliances\n\u2022 part time wear of modified monoblocs\n\u2022 full time wear of a customised mandibular repositioning oral\nappliance\nHowever, the quality of the primary papers was low. In a Cochrane systematic review oral or functional appliances showed\nbetter reduction in AHI with RR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.76) compared\nwith no treatment in children with OSA.

In a practice guideline for the perioperative management of patients\nwith OSA, the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force\nrecommends to consider the use of local peripheral nerve blocks and\ncentral neuroaxial anaesthesia when indicated. Patients who are at an\nincreased perioperative risk from OSA should not be discharged to an\nunmonitored setting following recovery from anaesthesia until they are\nno longer at risk of post operative respiratory complications.122\nDexmedetomidine is associated with an overall perioperative opioidsparing effect in paediatric patients undergoing AT with a significant\nreduction in perioperative opioid use.123, level III\nRecommendation 18\n\u2022 Perioperative assessment should be thoroughly performed in the\npaediatric group at high risk and those diagnosed with obstructive\nsleep apnoea (OSA). \u2022 Paediatric patients at an increased perioperative risk from OSA\nshould be closely monitored following recovery from anaesthesia. Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\n4.6 Monitoring and Follow-up\nAll paediatric OSA should be monitored and followed-up between six\nweeks to 12 months after each treatment intervention. The parameters\nto be assessed during follow-up include symptoms, severity of OSA\nevaluated objectively, complications from the cardiovascular and central\nnervous system, quality of life, enuresis and paediatric growth rate. PSG is the preferred objective method to detect residual OSA after a\ntreatment intervention. However, in settings where PSG is not available,\nalternative methods e.g. polygraphy, oximetry and capnography can be\nconsidered for use.99\nAASM guidelines recommend that all OSA patients with persistent\nsigns and symptoms after therapy should be reassessed to determine\nwhether further treatment is required.124, level III\nERS Task Force further describes the criteria and interval of\nreassessment of children with OSA:99\n\u2022 persistent SDB symptoms or at risk of persistent OSA preoperatively \u22656 weeks after AT\n\u2022 mild OSA treated with montelukast/nasal corticosteroids after 12\nweeks of treatment\n\u2022 post-RME at 12 months or earlier if symptoms persist\nThe ERS Task Force also recommends repeat titration of PAP therapy\nat least annually or earlier if there is a clinical indication.99\nOn follow-up, adherence to PAP therapy is measured objectively within\nthree months of treatment initiation.

Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\n5. SPECIAL GROUP\n5.1 Pregnancy\nOSA is common in pregnancy and associated with various pregnancyrelated health outcomes. A meta-analysis showed that the worldwide\nprevalence of OSA among pregnant women was 15% (95% CI 12 to\n18). The estimated prevalence for each trimester ranged from 15 - 19%. OSA was linked to a higher risk of pregnancy induced hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, pulmonary oedema during pregnancy,\nCaesarean-section and postoperative wound complications. The OR\nvalues were 1.97, 2.35, 1.55, 6.35, 1.42, and 1.87 respectively. OSA\nwas also related to an increased risk for preterm birth (OR=1.62) and\nneonatal intensive care unit admission (OR=1.28).127, level II-2\na. Screening and Diagnosis\nPregnant woman with risk factors especially obesity and craniofacial\nanomalies should be asked about symptoms of OSA. The use of\nscreening questionnaires may not be helpful based on the following\nevidence. A meta-analysis showed that performance of screening questionnaires\nfor OSA during pregnancy were poor to fair.128, level III\n\u2022 BQ had pooled sensitivity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.83) and\nspecificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.75)\n\u2022 ESS had pooled sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.56) and\nspecificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.75)\nIn one of the included studies, a large cross-sectional study on pregnant\nwomen in their third trimester showed the overall predictive ability of the\nscreening tools (STOP, STOP-BANG, BQ, ASA Checklist and ESS) for\nOSA was modest with AUC of 0.62 to 0.695. However, none of the\nscreening tools accurately identified OSA among the patients. Diagnosing OSA in a pregnant woman is a challenge for physicians.

Risk of OSA\nChildren with craniofacial anomalies (CA), e.g. Pierre Robin Sequence\n(PRS) with micrognathia, retrognathia, glossoptosis with or without cleft\nlip/palate, have an increased risk of OSA due to upper airway obstruction\nas the tongue is relatively large compared to the mandibular structures\nand tends to prolapse backwards. Airway obstruction in these groups\ncan be severe and results in intermittent hypoxia that may impair longterm cognitive and intellectual development.131, level III\nChildren with midface and mandibular hypoplasia have variable\nseverity of OSA which correlates with the degree of hypoplasia. Almost\n30% of paediatric group with syndromic cleft lip or palate are screened\npositive for OSA. The risk of OSA increases due to changes in the\nupper airway structure which include nasal deformities. OSA is more\nsevere in PRS patients with cleft palate than those with isolated cleft\npalate.132 - 136, level III\nChildren below 18 years old with Class II skeletal pattern, tendency\nfor backward growth rotator137, level I and reduced upper airway sagittal\nwidth are at risk of OSA.138, level II-2\nA meta-analysis on the craniofacial morphological characteristics (refer\nto Figure 1): associated with OSA in non-syndromic paediatric patients\ncompared with controls showed.137, level I\n\u2022 the cephalometric findings i.e. angle between sella, nasion and B\npoint (SNB) and difference between SNA and SNB, where SNA\nis the angle between sella, nasion and A point, while SNB is the\nangle between sella, nasion and B point (ANB) angles, indicated\nmore Class II skeletal pattern:\n\uf0a1 SNB (MD= -1.79o, 95% CI -2.61 to -0.97)\n\uf0a1 ANB (MD = 1.38o, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.92)\n\u2022 the cephalometric finding i.e.", "chunk_order": 43}

The prevalence of OSA in DS varies from 45% to 82%. There are\nmultiple factors to explain the increased prevalence of OSA in DS which\ninclude differences in anatomy and physiology. Soft tissue crowding of\nthe pharynx and palate caused by midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia\nis further exacerbated by an increased incidence of adenotonsillar\nhypertrophy, relative macroglossia and glossoptosis, laryngomalacia,\nand subglottic and tracheal stenosis.

It is a\nchronic disorder associated with several cardio-metabolic complications,\nneurocognitive impairment, increased motor vehicle accidents and\nreduced productivity when untreated. Hence, early diagnosis and\nprompt management of OSA can improve its outcomes. As OSA is the commonest sleep-related breathing disorder, its\nmanagement should be emphasised throughout all levels of care. Therefore, implementation of nation-wide screening among high-risk\ngroup e.g. with STOP-BANG questionnaire is important. Those at high\nrisk should be provided with health education and advice on lifestyle\nmodifications to prevent complications of the disease. Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea\n47\nPSG is the gold standard to accurately diagnose OSA whilst CPAP\nis the mainstay of treatment. However, there is a lack of availability\nof sleep laboratories, as well as a scarcity of sleep specialists and\ntrained sleep technologists in Malaysia.

The purpose of the system is to assess and communicate\na patient\u2019s pre-anesthesia medical co-morbidities. The classification\nsystem alone does not predict the perioperative risks, but used with\nother factors (e.g. type of surgery, frailty, level of deconditioning), it can\nbe helpful in predicting perioperative risks. The definitions and examples shown in the table below are guidelines\nfor the clinician. To improve communication and assessments at a\nspecific institution, anesthesiology departments may choose to develop\ninstitutional-specific examples to supplement the ASA-approved\nexamples. Assigning a Physical Status Classification level is a clinical decision\nbased on multiple factors. While the classification may initially be\ndetermined at various times during the preoperative assessment of\nthe patient, the final assignment of Physical Status Classification is\nmade on the day of anaesthesia care by the anaesthesiologist after\nevaluating the patient.
