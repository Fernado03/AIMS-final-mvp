The guideline should not override the responsibility of the\npractitioners to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the\nindividual patient. This should be done in consultation with the patients\nand their families or guardians, taking into account the management\noptions available locally. Management of Gout (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2021 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2025) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When it\nis due for updating, the Chairperson of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken\nto ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of\npublication.

Risk Factors and Preventive Strategies\n\u2022 To prevent gout:\n\uf0a1 a healthy lifestyle should be advocated, which includes\n- maintenance of a healthy body weight\n- avoidance of alcohol\n- adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n(DASH) diet which\n\uf06e discourages purine-rich red meat, fructose-rich foods, full-fat\ndairy products and saturated fats\n\uf06e encourages vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or lowfat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts and vegetable oil\n\uf0a1 diuretics should be avoided if possible, or replaced by an\nalternative drug when used as an antihypertensive agent\nDiagnosis\n\u2022 Demonstration of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial\nfluid or tophus aspirate under polarised light microscopy should be\nperformed to confirm the diagnosis of gout. \uf0a1 If confirmation of presence of MSU crystals is not possible, the\ndiagnosis may be made based on typical clinical manifestations. \uf0a1 Musculoskeletal ultrasonography may assist in the diagnosis of\ngout with atypical presentations. Treat-To-Target\n\u2022 Treat-to-target strategy aiming for serum urate of <360 \u03bcmol/L should\nbe applied in the treatment of all gout patients. Management of Gout (Second Edition)\niii\nTreatment\n\u2022 Patients with gout should be treated with urate-lowering therapy\nwhen indicated. \uf0a1 Allopurinol is the first-line therapy. It should be started at low dose\nand increased gradually. \uf0a1 When allopurinol is contraindicated or not tolerated, febuxostat or\nuricosuric agents may be considered. \u2022 Gout flare should be treated promptly and adequately.", "chunk_order": 2}

Management of Gout (Second Edition)\nv\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGuidelines Development\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this CPG were from\nthe Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Education and private sector. There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee\n(RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane\nDatabase of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines\nInternational Network. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy. The inclusion criterion was all adults with gout. The search\nwas limited to literature published in the last 13 years, on humans and\nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify\nrelevant studies.", "chunk_order": 3}

In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify\nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 12 November\n2019 to 30 June 2021. Literature search was repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 30 June 2021 to be included. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from\nthe CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other guidelines as listed below:\n\u2022 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guideline for the\nManagement of Gout\n\u2022 2016 updated European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)\nevidence-based recommendations for the management of gout\n\u2022 The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) Guideline for the\nManagement of Gout (2017)\n\u2022 2018 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the\ndiagnosis of gout\n\u2022 2012 ACR Guidelines for Management of Gout. Part 1: Systematic\nNonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Therapeutic Approaches\nto Hyperuricemia\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as references. A total of 13 main clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG\nmembers met 19 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All statements and\nManagement of Gout (Second Edition)\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any differences in opinion\nwere resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely on the\nfindings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, with\nlocal practices taken into consideration. Literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian\nPreventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001) while the\ngrading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE\n(refer to page i). The writing of the CPG follows strictly the requirements\nof AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties.

The disease was also described by Hippocrates\nin the fifth BCE.1 Despite being one of the oldest joint diseases, its\nprevalence and incidence seem to be increasing globally.2 Gout is\nassociated with an increase in all-cause mortality, chronic disability,\nimpairment of health-related quality of life, higher usage of health care\nservices and reduced productivity.3 In many countries, the outcomes\nof the disease are far from favourable due to suboptimal management. Commonly, only a third to half of patients with gout receive uratelowering therapy (ULT) and fewer than a half of them adhere to\ntreatment.2 A study in a rheumatology centre in Malaysia reported that\nonly 34.9% of its patients achieved the recommended serum urate\n(SU) target. Nonadherence was the main reason for failure to attain\nthe target.4\nThe first edition of this CPG was published in 2008 by the Malaysian\nSociety of Rheumatology. Since then, there have been advances in\nthe understanding of the risk factors, diagnostic techniques, treatment\nstrategy and options, and comorbidities of the disease. The employment\nof the treat-to-target (T2T) concept represents an important milestone in\ngout management. By bringing SU to <360 \u00b5mol/L, crystals are dissolved\nand this suggests that gout is potentially a \u2018curable\u2019 disease. However,\nULT which is the cornerstone of therapy needs to be maintained longterm to prevent new crystal formation. The reversibility of the process\nis a unique feature of gout, in contrast with other rheumatic conditions. Nevertheless, if joint destruction has set in, damage is permanent. Of equal significance is the evolving science regarding risk factors\ne.g. obesity and high-fructose corn syrup. Obesity is thought to be\na contributing factor in the rising prevalence and incidence of gout.2\nHigh-fructose corn syrup increases risk of incident gout. On the other\nhand, plant-derived high purine diet does not.5 Non-invasive imaging\nmodalities e.g. ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography\n(DECT) have improved the diagnostic armamentarium of gout. There\nis new development on the use of allopurinol. The recommendation is\nto \u2018start low, go slow\u2019 when initiating and titrating it to achieve target,\nespecially in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The discovery of febuxostat, which is a non-purine xanthine oxidase\ninhibitor (XOI) widens the choice of ULT for prescribers. Combination\ntherapy further expands treatment options. Last but not least, the role\nof education for health care professionals and patients is important too. Without proper knowledge and understanding, all the above progress\nwill not be implemented successfully. Misconceptions and lack of\nknowledge of the disease among both parties are barriers to effective\nmanagement of the disease.6 Therefore an updated version of the CPG\nis timely.

The\nlabel \u2018gout\u2019 should be reserved only for clinically evident disease.7\nGout is a consequence of persistent hyperuricaemia. \u2022 Not all individuals with hyperuricaemia develop MSU crystal\ndeposition8 or gout.9 \u2013 11, level II-2\nAlthough gout is predominantly a musculoskeletal condition with acute\nand chronic arthritis, as well as bursitis, it can also have extra-articular\ninvolvement e.g. chronic nephropathy and urolithiasis.

NATURAL HISTORY\nThe natural history of untreated gout evolves through the following\nphases (refer to Figure 1):\ni. asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (hyperuricaemia without gout)\nii. asymptomatic MSU crystal deposition (MSU crystal deposition\nwithout gout)\niii. recurrent gout flares with intercritical gout\niv. gout with chronic gouty arthritis/tophaceous gout/erosive gout\nIf untreated, gout may progress to a stage with joint damage and tophi. Gout typically presents for the first time with acute monoarthritis (first\ngout flare) of the first MTP joint (podagra), midfoot or ankle, and less\ncommonly with oligoarthritis. The first gout flare is preceded by a period\nof asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and MSU crystal deposition. It is selflimiting and lasts about 1 - 2 weeks. This acute episode is followed by\ncomplete resolution of symptoms and signs of joint inflammation, which\nthen enters a quiet interval called intercritical gout. If hyperuricaemia\npersists, the result is recurrent flares. Their occurrences gradually\nbecome more frequent and prolonged with multiple joint involvement\n(polyarticular gout), including those of the upper limbs. If hyperuricaemia\nremains uncontrolled, chronic gouty arthritis with or without tophi\nformation can ensue later, on an average of 10 years after initial\nsymptom onset. It is important to note that not all individuals with hyperuricaemia\ndevelop asymptomatic MSU crystal deposition or gout. It has yet to\nbe elucidated that asymptomatic MSU crystal deposition will eventually\nlead to gout in all subjects. Figure 1.", "chunk_order": 13}

It\nhas 100% specificity. Polarised light microscopy is the standard method\nfor detecting MSU crystals.

However, the incidence rates of\ngouty arthritis in both groups were low (0.91% and 5.86% for febuxostat\nand placebo respectively).42, level I Therefore, the benefit of starting ULT\nmay not outweigh the potential adverse events (AE) of treatment as the\nvast majority of these patients will not develop gout. b.

DISCONTINUATION OF URATE-LOWERING THERAPY\nA systematic review of five observational studies on discontinuation of\nULT in adults with gout, showed that recurrence of arthritis was high\nranging from 36.4 to 81.0%. The mean time to relapse varied from 15.8\nto 56.0 months with earliest relapses occurring at four months.98, level II-2\nOne of the cohort studies included in the systematic review showed that\nhigher SU levels during ULT treatment (HR=1.57, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.08)\nand at follow-up after ULT discontinuation (HR=2.29, 95% CI 1.91 to\n2.74) were independently associated with gout recurrence. \u2022 ULT should be continued long-term in gout patients to prevent\nrecurrence of gout. Management of Gout (Second Edition)\n14. ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT\nThere are multiple adjunctive treatments that have been used in gout to\naugment the effect of ULT. They are discussed below. \u2022 Vitamin C\nVitamin C has been believed to have urate lowering effect. In a small\nRCT of eight weeks duration, modest dosage of vitamin C 500 mg/day\nwas not clinically significant in its urate lowering effect compared with\nallopurinol in gout.99, level I\n\u2022 Fibrates\nIn a meta-analysis of six RCTs on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nand hyperlipidaemia with mostly normal urate level, fibrate reduced\nplasma urate concentration compared with placebo (WMD= -1.50 mg/\ndL (-90 \u00b5mol/L), 95% CI -2.38 to -0.63). Subgroup analysis showed\nthat fenofibrate was effective but not bezafibrate.100, level I The included\nprimary papers were of moderate quality.

Management of Gout (Second Edition)\n17. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nManagement of gout should be guided by the latest evidence and\navailability of local resources to provide quality care to patients. Several\nfactors may affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 17.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 availability of CPG to health care providers (hard copies and soft\ncopies/online)\n\u2022 regular seminar/conference/course for health care providers\non management of gout including those involving professional\nbodies (e.g. Malaysian Society of Rheumatology)\n\u2022 public awareness activities during World Arthritis Day\n\u2022 involvement of governmental/non-governmental organisations\ne.g. Malaysian Society of Rheumatology and Arthritis Foundation\nof Malaysia\n\u2022 accessibility to relevant multidisciplinary teams\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n\u2022 limited awareness and understanding/knowledge in management\nof gout among health care providers\n\u2022 variation in clinical management and preferences\n\u2022 insufficient resources in terms of budget, expertise, access to\ndiagnostic tests and medications (gout placed at low priority by\nstakeholders)\n\u2022 misconception about the disease and its management by the\npublic\n\u2022 no national registry on gout\n17.2 Potential Resource Implications\nT2T strategy is an important concept in gout management. However,\nmany clinicians especially those in the primary care may not know and\nunderstand it.", "chunk_order": 43}

T2T strategy entails proper investigations and treatment\nof gout patients so that crippling chronic gouty arthritis, disabling\ncomorbidities, poor quality of life and premature death can be minimised\nor even avoided. In T2T strategy, more visits and frequent blood investigations are\nrequired to ensure SU level of <360 \u00b5mol/L is achieved. This can be\ndone by a dedicated team in both primary and secondary care. It should\ninclude trained allied health care professionals. They can also provide\nregular health education (pathogenesis and natural course of disease,\nlifestyle modification, diet and exercise as well as the importance of\nManagement of Gout (Second Edition)\nadherence to treatment) on gout to improve patient empowerment. Apart from that, appropriate initiation and optimisation of ULT usage\nshould be addressed well. Allopurinol 100 mg tablet should be readily\navailable in primary care and general medicine. The issues discussed above require adequate human and financial\nresources. As gout is the commonest arthritis globally and increasing in\nits prevalence, T2T strategy should be emphasised in gout management\nthroughout all levels of care. 17.3 Clinical Audit Indicators\nThe following are proposed as clinical audit indicators for quality\nmanagement of gout:\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of\nthe CPG by MoH which include launching of the CPG, Quick Reference\nand Training Module. \u2022 Percentage\nof incident gout\npatients indicated\nfor ULT in whom\nULT is actually\nstarted\n=\nNumber of incident gout patients\nindicated for ULT in a year\nNumber of incident gout patients\nindicated for ULT in whom ULT is\nactually started in a year\nx100%\n\u2022 Percentage\nof incident gout\npatients who\nachieve SU level\n<360 \u00b5mol/L\n=\nNumber of incident gout patients\nin the same period\nNumber of incident gout patients who\nachieve SU level <360 \u00b5mol/L in a periodx100%\nManagement of Gout (Second Edition)\nREFERENCES\n1.
