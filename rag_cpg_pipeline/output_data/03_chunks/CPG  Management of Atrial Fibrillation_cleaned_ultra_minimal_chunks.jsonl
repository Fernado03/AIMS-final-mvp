Specifically, these guidelines assist physicians in clinical\ndecision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches\nfor the diagnosis, management, and prevention of AF. Clinical Issues eg: AF\nassessment, best treatment strategy for acute AF & reduce risk of adverse\noutcomes from AF, best long term treatment strategy, management of AF in\nspecific special groups have been addressed in the CPG. In a broader sense, these guidelines emphasized that AF is a worldwide public\nhealth problem with increasing incidence and prevalence, high cost, and poor\noutcomes. Importantly, this AF CPG has provided the framework for a public\nhealth approach to improve the quality of care and outcomes of all individuals with\nAF. This is a major paradigm shift from the focus on AF treatment and care that\nhas dominated the practice to IMPORTANT STRATEGIES eg: risk stratification,\nappropriate antithrombotic therapy, safety consideration of antiarrhythmic agents\nemphasized in rhythm strategy. This latest version has undergone extensive revision in response to comments\nduring the public review. While considerable effort has gone into their preparation\nover the past 2 years, and every attention has been paid to their detail and scientific\nrigor, no set of guidelines, no matter how well developed, achieves its purpose\nunless it is implemented and translated into clinical practice. Implementation is an\nintegral component of the process and accounts for the success of the guidelines. The Work Group is now developing implementation tools essential to the success\nof this AFCPG.

It is their commitment and dedication\nthat has made it all possible. Professor Dr. Sim Kui Hian FNHAM\nNHAM President\nABOUT THE GUIDELINE\nGUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nThis is the first Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Atrial Fibrillation (AF). A\ncommittee was appointed by the National Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM),\nMinistry of Health (MOH) and the Academy of Medicine Malaysia (AMM) to draw up\nthis CPG. It comprises of sixteen members including cardiologists, a neurologist,\na haematologist, a cardiac surgeon, an obstetrician, a gynaecologist, general\nphysicians, an intensivist, a family medicine specialist and an emergency medicine\nspecialist from the government, private sector and the public universities. Objectives\nThis CPG is intended to assist health care providers in clinical decision making\nby describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis,\nmanagement, and prevention of AF. Rigour of Development\nEvidence was obtained by systematic review of current medical literature on Atrial\nFibrillation using the usual search engines \u2013 Guidelines International Network\n(G-I-N), Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR),\nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Journal full text via\nOVID search engine, International Health Technology Assessment websites (refer\nto Appendix A for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved\narticles were searched to identify relevant studies. Search was limited to literature\npublished in English. All searches were officially conducted between 15 January\n2010 and 10 December 2011. We suggest that future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can\nbe obtained upon request from the CPG secretariat.", "chunk_order": 1}

Reference was also made to other guidelines on Atrial Fibrillation, Guidelines\nfor the Management of Atrial Fibrillation published by The Task Force for the\nManagement of Atrial Fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)\n2010, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Atrial Fibrillation\nGuideline 2006, Evidence-based Best Practice Guideline of New Zealand on\nAtrial Fibrillation 2005 and the ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines for the Management\nof Patients With Atrial Fibrillation 2006 were also studied. These CPGs were\nevaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE)\nprior being used as references. Forty-three clinical questions were developed and divided into eight major sections\nand members of the development panel were assigned individual questions within\nthese subtopics (refer to Appendix B for Clinical Questions). The group members\nmet a total 18 times throughout the development of the guideline. All retrieved\nliterature were appraised by at least two members and subsequently presented\nfor discussion during development group meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively by\nmembers of the Development Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient the\nrecommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. These CPG are\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration. On completion, the draft guidelines was sent for review by external reviewers. It\nwas posted on the Ministry of Health of Malaysia official website for comment and\nfeedback from any interested parties. These guidelines had also been presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council,\nMinistry of Health of Malaysia for review and approval. The level of recommendation and the grading of evidence used in this guideline\nwere adapted from the American Heart Association and the European Society of\nCardiology (AHA/ESC) and outlined on page xi.

Any comorbidities that\nmight indicate one approach rather than the other should be taken into\naccount . Irrespective of whether a rate-control or a rhythm-control strategy\nis adopted in patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF, appropriate\nantithrombotic therapy should be used. 5\nWhen choosing an antiarrhythmic agent for rhythm control strategy, safety\nrather than efficacy considerations should primarily guide the choice of\nantiarrhythmic agent. 6\nIn patients with permanent AF, who need treatment for rate control, betablockers or rate-limiting calcium antagonists should be the preferred initial\nmonotherapy in all patients while digoxin should only be considered as\nmonotherapy in predominantly sedentary patients.

The\nsurface ECG is characterized by \u2018absolutely\u2019 irregular RR intervals and the\nabsence of any distinct P waves. The P waves are replaced by fibrillary (F)\nwaves. Atrial Flutter (AFl) in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of\nregular atrial activation called flutter (F) waves on the ECG. AFl commonly\noccurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a regular or irregular ventricular rate of 120\nto 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute).", "chunk_order": 7}

These categories are set out below. (See Table 1 and\nFigure 2)\nTable 1.

These patients have a favourable prognosis with respect to\nthromboembolism and mortality. \u2018Silent AF\u2019 being asymptomatic is detected by an opportunistic ECG or may\npresent as an AF-related complication such as ischemic stroke. This classi\uf0decation is useful for clinical management of AF patients (Figure 1),\nespecially when AF-related symptoms are also considered. AF is a naturally progressive disease except for a small proportion of patients (23%), who are free of AF-promoting conditions (see section 2.1.1, page 5), may\nremain in paroxysmal AF over several decades.1 AF progresses from short rare\nepisodes, to longer and more frequent attacks (See Figure 2). With time, often\nyears, many patients will develop sustained forms of AF. Paroxysm of AF\nepisodes also occurs in cluster and \u201dAF burden\u201d can vary markedly over months\nor years.2\nFigure 1: Different types of AF. AF = atrial fibrillation; CV = cardioversion. The arrhythmia tends to progress\nfrom paroxysmal (self-terminating, usually ,48 h) to persistent [non-self-terminating or requiring\ncardioversion (CV)], long-standing persistent (lasting longer than 1 year) and eventually to permanent\n(accepted) AF. First-onset AF may be the first of recurrent attacks or already be deemed permanent. Asymptomatic AF is common even in symptomatic patients, irrespective of\nwhether the initial presentation was persistent or paroxysmal. This has important\nimplications for strategies aimed at preventing AF-related complications. 2\nAdapted from the ESC Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation (2010 Version) (European heart\nJournal 2010; doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehq278)\n1.3 AF NATURAL TIME COURSE\n1.4 EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PROGNOSIS\nAF is the commonest sustained cardiac arrhythmia.

Information on AF in\nMalaysia is scarce. Hospital practice data may give a biased view of the clinical\nepidemiology of AF, since only one-third of patients with AF may actually have\nbeen admitted to hospital. Data from predominantly western populations suggest the estimated prevalence\nof AF is 0.4% to 1% in the general population. The prevalence of AF doubles with\neach decade of age, from 0.5% at age 50-59 years to almost 9% at age 80-89\nyears.3-4\nThe mortality rate of patients with AF is about double that of patients in sinus\nrhythm.2,5\nAF is associated with a prothrombotic state, intra-atrial stasis, structural heart\ndisease or blood vessel abnormalities and abnormal platelets haemostasis,\nleading to a predisposition to thrombus formation. This prothrombotic state leads\nto stroke and thromboembolism in AF (See Table 1, Page 1). Only antithrombotic\ntherapy has been shown to reduce AF-related deaths.6\n3\nFigure 2 : \u2018Natural\u2019 time course of AF. AF = atrial fibrillation. The dark blue boxes show a typical sequence of\nperiods in AF against a background of sinus rhythm, and illustrate the progression of AF from silent and\nundiagnosed to paroxysmal and chronic forms, at times symptomatic. The upper bars indicate therapeutic\nmeasures that could be pursued. Light blue boxes indicate therapies that have proven effects on \u2018hard\noutcomes\u2019 in AF, such as stroke or acute heart failure.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nUnderstanding the pathophysiology of atrial \uf0debrillation (AF) requires integration\nof\ninformation\nfrom\nclinical,\nhistological,\nelectrophysiological\nand\nechocardiographic sources. There is no single cause or mechanism that results\nin AF, and it may present in a multitude of ways. 2.1 CLINICAL ASPECTS\nThere are many risk factors for developing AF. In the Framingham study the\ndevelopment of AF was associated with increasing age, diabetes, hypertension\nand valve disease. It is also commonly associated with, and complicated by HF\nand strokes. 2.1.1 CAUSES AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS\nAF is often associated with co-existing medical conditions. The underlying\nconditions and factors predisposing patients to AF are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Common cardiac and non-cardiac risk factors of AF.

When AF is\nassociated with other supraventricular arrhythmias, treatment of the primary\narrhythmia reduces or eliminates the recurrence of AF.

AF = atrial fibrillation; CCS-SAF = Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation; EHRA =\nEuropean Heart Rhythm Association. 6\nTable 4: Relevant questions to be put to a patient with suspected or known AF\nDoes the heart rhythm during the episode feel regular or irregular? Is there any precipitating factor such as exercise, emotion, or\nalcohol intake? Are symptoms during the episodes moderate or severe\u2014the severity\nmay be expressed using the EHRA score,3 which is similar to the\nCCS-SAF score.41\nAre the episodes frequent or infrequent, and are they long or short\nlasting? Is there a history of concomitant disease such as hypertension,\ncoronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease,\ncerebrovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, or chronic pulmonary\ndisease? Is there an alcohol abuse habit? Is there a family history of AF? The EHRA symptom score (see Table 5) provides a simple clinical tool for\nassessing symptoms during AF. The score only considers symptoms that are\nattributable to AF and reverse or reduce upon restoration of sinus rhythm or with\neffective rate control. 3.1.1 DETECTION\nThose with undiagnosed AF can receive treatment sooner if an opportunistic\ncase finding is undertaken. Routine palpation of the radial pulse (not less than 20\nseconds) during screening of blood pressure will be a good opportunity to pick up\nundiagnosed atrial fibrillation. In patients presenting with any of the following:\nx breathlessness/dyspnoea,\nx palpitations,\nx syncope/dizziness,\nx chest discomfort or stroke/TIA,\nmanual pulse palpation should be performed to assess for the presence of an\nirregular pulse that may indicate AF. 3.1.1.1 ELECTROCARDIOGRAM\nThe diagnosis of AF requires confirmation by ECG, sometimes in the form\nof bedside telemetry, ambulatory Holter recordings and event loop\nrecordings.2, 10\nIf AF is present at the time of recording, a standard 12-lead ECG is sufficient to\nconfirm the diagnosis.", "chunk_order": 11}

The time of onset of AF should be established to de\uf0dene the type of AF (Figure 2). Patients with AF and signs of acute heart failure require urgent rate control and\noften cardioversion. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be\nperformed in haemodynamically-compromised patients to assess LV and valvular\nfunction and right ventricular pressure. If AF duration is >48 h or there is doubt\nabout its duration, transesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) should be used to\nrule out intracardiac thrombus prior to cardioversion.13\nPatients with stroke or TIA require immediate stroke diagnosis, usually via\nemergency computed tomography (CT). Patients should be assessed for risk of stroke. Most patients with acute AF will\nrequire anticoagulation unless they are at low risk of thromboembolic\ncomplications (no stroke risk factors) and no cardioversion is necessary (e.g. AF\nterminates within 24 \u2013 48 h). After the initial management of symptoms and complications, underlying causes\nof AF should be sought. A TTE is useful to detect ventricular, valvular, and atrial\ndisease as well as rare congenital heart disease. Thyroid function tests, a full\nblood count, a serum creatinine measurement and analysis for proteinuria,\nmeasurement of blood pressure, and a test for diabetes mellitus are useful. A\nserum test for hepatic function may be considered in selected patients. A stress\ntest is reasonable in patients with signs or risk factors for coronary artery\ndisease. Patients with persistent signs of LV dysfunction and/or signs of\nmyocardial ischemia are candidates for coronary angiography\nTable 6 lists the clinical evaluation that may be necessary in patients with AF.", "chunk_order": 12}

(See\nsection 6.4.5, page 38)\n3.4 CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP\nThe specialist caring for the AF patient should not only perform the baseline\nassessment and institute the appropriate treatment, but also suggest a structured\nplan for follow-up. Important considerations during follow-up of the AF patient are listed below:\nx Has the risk pro\uf0dele changed (e.g. new diabetes or hypertension), especially\nwith regard to the indication for anticoagulation? x Is anticoagulation now necessary\u2014have new risk factors developed, or\nhas the need for anticoagulation passed, e.g. postcardioversion in a\npatient with low thrombo-embolic risk? x Have the patient\u2019s symptoms improved on therapy; if not, should other\ntherapy be considered? x Are there signs of proarrhythmia or risk of proarrhythmia; if so, should the\ndose of an antiarrhythmic drug be reduced or a change made to another\ntherapy? x Has paroxysmal AF progressed to a persistent/permanent form, in spite of\nantiarrhythmic drugs; in such a case, should another therapy be\nconsidered? x Is the rate control approach working properly; has the target for heart rate\nat rest and during exercise been reached? The diagnosis of AF requires documentation by ECG.2,10\nIn patients with suspected AF, an attempt to record an ECG should be made\nwhen symptoms suggestive of AF occur.2,14\nA simple symptom score (EHRA class) is recommended to quantify AF-related\nsymptoms.2,15\nAll patients with AF should undergo a thorough physical examination, and a\ncardiac- and arrhythmia-related history should be taken. In patients with severe symptoms, documented or suspected heart disease, or\nrisk factors, an echocardiogram is recommended.2,16,17\nIn patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, a 12-lead ECG should be recorded\nat regular intervals during follow-up. In patients with suspected symptomatic AF, additional ECG monitoring should be\nconsidered in order to document the arrhythmia.2,18\nAdditional ECG monitoring should be considered for detection of \u2018silent\u2019 AF in\npatients who may have sustained an AF-related complication.2,19\nIn patients with AF treated with rate control, Holter ECG monitoring should be\nconsidered for assessment of rate control or bradycardia.

Rate control is needed for most patients with AF unless the heart rate during AF is naturally slow. Rhythm\ncontrol may be added to rate control if the patient is symptomatic despite adequate rate control, or if a rhythm control strategy is selected because of factors such\nas the degree of symptoms, younger age, or higher activity levels. Permanent AF is managed by rate control unless it is deemed possible to restore sinus rhythm\nwhen the AF category is re-designated as \u2018long-standing persistent\u2019. Paroxysmal AF is more often managed with a rhythm control strategy, especially if it is\nsymptomatic and there is little or no associated underlying heart disease.

MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n4.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES\nIn patients with AF or AFI, the aims of treatment involve the following five\nobjectives. I Relief of symptoms, such as palpitations, dizziness, fatigue and dyspnoea,\nis paramount to the patient. II. The prevention of serious complications, such as thromboembolism\n(particularly ischaemic stroke) and heart failure, is equally important. III. Optimal management of concomitant cardiovascular disease. IV. Rate control. V. Correction of rhythm disturbance. These goals are not mutually exclusive and may be pursued simultaneously. The\ninitial strategy may differ from the long-term therapeutic goal. A fundamental question to be answered for every patient with AF or AFI is\nwhether to obtain and maintain sinus rhythm by pharmacological or\nnonpharmacological means (a rhythm-control strategy), or whether to aim\nprimarily to control heart rate rather than the rhythm (a rate-control strategy). For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be\nanticoagulation and rate control while the long-term goal is to restore sinus\nrhythm.", "chunk_order": 15}

For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be\nanticoagulation and rate control while the long-term goal is to restore sinus\nrhythm. If rate control offers inadequate symptomatic relief, restoration of sinus rhythm\nbecomes a clear long-term goal. When cardioversion is contemplated and the\nduration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48 h, anticoagulation will be necessary. Early cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening\nheart failure. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older\npatients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In\nsome circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as\nfor instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term\ntherapy may be necessary. Regardless of the approach, the need for anticoagulation is based on stroke risk\nand not on whether sinus rhythm is maintained. For rate and rhythm control, drugs remain the first choice. Radiofrequency\nablation may be considered in symptomatic AF and in lone AF to avoid long-term\ndrug therapy. In selected individuals undergoing cardiac surgery, surgical maze\nprocedure may be a therapeutic option. 4.2 THROMBOEMBOLIC PROPHYLAXIS\nAntithrombotic therapy must be considered in all patients with AF. Strategies that\nmay reduce thromboembolic risk include the following treatments:\n\u2022 Anticoagulants such as Vitamin K Antagonist,\n\u2022 Antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel\n\u2022 Intravenous (IV) heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)\n\u2022 Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion, either surgically or percutaneously. The decision regarding the method of reduction in the risk of stroke, should take\ninto account both the person\u2019s risk of thromboembolism and their risk of bleeding. It is important to remember that vitamin K antagonist such as Warfarin is very\neffective and reduces the risk of stroke overall by two thirds. (For details see\nSection 6, page 26)\n4.3. HEART RATE CONTROL VERSUS RHYTHM CONTROL\nRate control involves the use of chronotropic drugs or electrophysiological or\nsurgical interventions to reduce the rapid heart rate (ventricular rate) often found\nin patients with AF. Although the atria continue to fibrillate with this strategy, it is\nnonetheless thought to be an effective treatment as it improves symptoms and\nreduces the risk of associated morbidity. However, the persistence of the\narrhythmia continues the risk of stroke and thromboembolic events occurring. Administering antithrombotic drugs reduces this risk. (See Figure 3, page 12)\nRhythm control involves the use of electrical or pharmacological cardioversion or\nelectrophysiological or surgical interventions to convert the arrhythmia associated\nwith AF to normal sinus rhythm.", "chunk_order": 16}

The consistent \uf0dending in all \uf0deve studies was that rhythm control offered no\nsurvival advantage and, in most cases, had little effect on morbidity and quality of\nlife. However, it should be emphasised that these conclusions are not necessarily\napplicable to all groups of patients. The \uf0deve recent studies enrolled mostly older\npatients with additional risk factors for stroke, many of whom also had heart\nfailure. Younger patients with normal hearts and primarily paroxysmal atrial\n\uf0debrillation (PAF) were not well represented. Importantly, in a prede\uf0dened subgroup\nof AFFIRM participants aged less than 65 years, hazard ratios for death showed\na paradoxical trend towards superiority of the rhythm-control strategy. The initial therapy after onset of AF should always include adequate\nantithrombotic treatment and control of the ventricular rate. If the ultimate goal is\nrestoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, rate control medication should be\ncontinued throughout follow-up, unless continuous sinus rhythm is present. The\ngoal is to control the ventricular rate adequately whenever recurrent AF occurs. The decision to add rhythm control therapy to the management of AF requires an\nindividual decision and should therefore be discussed at the beginning of AF\nmanagement. Before choosing rate control alone as a long-term strategy, the\nclinician should consider how permanent AF is likely to affect the individual\npatient in the future and how successful rhythm control is expected to be (Figure\n3, page 12). Symptoms related to AF are an important determinant in making the\ndecision to opt for rate or rhythm control (e.g. globally assessed by the EHRA\nscore, Table 5, page 7), in addition to factors that may in\uf0dfuence the success of\nrhythm control.

MANAGEMENT \u2013 ACUTE-ONSET AF\n5.1 ACUTE AF IN HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE PATIENTS\nThe majority of patients who present with AF are hemodynamically stable but\nthere is a small group of patients who are significantly compromised by the onset\nof AF. These patients require immediate hospitalization and urgent intervention\nto prevent further deterioration. Those considered in this group are; 33\nx Those with a ventricular rate greater than 150 bpm\nx With ongoing chest pains, or\nx Critical perfusion. In these circumstances, the concerns regarding intervention in the absence of\nanticoagulation and echocardiography are counterbalanced by the need for\nurgent treatment. 5.1.1 ACUTE RATE CONTROL\nIt is important to understand that in these circumstances the slow onset of\ndigoxin makes it inappropriate for use in this situation. Patients whose AF is\nassociated with thyrotoxicosis will not respond to any measures until the\nunderlying thyroid disease is first treated. Patients with accessory pathway such\nas the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome are particularly at risk following\nthe onset of AF because they can present with very rapid ventricular rates\n(greater than 200 bpm) and may need specific management. When patients present with unacceptably high ventricular rate the primary aim is\none of rate control. AF with slow ventricular rates may respond to atropine (0.5 \u2013 2 mg i.v.), but many\npatients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmia may require either urgent placement\nof a temporary pacemaker lead in the right ventricle and/or cardioversion.", "chunk_order": 19}

IIIC\n5.1.2 PHARMACOLOGICAL CARDIOVERSION\nIn the presence of other cardiac abnormalities (e.g. hypertensive heart disease,\nvalvular heart disease), onset of AF with acceptable ventricular rates may still\ncompromised cardiac function. While rate control is unlikely to bring about clinical\nimprovement in these circumstances, there is a need for the restoration of sinus\nrhythm. 19\nIC\nPharmacological cardioversion of AF may be initiated by a bolus administration\nof an antiarrhythmic drug. Although the conversion rate with antiarrhythmic drugs\nis lower than with direct current cardioversion (DCCV), it does not require\nconscious sedation or anesthesia, and may facilitate the choice of antiarrhythmic\ndrug therapy to prevent recurrent AF. Most patients who undergo pharmacological cardioversion require continuous\nmedical supervision and ECG monitoring during the drug infusion and for a\nperiod afterwards (usually about half the drug elimination half-life) to detect\nproarrhythmic events such as ventricular proarrhythmia, sinus node arrest, or\natrioventricular block. Several agents are available for pharmacological cardioversion (see Table 10 on\npage 20).

Successful DCCV\nis usually de\uf0dened as termination of AF, documented as the presence of two or\nmore consecutive P waves after shock delivery. 5.1.3.1 Procedure\nUnless adequate anticoagulation has been documented for 4 weeks or AF is \u001f48\nh from a de\uf0denite onset, a TOE should be performed to rule out atrial thrombi (see\nFigure 9, page 39). A pacing catheter or external pacing pads may be needed if asystole or\nbradycardia occurs. Evidence favours the use of biphasic external de\uf0debrillators because of their lower\nenergy requirements and greater efficacy compared with monophasic\nde\uf0debrillators. Trials have demonstrated a signi\uf0decant increase in the \uf0derst shock\nsuccess rate of DCCV for AF when biphasic waveforms were used. Currently, two conventional positions are commonly used for electrode\nplacement (see Figure 5). Several studies have shown that anteroposterior\nelectrode placement is more effective than anterolateral placement.43 If initial\nshocks are unsuccessful for terminating the arrhythmia, the electrodes should be\nrepositioned and cardioversion repeated. The recommended initial energy for synchronised cardioversion (see figure 6) is:\nx 200J or greater with monophasic waveform\nx 100J or greater with biphasic waveform\nx 10-50J biphasic waveform for AFL\nOutpatient/day care DCCV can be undertaken in patients who are\nhaemodynamically stable and do not have severe underlying heart disease. At\nleast 3 h of ECG and haemodynamic monitoring are needed after the procedure,\nbefore the patient is allowed to leave the hospital.

The procedure is associated with 1 \u2013 2% risk of thromboembolism, which can be\nreduced by adequate anticoagulation in the weeks prior to cardioversion or by\nexclusion of left atrium thrombi before the procedure. Skin burns are a common\ncomplication. In patients with sinus node dysfunction, especially in elderly\npatients with structural heart disease, prolonged sinus arrest without an adequate\nescape rhythm may occur. Dangerous arrhythmias, such as ventricular\ntachycardia and \uf0debrillation, may arise in the presence of hypokalaemia, digitalis\nintoxication, or improper synchronization. The patient may become hypoxic or\nhypoventilate from sedation, but hypotension and pulmonary oedema are rare. 5.1.3.3 Cardioversion in patients with implanted pacemakers and\nde\uf0debrillators\nThe electrode paddle should be at least 8 cm from the pacemaker battery, and\nthe antero-posterior paddle positioning is recommended. Biphasic shocks are\npreferred because they require less energy for AF termination. In pacemakerdependent patients, an increase in pacing threshold should be anticipated. In the\nabsence of a pacemaker programmer, a pacing magnet may be placed over the\npacemaker generator pocket to provide temporary pacing support. These\npatients should be monitored carefully. After cardioversion, the device should be\ninterrogated and evaluated to ensure normal function. 5.1.3.4 Recurrence after cardioversion\nRecurrences after DCCV can be divided into three phases:\n(1) Immediate recurrences, which occur within the \uf0derst few minutes after DCCV. (2) Early recurrences, which occur during the \uf0derst 5 days after DCCV. Figure 6 : ECG strip showing synchronized cardioversion\n(3) Late recurrence, which occur thereafter. Factors that predispose to AF recurrence are age, AF duration before\ncardioversion, number of previous recurrences, an increased LA size or reduced\nLA function, and the presence of coronary heart disease or pulmonary or mitral\nvalve disease. Atrial ectopic beats with a long \u2013 short sequence, faster heart\nrates, and variations in atrial conduction increase the risk of AF recurrence.

MANAGEMENT - PREVENTION OF THROMBOEMBOLISM\n6.1 RISK STRATIFICATION FOR STROKE\nAssessment of thromboembolic risk or risk stratification allows the clinician to\nconsider anticoagulant treatment for those people who are at an increased risk of\nstroke. Two recent systematic reviews have addressed the evidence base for stroke risk\nfactors in AF,49,50 and concluded that prior stroke/TIA/thrombo-embolism, age,\nhypertension, diabetes, and structural heart disease are important risk factors. The presence of moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction TTE is the only\nindependent echocardiographic risk factor for stroke on multivariable analysis. On TOE, the presence of LA thrombus, complex aortic plaques, spontaneous\necho-contrast and low LAA velocities are independent predictors of stroke and\nthrombo-embolism. Patients with paroxysmal AF should be regarded as having a stroke risk similar\nto those with persistent or permanent AF, in the presence of risk factors. Patients aged less than 60 years, with \u2018lone AF\u2019, i.e. no clinical history or physical\nevidence of cardiovascular disease, carry a very low cumulative stroke risk,\nestimated to be 1.3% over 15 years. The various stroke clinical risk factors has led to publication of various stroke\nschemes.51,52 The simplest risk assessment scheme is the CHADS2 score and as\nshown in Table 11, has good stroke correlation.", "chunk_order": 25}

The CHADS2 [cardiac failure,\nhypertension, age, diabetes, stroke (doubled)] risk index evolved from the AF\nInvestigators and Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) Investigators\ncriteria, and is based on a point system in which 2 points are assigned for a\nhistory of stroke or TIA and 1 point each is assigned for age >75 years, a history\nof hypertension, diabetes, or recent cardiac failure.51\nThe CHADS2 stroke risk strati\uf0decation scheme should be used as an initial, rapid,\nand easy-to-remember means of assessing stroke risk. In patients with a\nCHADS2 score \u00952, chronic OAC therapy with a VKA is recommended in a doseadjusted approach to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) target of 2.5\n(range, 2.0 \u2013 3.0), unless contraindicated.6,52\nTable 11: CHADS2 score and stroke rate\nA comparison of the 12 published risk-strati\uf0decation49 schemes to predict stroke in\npatients with non-valvular AF found that most had very modest predictive value\nfor stroke and the proportion of patients assigned to individual risk categories\nvaried widely across the schemes. The CHADS2 score categorized most subjects\nas \u2018moderate risk\u2019. The choice of antithrombotic (anticoagulants or antiplatelets)\nfor the \u2018moderate risk\u2019 group was at best uncertain. Several published analyses 49,50,53-55 have found even patients at \u2018moderate risk\u2019\n(currently de\uf0dened as CHADS2 score =1, i.e. one risk factor) still derive signi\uf0decant\nbene\uf0det from OAC over aspirin use, often with low rates of major haemorrhage. Importantly, prescription of an antiplatelet agent was not associated with a lower\nrisk of adverse events. Also, the CHADS2 score does not include many stroke risk factors, and other\n\u2018stroke risk modi\uf0deers\u2019 need to be considered in a comprehensive stroke risk\nassessment (see Table 11, page 27). Rather than the use of the \u2018low\u2019, \u2018moderate\u2019, and \u2018high\u2019 risk characterization that\nonly showed a modest predictive value, this guideline has adopted and recognize\nthat risk is a continuum. A risk factor-based approach for a more detailed stroke\nrisk assessment is encouraged for recommending the use of antithrombotic\ntherapy. aThe adjusted stroke rate was derived from the multivariable analysis assuming no aspirin usage; these\nstroke rates are based on data from a cohort of hospitalized AF patients, published in 2001, with low\nnumbers in those with a CHADS2 score of 5 and 6 to allow an accurate judgement of the risk in these\npatients.

The annual risks of intracranial haemorrhage increased from 0.1% in control to\n0.3% in VKA groups, which represents an excess of two intracranial bleeds per\nannum per 1,000 patients treated. Even low-dose aspirin increases the risk of major haemorrhage by two-fold,\nespecially in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension. Controlling and monitoring of hypertension and other associated co morbidities is\nextremely important in minimizing the risk of bleeding in patients on prophylactic\nOAC. The fear of falls may be overstated, as a patient may need to fall 300 times per\nyear for the risk of intracranial haemorrhage to outweigh the bene\uf0det of OAC in\nstroke prevention. While these factors are often cited as reasons for non-prescription of VKA in the\nelderly, the absolute benefit is likely to be greatest in this same group in view of\ntheir high risk.68\n6.6.2 RISK SCORE FOR BLEEDING\nThe bleeding risk score HAS-BLED was formulated by incorporating risk factors\nfrom a derivation cohort of a large population database of the prospective Euro\nHeart Survey on AF.82 The clinical characteristic comprising the HAS-BLED\nbleeding risk score is shown in Table 14.

(6) Safety rather than efficacy considerations should primarily guide the choice\nof antiarrhythmic agent\n8.1 EFFICACY OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS IN PREVENTING\nRECURRENT ATRIAL \uf0deBRILLATION\nIn a recent meta-analysis of 44 randomized controlled trials comparing\nantiarrhythmic drugs against control,105 the antiarrhymic drugs signi\uf0decantly\nreduced the rate of recurrent AF. Overall, the likelihood of maintaining sinus\nrhythm is approximately doubled by the use of antiarrhythmic drugs.106\nAmiodarone was superior to class I agents and sotalol. The number of patients needed to treat for 1 year was 2 \u2013 9. Withdrawal due to\nside effects was frequent (1 in 9 \u2013 27 patients), and all drugs except amiodarone\nand propafenone increased the incidence of proarrhythmia.105 The number of\npatients needed to harm was 17 \u2013 119. Most of the trials included in the analysis\nenrolled relatively healthy patients without severe concomitant cardiac disease. Although mortality was low in all studies (0 \u2013 4.4%), rapidly dissociating sodium\nchannel blockers (disopyramide phosphate, quinidine sulfate) were associated\nwith increased mortality. 8.2 CHOICE OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS\nAntiarrhythmic therapy for recurrent AF is recommended on the basis of\nchoosing safer, although possibly less efficacious, medication before resorting to\nmore effective but less safe therapy.

For each of these it has been recommended that speci\uf0dec\ndrugs be avoided.

Amiodarone is the most efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for the prevention of\nrecurrent AF. However, several meta-analyses105,109-111 have failed to identify a\nbene\uf0decial effect of amiodarone on cardiovascular outcomes. In view of the better\nsafety and potential outcome bene\uf0det, dronedarone may be preferable as the \uf0derst\nantiarrhythmic option, at least in patients with symptomatic AF and underlying\ncardiovascular disease. Should dronedarone fail to control symptoms,\namiodarone might then be necessary. Dronedarone can be used safely in patients with ACS, chronic stable angina,\nhypertensive heart disease.

A systematic review of 58 studies in 8565 patients has shown that interventions\nto prevent and/or treat post-operative AF with \u00df-blockers, sotalol, or amiodarone\nand, less convincingly, atrial pacing, are favoured with respect to outcome.153\n9.1.1 PREVENTION OF POST-OPERATIVE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION\n\u00df-Blocker therapy is most effective when provided both before and after cardiac\nsurgery compared with only before or after surgery.153-155 Withdrawal of \u00dfblockers is a signi\uf0decant risk factor for the development of post-operative AF and\nshould be avoided. Treatment should be started at least 1 week before surgery\nwith a \u00df-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Prophylactic amiodarone decreased the incidence of post- operative AF156. The\nbene\uf0decial effect of amiodarone has been consistently demonstrated in a\nsystematic review.153The adverse effects of perioperative prophylactic i.v. amiodarone include an increased probability of post-operative bradycardia and\nhypotension.153\nSotalol has been reported to reduce the incidence of post-operative AF by 64%\ncompared with placebo.153 However, the use of sotalol places patients at risk of\nbradycardia and torsade de pointes, especially those with electrolyte\ndisturbances, and its use in post-operative AF is limited. Meta-analyses demonstrated that corticosteroid therapy was associated with a\n26 \u2013 45% reduction in post-operative AF and shorter hospital stay.157 However,\nthe potential adverse effects on glucose metabolism, wound healing, and\ninfection, make their use for prevention of AF as controversial.

When ventricular rate control is required in patients with heart failure and AF, \u00dfblockers are preferred over digitalis glycosides due to their rate-controlling effect\nduring exertion rather than only at rest. A combination of digoxin and a \u00df-blocker\nmay be more effective than a single drug for heart-rate control at rest. Therapy\nwith \u00df-blockers alone or in combination with digoxin was associated with lower\nmortality rates compared with treatment with digoxin alone.184\n\u00df-Blockers have favourable effects on mortality and morbidity in patients with\nsystolic heart failure. A recent meta-analysis also showed a 27% reduction in the\nincidence of new-onset AF in patients with systolic heart failure treated with \u00dfblockers.185\nAlthough diltiazem effectively controls excessive heart rate during exercise, it\nadversely suppresses myocardial contraction and increases the risk of heart\nfailure. For patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, these drugs\nused in combination with digoxin appear to be more effective in controlling heart\nrate over 24 h and during exercise than digoxin or non-dihydropyridine calcium\nchannel antagonist monotherapy. The rhythm control strategy has not been shown to be superior to rate control in\nheart failure patients with AF.27 Catheter-based LA ablation procedures in heart\nfailure patients may lead to improvement in LV function, exercise tolerance, and\nquality of life in selected patients (see Section 8.3.1).29,30\n64\nIC\nIIaC\nDCCV is recommended when a rapid ventricular rate does not respond to\npharmacological measures in patients with AF and ongoing myocardial\nischaemia, symptomatic hypotension, or symptoms of pulmonary congestion.

Rate control is difficult to achieve in athletes. \u00df-blockers are not well tolerated\nand may even be prohibited in some competitive sports, and digoxin or nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists will not be potent enough to slow heart rate\nduring exertional AF. When the heart rate during AF is acceptable at maximal physical performance for\na given athlete without signs of haemodynamic impairment (dizziness, syncope,\nsudden fatigue), competitive sports activity can be resumed. Caution is necessary when using flecainide and propafenone as monotherapy in\nathletes with AF.192 These drugs may lead to atrial \uf0dfutter, with 1 to 1 conduction\nto the ventricles during high sympathetic tone. Therefore, ablation of the \uf0dfutter\ncircuit may be needed in athletes with documented atrial \uf0dfutter. Continuation of\ndrug therapy for AF will often be required despite successful ablation (\u2018hybrid\ntherapy\u2019).
