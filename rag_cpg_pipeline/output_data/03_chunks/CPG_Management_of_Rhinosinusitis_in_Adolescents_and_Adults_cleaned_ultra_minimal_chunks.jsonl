Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were issued in 2016 and will be reviewed in 2020 or\nsooner if new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating,\nthe Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty\nwill be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for\na revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary\nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used\nby MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee\n(RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platform: Guidelines International Network\n(G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews\n(CDSR) and PubMed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The inclusion criteria are all adolescents and adults (age\nmore than 12 years) with rhinosinusitis regardless of study design. The search was limited to literature published in the last ten years\nand on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of all\nretrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in the\nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom 12 May 2014 to 12 June 2014. Literature search was repeated\nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process\nallowing any relevant papers published before 28 February 2015 to be\nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after\nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis\nand Nasal Polyps developed by International Rhinology Society in 2012. The CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research\nand Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to it being used as reference. A total of 24 clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 25 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC.", "chunk_order": 2}

Any\ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based\nlargely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.

INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION\nSinusitis is a common health problem characterised by mucosal\ninflammation of the paranasal sinuses. However, it often coexists with\nrhinitis in most patients. Hence the current accepted terminology is\nrhinosinusitis. Rhinosinusitis (RS) can be divided into two subtypes: acute and chronic\nbased on the duration of the symptoms. The clinical presentation\nincludes nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, headache, decreased sense of\nsmell, postnasal drip, facial pressure or pain, fever, sore throat and\ncough. Predisposing factors for RS are multifactorial, which includes\ninfection, allergies, and air pollution. RS poses a major health problem. The disease and its effect on\nquality of life, productivity, and finances are substantial. Although it is a\ncommon illness, RS presents a number of diagnostic and management\nchallenges to the practicing clinician. The aim of this guideline is to help the healthcare providers in both\ngovernment and private practice to manage RS and its subtypes,\nincluding acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)\nwith or without nasal polyposis. 2.", "chunk_order": 6}

It is a minimally invasive technique that\nuses an endoscope to enlarge the drainage pathways resulting in\nimprovement of ventilation and restoration of nasal cavity and paranasal\nsinuses physiological function. Surgical intervention is considered when optimum medical therapy fails\nin CRS or ARS with orbital or intracranial complications, despite the\nabsence of high level evidence due to ethical concerns in RCTs on\nsurgical procedures. Indications for surgery in ARS are presence of orbital or intracranial\nabscess on CT scan or no clinical improvement after 24 - 48 hours of\nintravenous antibiotics.1, level III\nA high quality Health Technology Assessment (HTA) found that clinical\nsymptoms improve following FESS compared with conventional\nprocedures (simple polypectomy, intranasal ethmoidectomy and\nCaldwell-Luc procedure) in CRS. There were relatively few complications\nwith FESS. However, there were some methodological limitations in the\nevidence. There is a clear need for quality-controlled trials to assess the\neffectiveness of FESS.45, level I\nFESS significantly reduces nasal obstruction, loss of smell and polyp\nsize compared with medical treatment in CRSwNP.46, level I Apart from\nnasal obstruction, FESS also improves postnasal drip and headache\nsignificantly in CRSwNP.47, level II-3 Patients with CRSwNP have better\nquality of life post-operatively compared with those without polyps\n(p=0.044).48, level II-3\nOptimal medical therapy is as equally effective as FESS in CRSsNP.49, level I\nA Cochrane systematic review and a HTA showed that FESS is a\nsafe surgical procedure with minor complications ranging from 1.1 to\n20.8%.45, level I; 49, level I\nRecommendation 8\n\u2022 Surgery should be considered in acute rhinosinusitis with orbital or\nintracranial complications. \u2022 Functional endoscopic sinus surgery should be offered in patients\nwith chronic rhinosinusitis who fail optimal medical treatment.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of CPG is important as it helps in providing quality\nhealthcare services based on best available evidence applied to local\nscenario and expertise. Various factors and resource implications\nshould be considered for the success of the uptake in the CPG\nrecommendations. 9.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:\n\u2022 availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies)\n\u2022 conferences and updates on management of RS\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n\u2022 limited awareness in managing and referrals of RS among\nhealthcare providers\n\u2022 inadequate RS training at all levels of healthcare providers\n\u2022 variation in RS treatment at different levels of care due to\nadministrative and financial constraints\n\u2022 lacking continuum of RS care at all levels of healthcare, both in\npublic and private settings\n9.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitments to:\n\u2022 ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers via\nprinted copies and easy online accessibility\n\u2022 reinforce training of healthcare providers via regular seminars and\nworkshops\n\u2022 develop a multidisciplinary team in all levels of health care\nManagement of Rhinosinusitis in Adolescents and Adults\nTo assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed\nas clinical audit indicators for quality management:\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of\nthe CPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module.

A correct technique is essential for effective delivery of the medicines. Different nasal spray requires slightly different techniques (for example,\npriming technique or holding position). Hence, it is very important to\nfollow the instructions from your healthcare providers and refer to the\nproduct labels. Nasal sprays are only intended for use in the nose. Do not spray it into\nany other parts of the body. Usage of Nasal Spray for the First Time (Priming)\n1. Remove the dust cap (Picture A). 2. Shake the nasal spray bottle. 3. Picture B shows how to hold nasal spray correctly. Press down a\nfew times until you see a fine mist of spray comes out (You might\nneed to press 3 - 5 times depending on the nasal spray). This\nprocess is called Priming. 4. Priming is only done once for every nasal spray. However, if the\nnasal spray has not been used for more than 1 - 2 weeks, the\npriming step has to be repeated. Dust Cap\nApplicator\nApplicator Tip\nManagement of Rhinosinusitis in Adolescents and Adults\nUsage of Nasal Spray after Priming\n1. Gently blow your nose to clear the mucous (Picture C). 2. Remove the dust cap. 3. Close one nostril with your finger. Bend your head slightly forward. Carefully insert the applicator tip \u00bc or \u00bd inch into the other nostril\n(point the applicator tip slightly outwards, away from the centre of\nthe nose) (Picture D). 4. Press down the nasal spray once and at the same time breathe in\nslowly through your nostril. (Picture E)\n5. Repeat step 4 in the other nostril. 6. Do not tilt your head backwards to prevent backflow into your\nthroat. 7. If the medicine drips into your throat, you will feel a slightly bitter\nsensation in your mouth. This is normal. 8.", "chunk_order": 24}

Once you are done using the nasal spray, wipe the applicator tip\nwith a clean tissue or cloth and put on the dust cap. 9. Try not to sneeze or blow your nose immediately after using the\nnasal spray. Tips While Using the Nasal Spray\n1. Do not breathe in strongly and quickly to prevent the medication\nfrom going into your throat. 2. If the nasal spray is used correctly, the medicine will not drip from\nyour nose nor will it drip into your oral cavity. 3. Please use the nasal spray as directed by your healthcare\nproviders. 4. If you experience any nosebleed following the used of nasal sprays,\nstop using the nasal spray and seek medical attention. Keep the nasal spray away from direct sunlight and children.
