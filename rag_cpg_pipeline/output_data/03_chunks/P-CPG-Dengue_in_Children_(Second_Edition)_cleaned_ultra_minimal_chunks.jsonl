Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. UPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2020 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2024) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When\nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken\nto ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of\npublication.

The\nquality of each retrieved evidence and its effect size are carefully\nassessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group. In formulating\nthe recommendations, overall balances of the following aspects are\nconsidered in determining the strength of the recommendations:-\n\u2022 overall quality of evidence\n\u2022 balance of benefits versus harms\n\u2022 values and preferences\n\u2022 resource implications\n\u2022 equity, feasibility and acceptability\nii\nLevel\nI\nII-1\nII-2\nII-3\nIII\nStudy design\nEvidence from at least one properly randomised controlled trial\nEvidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without\nrandomisation\nEvidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control\nanalytic studies, preferably from more than one centre or\ngroup\nEvidence from multiple time series with or without intervention;\ndramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the\nresults of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s)\ncould also be regarded as this type of evidence\nOpinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience;\ndescriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert\ncommittees\nManagement of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)\niii\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these CPG were\nfrom the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Education (MoE).", "chunk_order": 2}

A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and Embase. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion\ncriteria are all children with suspected and confirmed dengue infection\nregardless of study design. The first search was limited to literature\npublished in the last 14 years (2004 - 2018) and on humans specifically\nchildren with unspecified age and in English. In addition, the reference\nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts\nin the field contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were\nconducted from 30 October 2018 to 7 November 2018. Literature\nsearch was repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG\ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before\n7 February 2020 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search\nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other guidelines on dengue in children\nas listed below:\n\u2022 Paediatric Protocols for Malaysian Hospitals (Fourth Edition)\n\u2022 Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue\n\u2022 Dengue Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and\nControl\nA total of 12 main clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG members met 14 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based\nlargely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration. Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)\nThe literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE II). On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback\nfrom any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to\nthe Technical Advisory Committee for CPG and, the Health Technology\nAssessment (HTA) and CPG Council, MoH Malaysia, for review\nand approval.", "chunk_order": 3}

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Epidemiology\nDengue fever (DF) is a common and serious mosquito-borne viral\ndisease. It is caused by dengue virus (DENV) which has four serotypes\n(DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). All serotypes are found in Malaysia\nand the predominant serotype changes from year to year. The vector for DENV is a mosquito from the genus Aedes which has a\nbiting preference for certain times of the day i.e. the morning and late\nafternoon. A. aegypti is considered as the principal species as it only\nfeeds on humans and can adapt to cohabit with humans in both urban\nand rural environments. A.", "chunk_order": 8}

A. aegypti is considered as the principal species as it only\nfeeds on humans and can adapt to cohabit with humans in both urban\nand rural environments. A. albopictus on the other hand is less efficient\nto spread DENV since it feeds on both human and animal blood. The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in\nrecent decades. The actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported\nand many are misclassified. World Health Organization reports a\nmodelling estimate of 390 million dengue infections per year (95% CI\n284 to 528), with 96 million (95% CI 67 to 136) manifesting clinically\n(with any severity of the disease).1, level III\nIn Malaysia, the number of dengue cases and incidence rate (IR)\ncontinues to increase with the highest number ever reported in 2019. In that year, a total of 130,101 dengue cases were reported which was\nequivalent to an IR of 390.4 cases per 100,000 population. During the period 2000 - 2019, the annual number of dengue cases\nin Malaysia varied substantially, from the lowest value of 7,103 cases\n(30/100,000 population) in 2000 and reaching a peak of 120,836\ncases (390/100,000 population) in 2015. After the peak, there was a\ndownward trend in 2016, 2017, 2018 with yearly reduction of 16.1%,\n17.3% and 3.9% of cases respectively. However, in 2019, there was an\nincrease of 61.4% in dengue cases. Refer to Figure 1. Management of Dengue in Children (Second Edition)\n2\nFigure 1. Annual number and incidence rate of dengue in\nMalaysia, 2000 - 2019\nSource: Analysis of dengue cases in Malaysia. Disease Control Division, Ministry of\nHealth Malaysia. 2020 (unpublished document). DENV affects all age groups worldwide. Thus, children are also not\nspared from dengue infection and their management proves to be\nchallenging. It has been estimated by World Health Organization\n(WHO) that 500,000 people with severe dengue require hospitalisation\neach year, a large proportion of whom are children.2 - 3, level III\nIn the majority of children (0 - 12 years old), dengue causes flu-like\nillness which might be difficult to differentiate from other febrile illness\n(OFI) and seldom causes death. The severe form that leads to plasma\nleakage and shock is the cause of death among children in some Asian\nand Latin America countries.3, level III In Malaysia, the annual percentage\nof cases among children has increased from 2014 to the current\npercentage of about 20% in 2019 (refer to Figure 2).", "chunk_order": 9}

Disease Control Division, Ministry of\nHealth Malaysia. 2020 (unpublished document). 1.2 Classification\nDengue classification has undergone major changes since 2009. The\nprevious 1997 classification of DF and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)\ndrew much criticisms since the case definition of DHF was too rigid\nand not applicable in primary care or resource-limited settings. Another\nissue was that the old case definition failed to identify a significant\nproportion of dengue cases that were severe in nature involving certain\ntarget organs. Severe manifestations e.g. central nervous system\n(encephalopathy) and hepatic failure were not included in the old\ndefinition. The emphasis of the old classification was more on bleeding\nmanifestations, hence the nomenclature of DF and DHF were used. Findings from a multicentre study by DENCO study group led to the\nnew clinical classification.4, level II-2; 5, level III Malaysia has adopted these\nnew classifications for use in clinical management and clinical audit of\nmortality cases. New terms like dengue with/without warning signs and\nsevere dengue are used to emphasise that not only bleeding causes\nproblems in dengue but increased vascular permeability leading to\nplasma leakage can tip an in individual over to a severe form of dengue.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nDengue in children has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations\nranging from non-severe to life-threatening. Refer to Figure 3 for\ncommon symptoms and signs of the condition. Dengue illness begins abruptly after an incubation period of 4 - 10 days\nfollowing the mosquito bite. It encompasses three phases as discussed\nbelow. a. Febrile phase\nThis phase usually lasts 2 - 7 days. Common features include:\n\u2022 abrupt high-grade fever\n\u2022 facial flushing, skin erythema, generalised body ache, myalgia,\narthralgia, retro-orbital pain, photophobia, rubelliform exanthema\nand headache\n\u2022 anorexia, nausea and vomiting\nThese features are also present in OFI which might be difficult to\ndifferentiate from DF. Refer to Table 2. The earliest abnormality in full blood count (FBC) is a gradual drop in\nwhite cell counts, which should alert the doctor to a high probability\nof dengue. Haematological manifestations are mild e.g. petechiae,\nmucosal membrane bleeding (nose, gum), easy bruising or bleeding at\nvenepuncture sites.10, level III\nComplications e.g. dehydration and febrile seizures may occur during\nthis phase. b. Critical phase\nThis phase usually begins after the third (or earlier) day of illness but can\nbe as late as day eight of illness. It typically occurs around the time of\ndefervescence (temperature drops to and remains below 38\u00baC. Plasma\nleakage may occur as a result of increased capillary permeability and\nis manifested by warning signs (refer to yellow box below).", "chunk_order": 11}

Significant critical phase usually lasts 24 - 48 hours, mostly worse\naround defervescence. Some children may enter this phase before\ndefervescence. The initiation of plasma leakage is signalled by an\nelevated HCT and rapid onset of thrombocytopenia or warning signs. The HCT level is closely associated with loss of plasma volume and the\nhigher the level of haemoconcentration, the greater the severity of the\ndisease.13, level III However, majority of children recover spontaneously or\nafter a short period of fluid therapy. Continuous vascular permeability and plasma leakage give rise to\nhypovolaemia and shock. Severe plasma leakage leads to dengue\nshock syndrome (DSS). Severe organ involvement may develop e.g. severe hepatitis, encephalitis and myocarditis, and/or severe bleeding\neven without obvious plasma leakage or shock. \u2022 Pathophysiology of plasma leakage and shock in dengue\nIncreased capillary permeability is the main pathophysiological\nabnormality seen in dengue infection which results in plasma leakage into\nthe extravascular compartment.3, level III This results in haemoconcentration\nand hypovolaemia or shock. Shock in dengue is a physiological\ncontinuum, from asymptomatic capillary leakage to compensated shock,\nthen hypotensive shock and eventually cardiac arrest.10, level III The\nmechanisms that lead to severe dengue are not well established.

IV fluid should be administered\nusing infusion/syringe pumps. A detailed fluid balance of all inputs and outputs should be maintained. Urine output should be checked regularly (each hour until the patient is\nout of shock, then every 1 - 2 hours). A continuous bladder catheter is\nessential in close monitoring of urine output. An acceptable urine output\nwould be at least 0.5 - 1 ml/kg/hour. Input/output ratio should not be\nused as sole determinant in fluid resuscitation as input is typically much\ngreater than output during critical phase.10, level III\nIf previously not detectable, pleural effusion and ascites are usually\ndetectable after fluid boluses. Monitoring with bedside ultrasonography\nmay be used if available. More importantly, monitor their effects on\nbreathing and assess the need of respiratory support.10, level III\nIf blood gas machine is available, HCT, lactate and acidosis level should\nbe repeatedly analysed using capillary or venous blood to monitor\nchanges in the circulation.

PREVENTION STRATEGIES\n9.1 Vaccination\nThree multicentre placebo-controlled RCTs looked into the efficacy and\nsafety of CYD-TDV vaccine against dengue in children. In the first RCT, the dengue vaccine was moderately efficacious\n(54.8%, 95% CI 46.8 to 61.7) in symptomatic, virologically confirmed\ndengue (VCD) with good safety profile when given as three injections\n(months 0, 6 and 12) to children aged 2 - 14 years in endemic areas in\nAsia.55, level I\nPooled analysis of two RCTs showed the dengue vaccine was efficacious\nin children \u22659 years old against all severity dengue hospitalisation\n(80.8%, 95% CI 70.1 to 87.7). The result was not in favour of younger\nchildren. Analysis on long-term safety was not available then.56, level I\nFurther analysis of three RCTs demonstrated that the risk was higher\nfor hospitalisation in VCD (HR=1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.70) and severe\nVCD (HR=2.87, 95% CI 1.09 to 7.61) in vaccinated subjects compared\nwith control in seronegative 2 to 16 years old participants. The vaccine\nprevented hospitalisation in seropositive participants with HR of 0.32\n(95% CI 0.23 to 0.45) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.58) for VCD and\nsevere VCD subjects respectively. Thus, the vaccine was protective in\nthose who had exposure to dengue before vaccination.57, level I\n\u2022 More evidence is warranted especially on long-term safety profile\nbefore dengue vaccination can be recommended. 9.2 Prevention of Mosquito Bite\nPreventive measures on mosquito bite include the use of:3, level III\n\u2022 clothing that minimises skin exposure during daylight hours when\nmosquitoes are most active\n\u2022 repellents on exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with\nlabel instructions\n\u2022 insecticide-treated mosquito nets during sleeping\n\u2022 household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils or other\ninsecticide vaporisers\n\u2022 household fixtures e.g. window and door screens and airconditioning\nAlthough no evidence could be found to support the efficacy of repellent\nin reducing dengue incidence,58, level III experts advocate the use of\nrepellent.
