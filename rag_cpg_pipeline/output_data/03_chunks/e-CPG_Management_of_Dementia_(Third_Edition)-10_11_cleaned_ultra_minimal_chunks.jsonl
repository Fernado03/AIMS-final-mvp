Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every health care provider\nis responsible for the management of his/her unique patient based\non the clinical picture presented by the patient and the management\noptions available locally. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2021 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2025) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairperson of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed, and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

Risk Reduction\n\u2022 Risk reduction strategies should be advocated to reduce the risk of\ndeveloping cognitive decline and/or dementia. These include:\n\uf0a1 physical activity\n\uf0a1 tobacco cessation\n\uf0a1 interventions for alcohol use disorders\n\uf0a1 management of hypertension\n\uf0a1 management of diabetes\nAssessment and Diagnosis\n\u2022 The diagnosis of dementia should be based on detailed history and\nphysical examination, and supported by cognitive, functional and\nbehavioural evaluation. \u2022 Structural neuroimaging (computed tomography or magnetic\nresonance imaging) should be done in evaluation of dementia to\nexclude reversible causes of cognitive decline and other intracranial\npathology. \u2022 Electroencephalogram should be considered in rapidly progressive\ncognitive decline and atypical features of dementia. \u2022 Diagnosis of dementia should be made based on Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Non-Pharmacological Treatment\n\u2022 To improve cognitive function in mild to moderate dementia, cognitive\nstimulation therapy and physical activity should be offered. \u2022 In people with dementia having behavioural and psychological\nsymptoms:\n\uf0a1 explore and address possible clinical or environmental causes/\ntriggering factors\n\uf0a1 offer psychosocial and environmental interventions as initial and\nongoing treatment:\n- psychological intervention for depressive symptoms and/or\nanxiety\n- personalised and tailored activities for agitation and aggression\nManagement of Dementia (Third Edition)\nPharmacological Treatment\n\u2022 Donepezil should be offered in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) of all\nseverity. \uf0a1 Rivastigmine is an option in mild to moderate AD. \u2022 Memantine may be considered in moderate to severe AD as\nmonotherapy or in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\n(AChEI). \u2022 AChEI or memantine may be considered in vascular dementia. \u2022 Rivastigmine or donepezil may be considered for dementia with\nLewy body and Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia. \u2022 Antipsychotics may be considered for behavioural and psychological\nsymptoms in people with dementia (PWD) where there is a risk of\nharming themselves or others.", "chunk_order": 2}

Caregiver Support\n\u2022 Caregivers should be actively involved and supported in the\nmanagement of dementia. \uf0a1 This includes assessment of the burden of caregivers. Legal and Ethical Issues\n\u2022 If there is any doubt regarding people with dementia (PWD)\u2019s\ndecision-making capacity, a formal assessment of decision-making\ncapacity should be carried out. \u2022 A doctor should comply with a patient\u2019s unequivocal written directive\nto refuse a particular treatment if that decision was made while the\npatient had mental capacity. \u2022 PWD (particularly moderate to severe) should be assessed for their\ndriving ability if they still wish to drive. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\nPalliative and End-of-Life Care\n\u2022 Physical restraints should be avoided in dementia. \u2022 Advance care planning should be considered in the management of\ndementia once the diagnosis is established. Referral\n\u2022 All patients with suspected dementia should be referred to a geriatric\npsychiatrist/psychiatrist, geriatrician or neurologist for assessment,\ndiagnosis and management. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these Clinical\nPractice Guidelines (CPG) were from the Ministry of Health (MoH)\nand Ministry of Higher Education. There was active involvement of a\nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database\nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines\nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans,\n\u201call adults (19 plus years)\u201d, publication from year \u201c2009 to Current\u201d\nand English language. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved\nliterature and guidelines were searched and, experts in the field\ncontacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom 19 Nov 2018 to 26 Feb 2019. Literature searches were repeated\nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process\nallowing any relevant papers published before 31 January 2021 to be\nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after\nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.", "chunk_order": 3}

Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after\nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other CPGs on Dementia e.g.:\n\u2022 Dementia: assessment, management and support for people living\nwith dementia and their carers [National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence (NICE), 2018]\n\u2022 Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with\nDementia [National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC),\n2016]\n\u2022 Risk Reduction of Cognitive Decline and Dementia WHO Guidelines\n[World Health Organization (WHO), 2019]\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as\nreferences. A total of 14 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 26 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nManagement of Dementia (Third Edition)\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG was developed\nlargely based on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG\nCouncil MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nDementia is a syndrome in which cognitive function (i.e. ability to\nprocess thought) deteriorates progressively. It is not part of a normal\nageing process. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, calculation,\nlearning capacity, language, judgement, emotional control, social\nbehaviour, or motivation (refer to Appendix 3 on 10 Warning Signs\nof Dementia). However, consciousness is not affected. Dementia\ncan lead to disability and dependency among people with dementia\n(PWD). It is commonly associated with behavioural and psychological\nsymptoms which can lead to increased dependency on caregivers\nand subsequent nursing home admission. The lack of awareness and\nunderstanding of dementia can lead to stigmatisation and, delay in\ndiagnosis and care. The physical, psychological, social and economic\nimpact of dementia on caregivers, family and society is tremendous\nand often overlooked. There are estimated 50 million PWD worldwide and 60% of them live\nin low- or middle-income countries. There are nearly 10 million new\ncases every year.1 According to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International,\nthe estimated number of PWD in Malaysia was 123,000 in 2015.", "chunk_order": 8}

This\nnumber was projected to be 261,000 by 2030 and further increased\nto 590,000 by 2050.2 Based on the Malaysian National Health and\nMorbidity Survey 2018: Elderly Health, the overall prevalence of\nprobable dementia was 8.5% (95% CI 6.97 to 10.22).3\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the commonest type of dementia (60\n- 70%), followed by vascular dementia (VaD), mixed dementia,\nfrontotemporal dementia (FTD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB),\nParkinson\u2019s disease dementia (PDD) and others. People with AD often\npresent initially with gradual episodic memory impairment. However,\nin early-onset AD (less than 65 years old), patients may present with\nbehavioural (frontal), visual (posterior cortical atrophy) or language\n(logopenic) variants with relatively well-preserved memory until the\nlater stages of the disease.4 VaD is associated with cardiovascular\nrisk factors, and often present with impaired executive function, slowed\nprocessing speed and memory retrieval difficulties.5 Mixed dementia\nis a combination of two or more dementia types, most frequently AD\nwith vascular pathology.6 In cases of behavioural variant frontotemporal\ndementia, the early manifestations tend to be changes in the personality\nwith executive dysfunction prior to memory issues.7 People with DLB\noften experience fluctuating cognitive decline with prominent visual\nhallucinations and spontaneous motor parkinsonism. Dementia occurs\nat least a year after the onset of motor symptoms in people with PDD.8\nAs Malaysia is moving towards an ageing nation, the country must\nprepare itself to address health issues pertaining to the older people\nManagement of Dementia (Third Edition)\ne.g. non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including dementia. The\nsecond edition of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on Management\nof Dementia was published in 2009. Since then, diagnostic criteria on\ndementia have been revised and become more comprehensive. There\nhave been minor advancements in the treatment of PWD. These are\naddressed in the new edition of the CPG. Apart from that, new sections\non risk reduction strategies and special populations are added.

ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS\nThe evaluation of dementia should be targeted at patients who present\nwith memory complaints (by patients themselves and/or carer), have\nclinical suspicion of cognitive impairment or are at increased risk for\ndementia as well as elderly patients who have questionable mental\ncapacity.31 The evidence on routine screening for cognitive impairment\namong asymptomatic community-dwelling adults age 65 and older is\ninsufficient to determine the balance of its benefits and harms.32\nInitial assessment may be performed using various cognitive assessment\ntools. If dementia is suspected on clinical assessment, laboratory tests\nfor basic dementia screening should be performed that include full\nblood count, biochemistry tests (glucose, lipid, electrolytes, renal and\nliver function tests, and calcium level), thyroid function test and, serum\nvitamin B12 and folate levels, to exclude potentially reversible causes\nas shown in Table 2 and to identify risk factors for dementia.

MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which individuals\npresent with cognitive impairment but minimal impairment of\ninstrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Those with MCI/CIND have\ngreater risk of developing all types of dementia (RR=3.3, 95% CI 2.5\nto 4.5) compared with age-matched participants with no MCI after 2 - 5\nyears of follow-up.108\na. Diagnostic Criteria\nDSM-5 recognises the predementia stage of cognitive impairment. The condition, which has many features of MCI, is termed mild\nneurocognitive disorder. Mild neurocognitive disorder recognises subtle\nfeatures of cognitive impairment that are distinct from ageing but do not\nrepresent dementia.58\nb. Assessment Tools\nIt is important to have a baseline cognitive measurement on MMSE\nor any cognitive assessment tools for patients with MCI. Majority of\nthe tools available have cultural, religious or educational biases. Thus, the interpretation of the result is individually tailored to each\npatient. When initial assessment is normal, clinicians can proceed\nto neuropsychological test to confirm the diagnosis of MCI. If both\nassessments are normal, the subject is recognised as having subjective\nmemory complaints. c. Investigation\nIn MCI, the investigations required are similar as in dementia in order\nto rule out other conditions. Refer to Chapter 3 on Diagnosis and\nAssessment. d.

The\nrole of caregiver is a central and integral part of dementia management. Caregivers should be involved in the management of PWD from the\nbeginning.10 NICE recognises the important role of caregivers and\ndiscusses their involvement in the management of PWD in detail.42\n\u2022\nThe ZBI has good reliability and validity to assess burden of\ncaregivers for PWD.49\nA few interventions to reduce the burden/strain of caregivers have been\nstudied and are discussed below. a.

Recommendation 12\n\u2022\nCaregivers should be actively involved and supported in the\nmanagement of dementia. \uf0a1 This includes assessment of the burden of caregivers. There are various community health and support services that are\navailable in the country to assist PWD and their caregivers. Social and\nWelfare Department are involved in some of these services. Relevant\ninformation can be obtained from the Ministry of Women, Family and\nCommunity Development of Malaysia and related non-governmental\norganisations (NGOs). Stigmatisation, lack of awareness and perceived lack of credibility of\nhealth care workers are among factors that discourage caregivers from\nreaching out to available services and supports.126, level III\nHence, collaborative efforts should be made by the government\nand respective stakeholders, including the MoH, Social and Welfare\nDepartment and NGOs to provide better support and service for the\nPWDs in Malaysia.

The assessment should be properly documented in\nthe patient\u2019s notes. \u2022\nWhere appropriate, efforts should be taken to restore the patient\u2019s\ndecision-making capacity or encourage the PWD\u2019s involvement\nin the decision-making process. \u2022\nIf the Mental Health Act 2001 is used, Section 77 is applicable\nwhen obtaining consent. b. Advance directives\nAlthough there is no law in Malaysia to govern advance directives in\nrespect of healthcare matters, the common law right to refuse treatment\nis applicable.129, level III Making advance decisions can be immensely\nvaluable as it can help health care providers in Malaysia to understand\nbetter the preferences and wishes of their patients.130, level III PWD may\ndecide to make advance decisions regarding treatment while they still\npossess the mental capacity to do so by way of an advance directive\nor an advance care plan (Section 10d). Advance directives serve to\nguarantee the right of mentally competent individuals to continue\nexercising their autonomy in the event of future incapacity. These\ninclude the following:131\n\u2022\nA doctor should comply with a patient\u2019s unequivocal written\ndirective to refuse a particular treatment. \u2022\nDoctors are advised to consult the next of kin or seek legal advice\nif there is doubt on the validity of an advance directive, and these\ndiscussions need to be documented. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\nc. Fitness to drive\nDriving ability involves multiple cognitive domains and requires\nvisuospatial, executive function, memory, attention and motor skills. Other factors important in determining driving safety are vision,\nmobility, head-turning and day-time somnolence. In mild dementia,\nsome patients may retain the skills needed for driving. Patients with\nmoderate-severe dementia are unlikely to be fit to drive. Driving risk\nmay be greater in certain subtypes of dementia e.g. FTD (due to lack of\ncortical insight) and DLB (due to fluctuating consciousness and visual\nhallucinations).132, level III\nFor patients who decide to stop driving or who are forced to stop,\nclinicians must discuss practical alternatives, the impact on psychosocial\nbenefits and the loss of autonomy with patients and their\ncaregivers.132, level III\n\u2022\nAssessment of fitness to drive involves composite cognitive test\nbatteries in combination with other types of assessments e.g.", "chunk_order": 36}

However, if the PWD does not consent to the disclosure,\nmedical practitioners may still permissibly breach the confidentiality\nof the PWD utilising reasons for disclosure in the patient\u2019s medical\ninterests and/or disclosure in the public interest if they judge that doing\nso will provide important benefits to the patient or prevent serious harm\nto third parties.131 Such disclosures should be limited only to essential\ninformation for the intended purpose and only to those persons who\nneed to be notified.128\nRecommendation 13\n\u2022\nIf there is any doubt regarding people with dementia (PWD)\u2019s\ndecision-making capacity, a formal assessment of decision-making\ncapacity should be carried out. \u2022\nA doctor should comply with a patient\u2019s unequivocal written directive\nto refuse a particular treatment if that decision was made while the\npatient had mental capacity. \u2022\nPWD (particularly moderate to severe) should be assessed for their\ndriving ability if they still wish to drive. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\n10. PALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CARE\nThere has been no major breakthrough in curative treatment for\ndementia over the past few decades. As dementia is a progressive\nand irreversible illness which can affect the QoL for PWD and their\ncaregivers, palliative care should be initiated at the time of diagnosis\nthroughout different stages of illness. As the disease progressed and\nthe PWD become more dependent, the palliative care components\nshould be more emphasised in their management to achieve the best\nquality of life. Continuous communication with the PWD and caregivers is important\nto assist them to establish the advance care planning especially during\nearly stage of disease where the PWD are still capable to make their\nown decision. Education, spiritual and psychological support should be\noffered to improve QoL and reduce burden of the caregivers. Evidence for best practice during end-of-life care for PWD is limited and\nheterogenous.", "chunk_order": 37}

Evidence for best practice during end-of-life care for PWD is limited and\nheterogenous. Nevertheless, best supportive care should be offered\nto them based on their preference and the principles of basic medical\nethics. a. Artificial nutrition and hydration\nDysphagia is a common problem in advance dementia. In a systematic\nreview, dysphagia diagnostic assessment e.g. clinical swallowing\nexamination, video fluoroscopy swallowing study and flexible\nendoscopic examination of swallowing can be used to determine the\ntype of deficits in oropharyngeal dysphagia. However, there was limited\nevidence on the benefits of postural change, diet and liquid modification,\nand medication in management of this condition.136, level I\nIn another systematic review, there was moderate quality of evidence\non the use of high-calorie supplements to improve weight gain in person\nwith advance dementia and not on function and survival.137, level I There\nwas limited evidence to show that enteral tube feeding may prolong the\nsurvival rate and reduce aspiration pneumonia in advanced dementia\nbased on a systematic review. On the other hand, percutaneous\nenterogastrostomy tube was associated with increased risk of pressure\nulcer development or aggravation.138, level I\nNICE does not recommend routine use of enteral feeding in people\nwith severe dementia, unless indicated for a potentially reversible comorbidity.42\n\u2022\nThere was insufficient evidence to recommend enteral feeding in\npatients with severe dementia. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\nb. Pain management\nPain is another prevalent and distressing issue for person with\nadvance dementia. However, the affected person is not able to express\nthemselves accurately on the pain they experience and very often it is\nmanifested as behavioural problems. An RCT examining on the impact of a stepwise protocol for treating\npain on PWD in nursing home showed that pain medication significantly\nimproved pain control in the intervention group.139, level I However a\nsystematic review showed that evidence on pain management for\nadvance dementia was limited and heterogenous. Despite increased\nuse of analgesia, pain was still prevalent in PWD.140, level I\nc. Restraints\nRestraints are used to protect people with severe dementia from\nharming themselves. These can be physical, chemical or psychological\nrestraints. A multinational cohort study on PWD in nursing homes showed that\nphysical restraint was associated with a higher risk of both functional\n(RR=2.30, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.49) and cognitive decline (RR=1.93, 95%\nCI 1.44 to 2.58) compared with AP alone.", "chunk_order": 38}

Advance care planning\nEvery PWD has the right to plan ahead for their future when they still\nhave the capability to make decision. Hence, advance care planning\nshould be discussed with PWD and their family members as early\nas possible after the diagnosis is established. The discussion should\ninclude lasting power of attorney (for decisions unrelated to healthcare\nas permitted under the Power of Attorney Act 1949) and future medical\ncare direction based on their own preference, value and goals of life. PWD and their family members are allowed to review and change any\nadvance statements they have made as the disease progresses.42\nA systematic review showed that intervention with advance care\nplanning significantly reduced inappropriate hospital admissions\nand healthcare costs for PWD compared with control group.143, level I\nTherefore, attending clinicians should actively offer advance care\nplanning to PWD and their family members when they are ready for it. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\nRefer to Appendix 13 on Advance Care Planning for more details. Recommendation 14\n\u2022\nPhysical restraints should be avoided in dementia. \u2022\nAdvance care planning should be considered in the management of\ndementia once the diagnosis is established. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\n11. REFERRAL\nPatients suspected of dementia should be referred to specialist care\ncentres (e.g. geriatrics/psychiatry/neurology) for confirmation of\ndiagnosis and management of complexities. This is because of the need\nfor comprehensive assessments and investigations. At the moment,\nmedication for dementia is not available at primary care locally. Once a diagnosis is made, stable PWD can be co-managed in both\nprimary and secondary/tertiary care as an integrated care system. Management aspect than can be offered in primary care include\nmanagement of medical co-morbidities and non-pharmacological\ntreatment (e.g. cognitive stimulation and designing meaningful\nactivities). However, these cases should be referred back to secondary/\ntertiary care when there is difficult behaviour problem, psychiatric comorbidity, rapid deterioration in clinical condition, etc. Recommendation 15\n\u2022\nAll patients with suspected dementia should be referred to a geriatric\npsychiatrist/psychiatrist, geriatrician or neurologist for assessment,\ndiagnosis and management\nManagement of Dementia (Third Edition)\n12.", "chunk_order": 39}

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of dementia should be guided by an evidence-based\napproach, in order to provide quality care to the PWD. Several factors\nmay affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 12.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022\nwide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to health\ncare providers\n\u2022\ntraining and updates in relation to dementia\n\u2022\npublic awareness campaigns related to cognitive impairment\nincluding dementia\n\u2022\ninter-ministerial\ncollaboration\nand\ninvolvement\nof\nnongovernmental organisations to support the PWD and their\ncaregivers\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:\n\u2022\nlimited exposure and training among health care providers on\nmanagement of dementia\n\u2022\nvariation in availability of expertise and access to service\nprovision\n\u2022\nlack of awareness among patients, families, community and\nhealth care workers\n\u2022\nlack of local data on dementia, e.g. research, registry, etc., for\nplanning on services\n12.2 Potential Resource Implications\nIn local setting, dementia is very much underdiagnosed due to lack of\nawareness and misconception that it is normal part of ageing among\nthe public and health care providers. Besides that, PWD always present\nlate with behavioural issues. In terms of pharmacotherapy, AChEI is strongly recommended in the\ntreatment of dementia. However, it is not readily available in the primary/\nsecondary/tertiary care due to financial constraints. Apart from that,\nmany non-pharmacological interventions may not be easily available\ndue to lack of manpower/expertise to conduct it. The CPG recommends early detection and referral, comprehensive\nassessment and treatment of the disorder. This requires increased\nawareness among public, caregivers and health care providers to\nestablish diagnosis and early intervention to PWD as well as support\nto the caregivers. Management of Dementia (Third Edition)\nThus, the implementation of this CPG requires resources to provide:\n\u2022\ntraining of health care providers and caregivers\n\u2022\nbetter access to referral centres\n\u2022\nbetter caregiver support network\n\u2022\naccess to policy makers e.g. National Dementia Action Plan\nBased on the key recommendations, the following are proposed as\nclinical audit indicators for quality management of dementia:\n*geriatric psychiatrist/psychiatrist, geriatrician or neurologist\n**all severity\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of\nthe CPG by MoH which include launching of the CPG, Quick Reference\nand Training Module.", "chunk_order": 40}

This\nsyndrome occurs in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in cerebrovascular disease\nand in other conditions primarily or secondarily affecting the brain. In assessing the presence or absence of dementia, special care should\nbe taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional\nfactors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and\ngeneral physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may\naccount for failure to perform. Dementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning\nand usually some interference with personal activities of daily living,\nsuch as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and\ntoilet activities. How such a decline manifests itself will depend largely\non the social and cultural setting in which the patient lives. Changes in\nrole performance, such as lowered ability to keep or find a job, should\nnot be used as criteria for dementia because of the large cross-cultural\ndifferences that exist in what is appropriate and because there may be\nfrequent, externally imposed changes in the availability of work within\na particular culture. If depressive symptoms are present but the criteria for depressive\nepisode (F32.0-F32.3) are not fulfilled, they can be recorded by means\nof a fifth character.

Generally unaware\nof their surroundings, the year, the season,\netc. May have difficulty counting from 10,\nboth backward and sometimes forward. Will\nrequire some assistance with activities of\ndaily living, e.g. may become incontinent, will\nrequire travel assistance but occasionally will\nbe able to travel to familiar locations. Diurnal\nrhythm frequently disturbed. Almost always\nrecall their own name. Frequently continue to\nbe able to distinguish familiar from unfamiliar\npersons in their environment. Personality\nand emotional changes occur. These are\nquite variable and include: (a) delusional\nbehaviour, e.g. patients may accuse their\nspouse of being an impostor, may talk to\nimaginary figures in the environment or\nto their own reflection in the mirror; (b)\nobsessive symptoms, e.g. person may\ncontinually repeat simple cleaning activities;\n(c) anxiety symptoms, agitation and even\npreviously non-existent violent behaviour\nmay occur; (d) cognitive abulia, i.e. loss\nof willpower because an individual cannot\ncarry a thought long enough to determine a\npurposeful course of action. All verbal abilities are lost over the course\nof this stage. Frequently there is no speech\nat all, only unintelligible utterances and rare\nemergence of seemingly forgotten words\nand phrases. Incontinent of urine, requires\nassistance toileting and feeding. Basic\npsychomotor skills, e.g., ability to walk, are\nlost with the progression of this stage.
