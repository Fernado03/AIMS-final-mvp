Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were issued in 2015 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2019) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

The inclusion criteria\nare all literature on multiple sclerosis regardless of study design. The\nsearch was limited to literature published in the last 15 years, humans\nand English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts\nin the field were also contacted to identify relevant studies. In certain\nsituations, pivotal papers beyond the scope of search were used in the\nCPG. All searches were conducted from 30 January 2013 to 13 August\n2014. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at\nthe end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers\npublished before 28 February 2015 to be included. In view of evolving\nissues on it, pivotal papers on diagnostic criterias after February 2015\nwere accessed. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published\nafter this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to a CPG on multiple sclerosis developed\nby the National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions in 2004\nand National Clinical Guideline Centre in 2014 [commissioned by\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)]. The CPG\nwas evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. A total of 23 clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions)\nThe DG members met 24 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC.

INTRODUCTION\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) and other idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating\ndisorders (IIDDs) especially neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\n(NMOSD) have an increasing importance in terms of diagnosis and\ntreatment in Malaysia. MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of\nthe central nervous system (CNS) with heterogeneous presentations. It can be considered a two phase disease made up of the early\npredominantly inflammatory phase wherein relapses are common and\na later more progressive neurodegenerative phase characterised by\naxonal loss. It is important to diagnose MS during the early inflammatory phase. It is during this phase that disease modifying therapy (DMT) prevents\nrelapses and may delay the disability and progression of disease. Initiation of early treatment in MS poses many challenges and with\nthe recent increase in DMTs, the treatment should be individualised.", "chunk_order": 5}

It is during this phase that disease modifying therapy (DMT) prevents\nrelapses and may delay the disability and progression of disease. Initiation of early treatment in MS poses many challenges and with\nthe recent increase in DMTs, the treatment should be individualised. As MS patients also experience diverse symptoms and disabilities, a\nmultidisciplinary approach is ideal. In Malaysia, the first point of contact for patients with symptoms\nsuggestive of established MS or high risk for MS is the primary and\nsecondary healthcare providers. Neurologists have an important role\nin confirming the diagnosis, ruling out NMOSD and initiating DMT in\nMS. To date, there have not been any local guidelines to aid in the\nmanagement of MS. Hence, this CPG on Management of MS is timely,\nevidence-based and applicable to the local context at all levels of health\ncare. 2. EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe total number of patients with MS worldwide is estimated to be 2 -\n2.5 million. The prevalence is >100 - 200/100,000 in temperate areas\nlike United States of America, Canada, New Zealand and parts of\nAustralia. It is <5 per 100,000 in tropical areas or Asia.1, level III\nIn Asia, the prevalence of MS is reported to be 1 - 2/100,000 in China\nand 7.7/100,000 in Japan.2 - 3, level III The prevalence of MS in Malaysia\nis estimated to range from 2 to 3/100,000.3 - 4, level III However, the patient\npopulation included in these studies were a mixed group of both MS\nand NMOSD. In the 1980s, the prevalence of MS in India was crudely\nestimated to be 1/100,000 but a recent study suggested the age\nadjusted prevalence had increased to 7.8/100,000.5, level III\nWorldwide, MS is commonest among women in their 20s to 40s. It is\ncommoner among whites and the female to male ratio varies from 2:1\nManagement of Multiple Sclerosis\n2\nto 3.8.3, level III A study at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital showed a female to\nmale ratio of 5:1 for MS. The mean age at onset was 28.6\u00b19.9 years with\na mean duration of illness of 6.4\u00b15.2 years. Malay was the predominant\nracial group affected (52.9%), followed by the Indian (26.9%), Chinese\n(18.3%), and indigenous groups from East Malaysia (1.9%). Ratios of\nMS to NMOSD in different racial groups in Malaysia also differs i.e. Malays 38:55 (41% NMOSD), Chinese 32:19 (63% NMOSD) and\nIndians 7:28 (20% NMOSD).6, level III\nManagement of Multiple Sclerosis\n3\n3. RISK FACTORS\nThe aetiology of MS is multifactorial involving both genetic and\nenvironmental factors. The disease is triggered by an autoimmune\nprocess in susceptible individuals.

RISK FACTORS\nThe aetiology of MS is multifactorial involving both genetic and\nenvironmental factors. The disease is triggered by an autoimmune\nprocess in susceptible individuals. The risk factors can be categorised\nas the following:\na. Genetics\n\u2022 The risk of MS in offspring of single affected parent is 2% and\nhigher in those of conjugal pairs with MS (20%).7, level III Maternal\nhalf-siblings of MS patients have twice the risk compared with\npaternal half-siblings.1, level III\n\u2022 First degree relatives have a 10 - 25 times greater risk of\ndeveloping MS than the general population.8, level III\n\u2022 Twin studies have shown genetic susceptibility with concordance\nrates of 25 - 30%.1, level III\n\u2022 The commonest genetic risk factor is Human Leucocyte Antigen\nallele DRB1*1501.1, level III\nb. Ethnicity\n\u2022 Caucasians from Scandinavia and Scotland are extremely\nsusceptible to MS. However, it is rare in the Mongolian race,\nChinese and others.1, level III\nc. Sex\n\u2022 MS is more common in women than men.8, level III\nd. Migration and latitude\n\u2022 Migrants moving from an area where MS is common to an area\nwhere it is less common show a decrease in the rate of MS, while\nmigrants moving in the opposite direction tend to retain the low\nrisk of MS as of their country of origin. Studies have shown that\npeople born in an area with a high risk of MS who then migrated\nto an area with a lower risk before the age of 15 assumed the risk\nof their new area suggesting the effect of an environmental agent\nbefore puberty.1, level III\n\u2022 Within regions of temperate climate, MS prevalence generally\nincreases with latitude.8, level III\ne. Environmental factors associated with increased risk of MS are:\n\u2022 lack of sunlight exposure1, level III and ultraviolet radiation9, level III\n\u2022 low serum level of 25 Hydroxycholecalciferol10, level II-2\n\u2022 Epstein-Barr Virus infection11, level II-2\n\u2022 smoking12, level II-2\n\u2022 Risk factors for MS are:\n\uf0a1 genetics\n\uf0a1 ethnicity\n\uf0a1 sex\n\uf0a1 migration and latitude\n\uf0a1 environmental factors\nManagement of Multiple Sclerosis\n4\n4. PATHOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY\nMS is believed to be an autoimmune disease. The pathological hallmark\nof MS is the presence of multiple discrete areas of myelin loss within\nthe CNS with predilection for the optic nerves, spinal cord, brainstem,\ncerebellum, juxtacortical,subcortical and periventricular white matter\nregions as well as the cortical grey matter.

The pathological hallmark\nof MS is the presence of multiple discrete areas of myelin loss within\nthe CNS with predilection for the optic nerves, spinal cord, brainstem,\ncerebellum, juxtacortical,subcortical and periventricular white matter\nregions as well as the cortical grey matter. The affected areas are\ncalled plaques or lesions.13, level III\nEarly MS demyelination is accompanied by inflammation and relative\naxonal preservation though axon loss also occurs. The lesions\nevolve differently during the early as opposed to the later stage of\nthe disease. Within each phase, different plaques in different stages\nof demyelinating activity are evident. Histologically, inflammation,\nmyelin breakdown, astrogliosis, olidendrocyte injury, axonal loss and\nremyelination are seen.13, level III In progressive MS, increasing axonal\nloss, neurodegeneration and failure of remyelination all play an\nimportant role.14, level III\nMS is an immune mediated disease. Autoreactive T and B cells are\nactivated in the periphery and trans-migrate to the blood brain barrier\n(BBB) triggering an autoimmune cascade which leads to damage of\nthe myelin sheath and axons directly within the CNS.

NATURAL HISTORY\nThe overall course of MS can be classified into the following categories:\na. Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)64, level II-2; 65, level III\n\u2022 This is defined as acute worsening of neurological function\nfollowed by a variable degree of recovery, with a stable course\nbetween attacks. \u2022 Approximately 85% of patients initially fall into this category. b. Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS)64, level II-2; 65, level III\n\u2022 It is defined by an initial relapsing-remitting disease course,\nfollowed by gradual progression with or without relapses and\nplateaus. \u2022 Estimated median time to secondary progressive onset is 15\nyears. \u2022 More than 80% of patients develop secondary course after 25\nyears from onset of RRMS. c. Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)21, level III; 65, level III\n\u2022 This refers to a gradual, nearly continuous worsening baseline\nwith minor fluctuations but no distinct relapses. \u2022 It affects 10 to 20% of patients. d. Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS)21, level III; 65, level III\n\u2022 This is defined as progressive disease from onset, with subsequent\nrelapses, with or without full recovery. The periods between\nrelapses are characterised by continuing disease progression. \u2022 It affects less than 5% of individuals with MS. The following figure illustrates the four categories of MS mentioned\nabove:\nFigure 4. Categories of MS\nSource: Diagnosis, Treatments, and Prognosis in MS: A Nursing Perspective.

Benign MS\n\u2022 Patient with minimal (EDSS \u22643.0) or no disability 10 to 15 years\nafter disease onset. b. Malignant MS\n\u2022 Rapid and progressive course of illness, leading to significant\ndisability in multiple neurological systems or death in a relatively\nshort time after disease onset. Estimated median time from disease onset to EDSS 3, 6, 8 and 10 are\n10, 18, 28 and 63 years respectively. The second attack usually occurs\nafter a median of two years. The median interval from onset to EDSS 3\nis approximately eight years.64, level II-2 Refer to Appendix 6 on Kurtzke\nExpanded Disability Status Scale. The factors associated with a higher conversion rate to SPMS are:64, level II-2\n\u2022 short first inter-attack interval\n\u2022 more relapses in the first two years\nThis emphasises the importance of early initiation of disease modifying\ntreatment (DMT). In 2011, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of\nMS re-examined the MS disease phenotypes and revised its clinical\ndescriptions of relapsing and progressive MS. While retaining core\nfeatures above, it included assessment of disease activity based on\nclinical relapses, imaging findings and disease progression as the 2013\nrevisions.The progressive relapsing category was eliminated and it is\nnow called primary progressive MS with disease activity. CIS is now\nincluded under the spectrum of MS.67, level III Refer to Appendix 5. Management of Multiple Sclerosis\n22\n9. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA\nThe currently accepted criteria for MS diagnosis are the Mc Donalds\ndiagnostic criteria. The criteria includes clinical and paraclinical\nlaboratory investigations. The criteria emphasise the need to demonstrate\nDIS and DIT, and to exclude alternative diagnoses. Refer to Appendix\n7 for MRI Brain Criteria on DIS and DIT. These criteria have resulted in an earlier diagnosis of RRMS with\nmoderate sensitivity and specificity. The current revision of the McDonald\ncriteria in 2010 also reinforces the importance of excluding other IIDDs\nsuch as NMOSD by doing anti-AQP4 Ab testing with validated assays. Diagnosis of CDMS requires evidence of \u22652 attacks with objective\nclinical evidence of \u22652 lesions on examination. However, objective\nclinical evidence of one lesion, corroborated by reasonable historical\nevidence of a prior attack may also be used. If the above definition for CDMS is only partially fulfilled, the diagnosis\ncan still be made by using McDonald criteria 2010 on MRI for\ndissemination in space and time. The current criteria also provides for\nthe diagnosis of PPMS. Refer to Table 5 and Table 6. Table 5.", "chunk_order": 21}

INVESTIGATIONS\nThe mainstay of investigations in patients with MS is neuroimaging;\nMRI is supported in certain situations by paraclinical tests and other\ninvestigations to rule out potential differential diagnoses (refer to\nSection on Differential Diagnoses, tailoring investigations according to\nclinical suspicion). 10.1 Neuroimaging\nSince 2001, brain MRI has been included in the evaluation of patients\nwith suspected MS by demonstrating dissemination of disease in\nspace (DIS) and time (DIT).71, level III It assists in earlier diagnosis of\nMS by enabling visualisation of lesions in the brain that are clinically\nsilent. However, a diagnosis of MS should not be made simply on the\nbasis of MRI findings without the appropriate clinical history, signs and\nsymptoms.72, level III\nTo date, there have been a number of revisions to the McDonald\ncriteria (refer to Appendix 7.

Clinical relapses\nNatural history studies have shown a modest correlation between the\noccurrence of relapses in the first few years (2 - 5 years) of disease\nonset and the risk of disability, progression to EDSS 6.0 and onset of\nsecondary progressive MS. Later in the disease course, the association\nbetween relapses and progression is not as strong.64, level II-2; 86 - 87, level II-2\nb. Measuring progression\nProgression in MS is the term used to define steady worsening of\nsymptoms and signs over 6 - 12 months. The date at which progression\nstarts is assigned retrospectively, once the required 6 - 12 months\nduration of continuous neurological worsening is confirmed. Disease\nprogression in MS can be monitored clinically using the EDSS. Kurtzke\u2019s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the gold\nstandard for grading clinical impairment and disability in MS. EDSS is\nan ordinal and categorical assessment (refer to Appendix 6). Time to\nreach a selected level of EDSS is the best means to measure disease\nprogression.7, level III; 21, level III Refer to Figure 5 on EDSS. Figure 5.

No uniform guidelines exist to direct the stopping of\na DMT before trying to become pregnant. Pregnancy counselling and\nplanned withdrawal of DMT is usually discussed with women with MS in\nadvance. The risks of teratogenicity and pregnancy losses are usually\nbalanced with an open discussion on the time frame of DMT withdrawal\nand when the patient should start to try conceiving. For DMT like IFN\u03b2,\nGA and DMF one month is sufficient for withdrawal of therapy prior to\ntry conceiving and two months for fingolimod. Although three months\nhave been recommended for natalizumab, it may be that one month is\nManagement of Multiple Sclerosis\n76\nsufficient. Teriflunomide should always be washed out prior to planned\nconception.272, level III In the event of unexpected pregnancy, treatment\ninterruption is advisable and patient is closely followed up. Refer to\nAppendix 9. Symptomatic therapies should be evaluated for potential teratogenic\nrisks and thus minimised in pregnant MS patients. Only those absolutely\nnecessary are used at the minimum effective dose. Alternative nonpharmacological strategies are encouraged. \u2022 Pregnancy Outcome\nA recent meta-analysis showed that there was a relatively higher\nprevalence of abortions, caesarean sections, prematurity and low\nbirth-weight babies among women with MS. However, these rates did\nnot reach levels that would signify great concern.275, level II-2 Therefore\npatients can be advised that MS has no negative impact on pregnancy\nand its outcomes. \u2022 Post-partum Issues\ni. Delivery Issues\nMS has no impact on the mode of delivery and the choice of anaesthesia\nin pregnancy.272, level III\nii. Breastfeeding\nDMT is not advisable during lactation. Two meta-analyses showed that\nbreastfeeding significantly prevented postpartum relapses although the\nfindings were limited by heterogeneity, methodological issues and small\nstudies.280 - 281, level II-2\niii. Restart Therapy\nDMT can be started immediately postpartum as long as the patient is\nnot breast-feeding.272, level III\n\u2022 Contraception\nThere is no evidence that oestrogen at doses contained in the combined\noral contraceptive pill (OCP) has an adverse effect on MS. Some drugs\nused in treating MS symptoms such as carbamazepine may decrease\nthe effectiveness of OCP. MS patients with decreased mobility should be\nwarned about the risk of thrombosis with OCPs. Therefore, alternative\nmethods of birth control should be discussed.273 - 274, level III\nManagement of Multiple Sclerosis\n77\nRecommendation 40\n\u2022 Pre-pregnancy counselling should be given to women with multiple\nsclerosis (MS) in the childbearing age. \u2022 Steroids should be avoided in the first trimester of pregnancy of MS\npatients; however the benefit and risk need to be carefully assessed. Methylprednisolone may be offered to MS patients with acute\nrelapse in second and third trimesters. \u2022 Disease Modifying Therapy should not be used in MS patients who\nare pregnant or breast-feeding. 15.2 Anaesthesia\nCurrently, there is lack of evidence on the effect of anaesthesia in MS\npatients.", "chunk_order": 66}

Therefore, general principles on the use of anaesthesia should\nbe applied pre-, intra- and post-operatively. DMT used in MS needs to\nbe reviewed during pre-operative anaesthetic consultation. There is no\nevidence to suggest one route (spinal, epidural or general anaesthesia)\nor any particular agent of anaesthesia is preferable or may lead to MS\nexacerbation.282, level III\n15.3 Immunisation\nTetanus 283, level II-2 and Hepatitis B vaccines 284, level II-2 do not increase\nrisk of developing MS. Hepatitis B, influenza, tetanus and diphtheriatetanus/diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines do not increase the risk\nof relapse of MS.285, level II-2 No evidence is available for other vaccines. Caution needs to be exercised in patients on fingolimod, natalizumab\nand mitoxantrone when considering the use of live attenuated vaccines. Management of Multiple Sclerosis\n78\n16. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nIt is important to standardise the management of MS at all healthcare\nlevels in Malaysia by using an evidence-based CPG. This aims to\nprevent long-term morbidity and mortality. 16.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\ni. wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies\nand softcopies)\nii. regular MS update for healthcare providers\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG are:\ni. poor understanding/limited knowledge of MS issues among patients/\ncarers and healthcare providers\nii. insufficient resources in the management of MS particularly in the\nexpertise (doctors and allied health) and diagnostic tools\niii. variation in treatment practice and preferences\niv. lack of active involvement of government and non-governmental\norganisations\nv. lack of co-ordinated referral and follow-up system\n16.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:\ni. ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare providers\nii. initiate training (with adequate funding) of healthcare providers\nensuring information is up-to-date\niii. ensure availability of highly specialised diagnostic tools and trained\nmanpower in MS management including multidisciplinary team at\ndifferent levels of healthcare\niv. ensure availability of drugs to treat MS\nv. ensure widespread distribution of updated patient education materials\nTo assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following is proposed as\nclinical audit indicator for quality management:-\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of\nthe CPG by MoH. They are such as a Quick Reference and a Training\nModule.
