The Review Committee was\nactively involved in the development process of these guidelines. The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Unerupted Maxillary\nIncisor (August 2006) was used as the basis for the development of\nthis CPG. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. In addition to the general text and photographic updates, new and\nupdated information has been included in the management such as the\nuse of Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), updates in surgical\nand restorative components, key messages and recommendations. In addition, clinical audit indicators have also been identified for the\npurpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes. As part of the reviewing process, new evidences were retrieved\nfrom publications from year 2006 to June 2015. Literature search\nwas carried out using the following electronic databases: PUBMED/\nMEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); ISI\nWeb of Knowledge; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and full\ntext journal articles via OVID search engine. The reference lists of\nall relevant articles retrieved were also searched to identify further\nstudies.

The reference lists of\nall relevant articles retrieved were also searched to identify further\nstudies. Free text terms or MeSH terms were used either singly or in\ncombination to retrieve the articles (Appendix 1). Only literature in\nEnglish was retrieved. There were 14 clinical questions assigned to members of the\ndevelopment group. The group members met a total of seven times\nthroughout the development of this CPG. Literature retrieved were\nappraised by at least two members and presented in the form of\nevidence table and discussed during group meetings. All statements\nand recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the\ndevelopment group and review committee. This CPG is based largely\non scientific evidences and adapted according to local practices. However, where there was a lack of evidence, recommendations were\nbased on consensus of group members. Although, ideally patients\u2019\nManagement of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor\n2015\nviews and preferences need to be considered in the development\nof CPGs, in this instance, it was not feasible. Nevertheless, patient\ninformation leaflets would be developed to facilitate the dissemination\nof important information to the public. The levels of evidence of the literature were graded using the modified\nversion from the United States (U.S) / Canadian Preventive Services\nTask Force, while the grading of recommendations was based on the\nmodified version of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\n(SIGN). The draft guidelines were evaluated by a team of reviewers and were also\nposted on the Ministry of Health, Malaysia and Academy of Medicine,\nMalaysia websites for comments and feedbacks. This guideline was\npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, and finally\nto the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and CPG Council, Ministry\nof Health, Malaysia for approval. GENERAL OBJECTIVE\nTo enable clinicians to make informed decisions in the detection and\nmanagement of unerupted maxillary incisors. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\n1.

DIAGNOSIS\n2.1 Dental and Medical History\nA detailed dental and medical history should be obtained to determine\npossible aetiology, which may cause delayed eruption. Medical and\ndental history should include:\n\u2022 Family medical history (any syndromic tendencies)\n\u2022 History of trauma and extraction\n2.2 Examination and Diagnosis\nEarly clinical examination with radiographic investigation at age of 6-8\nyears can detect presence of unerupted maxillary incisors, 3, level III which\nwould allow early interception and monitoring and thus may improve\ntreatment outcome. 2.2.1 Clinical Examination\nAn intra-oral examination should be conducted for the presence of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Retained deciduous teeth (Figure 2)\n\u2022 Buccal or palatal swelling\n\u2022 Availability of space for the incisor (about 9 mm for a central\nincisor and about 7 mm for lateral incisors) 19, level III\nFigure 2: Unerupted maxillary right and left central incisors\n(Photo credit: Roslili Mat)\nManagement of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor\n2015\n2.2.2 Radiographic Investigations\nThe following radiographs may aid in the diagnosis and management:\n\u2022 An anterior occlusal radiograph for general assessment\npurposes 20, level III\n\u2022 Two periapical radiographs should be taken using the parallax\ntechnique for detailed assessment of the position, root and\ncrown morphology. 21-22, level III It has been shown that the\nuse of horizontal parallax technique is better than vertical\nparallax in localization of impacted canines 23, level II-3\n\u2022 If an anterior occlusal and a panoramic radiograph are already\navailable, the vertical parallax can also be used for assessment\n20, level III\n2.2.3 Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)\nIn recent years CBCT has been introduced as a technique for imaging\nof dental and maxillofacial structures. 24, level III CBCT is a medical image\nacquisition technique based on a cone-shaped X-ray beam centred on\na two-dimensional (2D) detector. The source-detector system performs\none rotation around the object producing a series of 2D images. The\nimages are reconstructed in a three-dimensional (3D) data set using a\nmodification of the original cone-beam algorithm. 25, level III\nCBCT imaging provides orthodontists with an excellent tool to improve\ndiagnosis, treatment planning and outcome assessment in appropriate\nmalocclusion cases.", "chunk_order": 6}

Two basic approaches are open and closed eruption techniques. 4.3.1.1 Open Eruption Technique\nThe impacted tooth is left exposed to the oral environment following\nsurgery and surrounded by the incised palatal or labial mucosa. An attachment may be placed during or after the procedure. This\ntechnique is termed open eruption technique or exposure and can be\nperformed in two ways:\na) The window technique\nThis direct technique involves removal of the overlying mucosa\nand the exposed tooth will have a non-keratinized labial\ngingival mucosa. Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor\n2015\nb) The apically repositioned flap\nThe procedure involves apically repositioning the raised flap\nthat incorporates attached gingiva overlying the impacted\ntooth and is expected to provide adequate width of attached\ngingiva. 4.3.1.2 Closed Eruption Technique\nThe closed eruption technique has been favoured by many clinicians\nwho claimed that the aesthetic and periodontal outcome is far more\nsuperior when compared with the apically positioned flap. 55, level II-2\nWith this method, a labial or palatal flap is raised and an attachment\nwith gold chain or a bracket/eyelet with ligature wire is bonded to the\nenamel surface of the tooth using acid-etch technique, preferably\nwith a light cured adhesive, before the flap is replaced (Figure 5).

A simple window technique\nmay be preferred if the impacted tooth is low down in the alveolus\nand bucco lingually close to its place in the arch. For palatally positioned tooth where there is presence of thick\npalatal mucosa tissue the window technique usually requires\nFigure 5:\nExposure and placement of orthodontic\nattachment\nusing\nclosed\ntechnique\n(Photo credit: Norhayati Hassan)\nManagement of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor\n2015\nplacement of a periodontal pack to prevent regrowth of tissue\nover the exposed tooth. \u2022\nVertical position of the unerupted tooth relative to the\nmucogingival junction\nIf the crown of the unerupted tooth is positioned coronal to\nmucogingival junction any one of the three techniques can be\nused to uncover the tooth. If it is positioned apical to the\nmucogingival junction, the window technique may not be\nappropriate and the apically position technique is appropriate. To uncover the tooth that is significantly apical to the mucogingival\njunction, a close eruption technique is preferred. \u2022\nThe amount of gingiva in the area of the unerupted tooth\nIn the presence of insufficient gingiva in the area of the unerupted\ntooth, an apically positioned flap is preferred. 2 - 3 mm of attached\ngingiva over the crown of the tooth allows any of the three\ntechnique to be used. \u2022\nThe mesio-distal position of the crown of the tooth\nIf the central incisor is positioned over the root of the lateral incisor\nit would be difficult to move the tooth through the alveolus, unless\ncompletely exposed with apically positioned flap.

Whilst\nthe acrylic component may aesthetically and functionally replace\nand/or mask supporting tissue defect, the rigid alloy framework\nmay offer stabilisation of the arch following orthodontic treatment\nand thus, may allow re-establishment of occlusal stability. 92, level III\nManagement of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor\n2015\nd)\nRestore space with implant\nAn implant (Figure 7) may be considered for adolescents\nprovided that dental and skeletal maturation is complete or\nalmost complete. 93, level II-2 Good survival rates, aesthetics, safety,\nefficacy and highly predictable results with different implant\nsystems provided strict protocols and case selection is adhered\nto. 94, level III; 95-96, level II-2 Infraocclusion of the implant-supported crown\nmay occur due to slight continuous eruption of the adjacent teeth\npost-adolescent.

Inadequate clearance may necessitate soft or hard\ncrestal tissue to be removed, although ideally the opposing\nteeth should be orthodontically intruded beforehand. 80, level III The\ncoronal mesio-distal restorative space required is determined\nfrom the diagnostic wax up or from the presence of contralateral\ntooth or space. These factors should be taken into account at the\ntreatment planning stage.

Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor\n2015\n5. CONCLUSION\nUnerupted maxillary incisors should be identified early and managed\naccordingly based on a comprehensive clinical examination and\nradiographic investigation. Depending on the position and prognosis of\nthe tooth, appropriate treatment plan with multidisciplinary involvement\nshould be carried out. 6. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the\nmanagement of unerupted maxillary incisors in Malaysia. Limiting Factors in Implementation\nPotential limiting factors in the implementation of CPG are as follows:\na)\nPoor understanding/limited knowledge on unerupted maxillary\nincisor among patients/caregivers and healthcare providers\nb)\nInsufficient resources, lack of expertise in the management of\nunerupted maxillary incisor and diagnostic tools\nc)\nVariation in treatment practice and preferences\nd)\nLack of coordinated referral and follow-up system\nMethods to Facilitate Implementation\nIt is hoped that implementation of the CPG recommendations would\nbe effective through:\na)\ndissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers\nb)\nregular update for healthcare providers\nPotential Resource Implications\nThere should be a strong commitment to:\na)\nensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare providers\nb)\ninitiate training of healthcare providers ensuring information is up-\nto-date\nc)\nallocate adequate funding to ensure the effective implementation\nof the CPG recommendations\nSuccessful treatment outcome depends on early detection and\nmultidisciplinary approach. Management of Unerupted Maxillary Incisor\n2015\nProposed Clinical Audit Indicator for Quality Management\nTo assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following are proposed\nas clinical audit indicators for quality management:\n* Success is defined as eruption of unerupted maxillary incisor\ninto functional occlusion. This includes spontaneous eruption and\northodontic interventions.
