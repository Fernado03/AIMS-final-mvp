Specifically, these guidelines assist physicians in clinical\ndecision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches\nfor the diagnosis, management, and prevention of AF. Clinical Issues eg: AF\nassessment, best treatment strategy for acute AF & reduce risk of adverse\noutcomes from AF, best long term treatment strategy, management of AF in\nspecific special groups have been addressed in the CPG.\nIn a broader sense, these guidelines emphasized that AF is a worldwide public\nhealth problem with increasing incidence and prevalence, high cost, and poor\noutcomes. Importantly, this AF CPG has provided the framework for a public\nhealth approach to improve the quality of care and outcomes of all individuals with\nAF. This is a major paradigm shift from the focus on AF treatment and care that\nhas dominated the practice to IMPORTANT STRATEGIES eg: risk stratification,\nappropriate antithrombotic therapy, safety consideration of antiarrhythmic agents\nemphasized in rhythm strategy.\nThis latest version has undergone extensive revision in response to comments\nduring the public review. While considerable effort has gone into their preparation\nover the past 2 years, and every attention has been paid to their detail and scientific\nrigor, no set of guidelines, no matter how well developed, achieves its purpose\nunless it is implemented and translated into clinical practice. Implementation is an\nintegral component of the process and accounts for the success of the guidelines.\nThe Work Group is now developing implementation tools essential to the success\nof this AFCPG.\nIn a voluntary and multidisciplinary undertaking of this magnitude, many individuals\nmake contributions to the final product now in your hands. It is impossible to\nacknowledge them individually here, but to each and every one of them we extend\nour sincerest appreciation, especially to the members of the Writing Panel, an\neffort subsequently reinforced by the review of these final guidelines by the\nexternal reviewers. Thank you one and all for Making PERSON_REMOVED for patients with\nAF throughout GPE_REMOVED . A special debt of gratitude is due to the members of the\nWork Group, their chair, PERSON_REMOVED . It is their commitment and dedication\nthat has made it all possible.\n PERSON_REMOVED FNHAM\nNHAM President\nABOUT THE GUIDELINE\nGUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nThis is the first Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Atrial Fibrillation (AF). A\ncommittee was appointed by the National Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM),\nMinistry of Health (MOH) and the Academy of Medicine Malaysia (AMM) to draw up\nthis CPG. It comprises of sixteen members including cardiologists, a neurologist,\na haematologist, a cardiac surgeon, an obstetrician, a gynaecologist, general\nphysicians, an intensivist, a family medicine specialist and an emergency medicine\nspecialist from the government, private sector and the public universities.\nObjectives\nThis CPG is intended to assist health care providers in clinical decision making\nby describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis,\nmanagement, and prevention of AF.\nRigour of Development\nEvidence was obtained by systematic review of current medical literature on Atrial\nFibrillation using the usual search engines – Guidelines International Network\n(G-I-N), Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR),\nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Journal full text via\nOVID search engine, International Health Technology Assessment websites (refer\nto Appendix A for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved\narticles were searched to identify relevant studies. Search was limited to literature\npublished in English. All searches were officially conducted between 15 January\n2010 and 10 December 2011. We suggest that future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can\nbe obtained upon request from the CPG secretariat.\nReference was also made to other guidelines on Atrial Fibrillation, Guidelines\nfor the Management of Atrial Fibrillation published by The Task Force for the\nManagement of Atrial Fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)\n2010, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Atrial Fibrillation\nGuideline 2006, Evidence-based Best Practice Guideline of New Zealand on\nAtrial Fibrillation 2005 and the ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines for the Management\nof Patients With Atrial Fibrillation 2006 were also studied. These CPGs were\nevaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE)\nprior being used as references.\nForty-three clinical questions were developed and divided into eight major sections\nand members of the development panel were assigned individual questions within\nthese subtopics (refer to Appendix B for Clinical Questions). The group members\nmet a total 18 times throughout the development of the guideline. All retrieved\nliterature were appraised by at least two members and subsequently presented\nfor discussion during development group meetings.\nAll statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively by\nmembers of the Development Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient the\nrecommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. These CPG are\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nOn completion, the draft guidelines was sent for review by external reviewers. It\nwas posted on the Ministry of Health of Malaysia official website for comment and\nfeedback from any interested parties. These guidelines had also been presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council,\nMinistry of Health of Malaysia for review and approval.\nThe level of recommendation and the grading of evidence used in this guideline\nwere adapted from the American Heart Association and the European Society of\nCardiology (AHA/ESC) and outlined on page xi. In the text, this is written in black\nand boxed on the left hand margin.\nSources of Funding\nSanofi Aventis (M) Sdn. Bhd. supported the development of the CPG on\nManagement of Atrial Fibrillation financially. However, the views of the funding\nbody have not influenced the content of the guideline.\n1. How do you assess a patient suspected of having atrial fibrillation?\n2. What is the best strategy to treat patients with atrial fibrillation in the acute\nsetting?\n3. What is the best strategy to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes from atrial\nfibrillation?\n4. What is the best long-term management strategy?\n5. How to manage atrial fibrillation in specific special groups? \nTarget Group\nThis CPG is directed at all healthcare providers treating patients with AF –\nallied professionals, family and general physicians, medical officers, emergency\nphysicians, intensivists and cardiologists.\nTarget Population\nIt is developed to assist clinical decision making for all adults and pregnant\nwomen with AF.\nPeriod of Validity of the Guidelines\nThis guideline needs to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with\nrecent developments and knowledge.\nImplementation of the Guidelines\nTo ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n1. Constant checks and feedback on whether the guideline is relevant.\n2. Identify implementation leaders\nIdentification of multiple leaders to share the implementation work and ensure\nseamless care. These leaders are likely to be prominent figures who will\nchampion the guideline and inspire others.\n3. Identify an implementation group\nSupport from medical associations such as the Private Medical Practitioners\nSociety (PMPS), Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (SOPACE)\nand Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) will help dissemination of the\nguidelines.\n4. Carrying out a baseline assessment\nThis involves comparing current practice with the recommendations. The audit\ncriteria will help this baseline assessment.\n5. Developing an action plan\nThe baseline assessment will have identified which recommendations are\nnot currently being carried out. These recommendations could be put into an\naction plan.\n6. Key areas for implementation\nWe have identified several goals for implementation based on the key priorities\nfor implementation identified in the guideline\nGUIDELINE WORKING GROUP\nChairperson\nDr Ahmad Nizar b Jamaluddin\nConsultant Cardiologist & Electrophysiologist\nSime Darby Medical Centre\nSelangor\nDr Anita bt Alias\nIntensivist\nHospital Melaka\nMelaka\nDatuk Dr Hj Azhari b Rosman,\nConsultant Cardiologist & Electrophysiologist\nNational Heart Institute\nKuala Lumpur\nDato’ Dr Chang Kian Meng\nConsultant Heamatologist & Head of Department\nDepartment of Haematology\nHospital Ampang\nKuala Lumpur\nDr Ernest Ng Wee Oon\nConsultant Cardiologist and Electrophysiologist\nPantai Hospital KL\nKuala Lumpur\nDr Hashim b Tahir\nConsultant Obstetrician & Gynaecologist\nUniversiti Technologi MARA\nSelangor\nAssociate Professor Dr Imran b Zainal Abidin\nAssociate Professor of Medicine & Consultant Cardiologist\nUniversity Malaya Medical Centre\nKuala Lumpur\nDr Jeswant Dillon\nConsultant Cardiothoracic Surgeon\nNational Heart Institute\nKuala Lumpur\nProfessor Dato’ Dr Khalid b Haji Yusoff,\nProfessor of Medicine and Senior Consultant Cardiologist\nUniversiti Teknologi MARA\nSelangor\nDr Lai Voon Ming\nConsultant Cardiologist and Electrophysiologist\nSri Kota Medical Centre\nSelangor\nDr Ngau Yen Yew\nConsultant Physician\nHospital Kuala Lumpur\nKuala Lumpur\nDato’ Dr Omar b Ismail,\nConsultant Cardiologist & Head of Department\nDepartment of Cardiology\nHospital Pulau Pinang\nProf. Madya Dr Oteh b Maskon\nConsultant Cardiologist & Head of Department\nDepartment of Cardiology\nHospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia\nKuala Lumpur\nDatuk Dr Raihanah bt Abdul Khalid\nConsultant Neurologist\nPantai Hospital KL\nKuala Lumpur\nDr Ridzuan b Dato Mohd Isa\nEmergency Medicine Specialist & Head of Department\nDepartment of Accident & Emergency\nHospital Ampang\nKuala Lumpur\nDr V Paranthaman\nFamily Medicine Specialist & Head of Department\nKlinik Kesihatan Jelapang\nPerak\nEXTERNAL REVIEWERS\n1) Dato’ Ravindran Jegasothy\nSenior Consultant & Head of Department\nObstetrics & Gynaecology\nHospital Kuala Lumpur\n2) Datuk Dr Razali b Omar\nDeputy Head, Consultant Cardiologist & Electrophysiologist\nDirector of Clinical Electrophysiology & Pacemaker Service\nDepartment of Cardiology\n3) Professor Dr Sim Kui Hian\nVisiting Senior Consultant Cardiologist\nDepartment of Cardiology\nSarawak General Hospital Heart Centre\nAdjunct Professor\nFaculty of Medicine & Health Sciences\nUniversity Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)\n4) Dato’ Dr. Sree Raman\nSenior Consultant Physician\nHospital Tuanku Jaafar\nSeremban\n5) Dr Tai Li Ling\nConsultant Intensivist\nDepartment of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care\nHospital Kuala Lumpur.\nSUMMARY\nKEY MESSAGES\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed in all patients, whether\nsymptomatic or not, in whom AF is suspected because an irregular pulse\nhas been detected.\nThe stroke risk stratification algorithms, CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc,\nshould be used in patients with AF to assess their risk of stroke and\nthrombo-embolism, while the HAS-BLED score should be used to assess\ntheir risk of bleeding.\nAntithrombotic therapy should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke/\nthrombo-embolism and bleeding, and the relative risk and benet for a\ngiven patient.\nWhen choosing either an initial rate-control or rhythm-control strategy, the\nindications for each option should not be regarded as mutually exclusive\nand the potential advantages and disadvantages of each strategy should be\nexplained to patients before agreeing which to adopt. Any comorbidities that\nmight indicate one approach rather than the other should be taken into\naccount . Irrespective of whether a rate-control or a rhythm-control strategy\nis adopted in patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF, appropriate\nantithrombotic therapy should be used.\nWhen choosing an antiarrhythmic agent for rhythm control strategy, safety\nrather than efficacy considerations should primarily guide the choice of\nantiarrhythmic agent.\nIn patients with permanent AF, who need treatment for rate control, betablockers or rate-limiting calcium antagonists should be the preferred initial\nmonotherapy in all patients while digoxin should only be considered as\nmonotherapy in predominantly sedentary patients.\nThe management cascade for patients with AF.
