A. Screening, Diagnosis and Investigation\n\u2022 Hepatitis C screening should be targeted for populations with\nincreased risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or exposure. \u2022 Screening for HCV infection should be based on the detection of\nantibodies to HCV by rapid diagnostic test or laboratory-based\nimmunoassay. \u2022 Confirmation of active viraemia or ongoing chronic HCV infection\nshould be based on the detection of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or\nHCV core antigen (HCVcAg). \u2022 Non-invasive measures may be used to assess the degree of liver\nfibrosis in hepatitis C. B. Treatment, Monitoring and Follow-up\n\u2022 Prior to initiation of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C,\n\uf0a1 identify presence of co-morbidity and perform baseline\ninvestigations\n\uf0a1 assess for cirrhosis status\n\uf0a1 evaluate for drug-drug interactions\n\uf0a1 counsel to avoid pregnancy for female patient and female\npartner of male patient during and six months after completion of\ntreatment\n\u2022 All hepatitis C patients (confirmed viraemia) should be initiated with\nDAAs within a year. \u2022 In patients with hepatitis C and non-cirrhotic liver disease, the\ncombination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir may be prescribed for\ntreatment. \u2022 Routine laboratory monitoring shall be limited at week 4 of treatment\nand 12 weeks post-DAA treatment for hepatitis C. \uf0a1 Additional monitoring for full blood count should be done for\nhepatitis C patients treated with ribavirin.", "chunk_order": 1}

The\nquality of each retrieved evidence and its effect size are carefully\nassessed/reviewed by the CPG Development Group. In formulating\nthe recommendations, overall balances of the following aspects are\nconsidered in determining the strength of the recommendations:-\n\u2022 overall quality of evidence\n\u2022 balance of benefits versus harms\n\u2022 values and preferences\n\u2022 resource implications\n\u2022 equity, feasibility and acceptability\nLevel\nI\nII-1\nII-2\nII-3\nIII\nStudy design\nEvidence from at least one properly randomised controlled trial\nEvidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without\nrandomisation\nEvidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control\nanalytic studies, preferably from more than one centre or\ngroup\nEvidence from multiple time series with or without intervention;\ndramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the\nresults of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s)\ncould also be regarded as this type of evidence\nOpinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience;\ndescriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert\ncommittees\nManagement of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults\niii\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these Clinical\nPractice Guidelines (CPG) were from the Ministry of Health (MoH),\nMinistry of Education and private sector. There was active involvement\nof a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. A literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of\nSystemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International\nNetwork (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The\nsearch was limited to literature published in the last ten years, on\nhumans, adults and in English. In addition, the reference lists of all\nretrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify\nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify\nfurther studies. All searches were conducted from 3 January 2018\nto 9 January 2019. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31 July 2019 to be included.", "chunk_order": 2}

Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from\nthe CPG Secretariat. References were made to other guidelines on hepatitis C e.g. \u2022 Guidelines for The Care and Treatment of Persons Diagnosed with\nChronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection (World Health Organization,\n2018)\n\u2022 EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C (European\nAssociation for the Study of the Liver, 2016 and 2018)\n\u2022 Hepatitis\nC\nGuidance\n2018\nUpdate:\nAASLD-IDSA\nRecommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis\nC Virus Infection (American Association for the Study of Liver\nDiseases and Infectious Diseases Society of America, 2018)\nA total of 11 main clinical questions were developed under five different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin five sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 18 times throughout the development of\nthese guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least\ntwo DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist,\npresented in evidence tables and further discussed in DG meetings. All statements and recommendations subsequently formulated were\nagreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient,\nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults\niv\nThis CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, metaanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG strictly\nfollows the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official websitefor\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and\nCPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval. Details on the\nCPG development methodology by MaHTAS can be obtained from\nManual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based\nClinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/CPG_MANUAL_MAHTAS. pdf?mid=634).", "chunk_order": 3}

The prevalence rate of people\nliving with HCV infection among those aged 15 - 64 years is 2.5%.2; 3\nMany of the estimated 380,000 people living with hepatitis C remain\nundiagnosed.4 Screening and access to care of HCV is crucial to\nreduce the transmission and address the increasing disease burden\nin the country.2 With the initiatives by the Ministry of Health (MoH)\nMalaysia, in-line with World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s strategy\ntowards elimination of hepatitis C by 2030, screening and treatment of\nhepatitis C has expanded tremendously. At present, MoH is focussing\non screening the high risk populations in particular people who inject\ndrugs (PWID). The landscape of treatment for hepatitis C has evolved\nwith the accessibility of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) which are\ngenerally effective, well tolerated and given for 12 - 24 weeks. Locally, the common genotypes found are genotype 3 (61.9%) and 1\n(35.9%) which may give variation in treatment regime.5 People who\nare HCV-infected are at risk of developing advanced liver disease,\ncontributing to the continuous rise in HCV-related morbidity and\nmortality. Approximately 60 - 70% of chronically infected person will\neventually develop chronic liver disease of which 5 - 20% will have\ncirrhosis of the liver and 1 - 5% will die of cirrhosis or hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC).2\nThe primary goal of HCV treatment is to cure the infection i.e. to achieve\na sustained virological response (SVR). In view of high disease burden\nand variation in practice, an evidence-based CPG is required to guide\nhealthcare providers locally in the management of hepatitis C. Management of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adults\n2. SCREENING\nMost chronic HCV infected individuals are asymptomatic and thus\nunaware of their infection.

It becomes detectable in blood a few days after\nHCV RNA. HCVcAg, which uses enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is a lowercost option than molecular test. However, it is less sensitive than HCV\nRNA assay (lower limit of detection equivalent to approximately 500 to\n3,000 HCV RNA IU/mL).14\nUsing a threshold of quantifiable HCV RNA (\u226515 IU/mL), HCVcAg\ndemonstrates consistently high specificity (98 - 100%) at all time-points\nbut a wide range of sensitivity (31 - 100%). Among baseline samples,\nthere is a strong correlation between HCVcAg levels and HCV RNA\nlevels (rs 0.767 - 0.89, p \u22640.0001).15 - 16, level III\nWHO has suggested that HCVcAg is too limited to recommend for its\nuse as a substitute for HCV RNA as assessment of test of cure, known\nas SVR.17 However, EASL allows this as an alternative if the latter is not\navailable and/or not affordable to be done at SVR 24.14\n\u2022\nHCV molecular\nHCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect the\npresence of the virus, determine if the infection is active and if the\nindividual would benefit from antiviral treatment. This assay detects the\npresence of viral RNA through targeting a specific segment of the virus. The use of quantitative or qualitative molecular test for detection of HCV\nRNA is recommended as the preferred strategy to diagnose viraemic\ninfection following a reactive HCV antibody serological test.

SPECIAL GROUPS\n5.1 Hepatitis B Co-infection\nHBV/HCV co-infection is more common among PWID or in areas where\nthese two viruses are endemic. Co-infection of HBV/HCV increases risk\nfor HCC by 13.3%.46 HBV/HCV co-infected patients should be treated\nsimilar to HCV mono-infected once HBV status has been assessed. In a meta-analysis of 17 cohort studies on HBV/HCV co-infection\nreceiving DAAs treatment, HBV reactivation occurred more frequently\nin patients with chronic [hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)] than\nresolved [HBsAg-negative/hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive]\ninfection.

Fewer HIV/\nHCV co-infected patients have been treated in DAAs trials; however, the\neffectiveness rates among these groups have been remarkably similar\nto the HCV mono-infected groups in the evidence discussed below. Treatment of HIV/HCV co-infected patients requires special attention\ndue to the complexity of DDIs that can occur between DAAs and\nantiretroviral medications. \u2022 CPG DG suggests that antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be\ninitiated first and DAAs should be delayed in patients with HIV/\nHCV co-infection. This is to allow viral suppression and to avoid the\ndifficulty in recognising ADR. \u2022 If patients are not ready for ART, DAAs shall be considered if there\nare no contraindications. The DDIs are summarised in Appendix 6. i. Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir\nTwo studies looked at the effectiveness of SOF+DCV in HIV/HCV coinfections.

The\ncombination was safe and well tolerated.48. level II-3 In another study,\nvarious combinations of DAAs which includes SOF+DCV (25% of\npatients) for 12 weeks were associated with 91% of SVR12 in GT1, 3\nor 4 HIV/HCV co-infections.49, level II-2\nThe dose of DCV should be increased from 60 mg to 90 mg when\nused with potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 e.g. efavirenz\n(EFV), etravirine (ETV) or nevirapine (NVP). Meanwhile it should be\ndecreased from 60 mg to 30 mg when used with CYP 3A4 inhibitor\ne.g. ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, cobicistat-boosted atazanavir or\nelvitegravir/cobicistat.
