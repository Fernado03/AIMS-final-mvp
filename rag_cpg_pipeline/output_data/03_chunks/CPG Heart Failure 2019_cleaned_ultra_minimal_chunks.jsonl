Electronic version available on the following website:\nhttp://www.moh.gov.my\nhttp://www.acadamed.org.my\nThis is an update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines on Heart Failure (published\n2000, 2007 and 2014). It supersedes the previous CPGs on Heart Failure (2000,\n2007, 2014). STATEMENT OF INTENT\nPERIOD OF VALIDITY\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nIt gives me great pleasure to write a message for another\nClinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on the Management of\nHeart Failure (HF), which is now in its fourth edition. The first\nCPG in HF was published in 2000 with revisions in 2007 and\n2014. Cardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity\nand mortality in Malaysia. HF, the end stage of most diseases\nof the heart, is a common medical problem encountered in\nclinical practice and is an important cause of hospital\nadmissions and readmissions. It is also an important cause of\nhospital expenditure. Since the last CPG in 2014 the treatment modalities for the\nmanagement of HF has expanded extensively. There have\nbeen many significant developments in the use of drugs and\ndevices. These\nguideline-changing\ndata\nhave\nbeen\nincorporated into this CPG, taking into account our local\nhealth resources. A CPG is only successful if it is accepted and implemented. I encourage all healthcare providers involved in the\nmanagement of HF in children and adults to adopt these\nrecommendations in your practice. Finally, I would like to congratulate the Chairman and\nmembers of the Expert Committee for developing such a\ncomprehensive CPG. Thanks to you, as well as the External\nReviewers, for your time and effort.", "chunk_order": 0}

Heart Failure (HF), the end stage of most diseases of the heart, is a\ncommon medical problem encountered in general practice and is an important\ncause of hospital admissions and readmissions. It is also an important cause of\nhospital expenditure. As the population ages, the prevalence of HF is expected to\nincrease. The 1st Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) in HF was published in 2000 with\nrevisions in 2007 and 2014. Since then, there have been many new developments\nin this field. Thus the publication of this 4th edition is timely. This CPG proposes a\nstructured multidisciplinary strategy for the seamless care of patients with HF\nbetween hospital and community care. This CPG was drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart Association\nof Malaysia and Ministry of Health. It consists of a multidisciplinary team of cardiologists,\nnephrologists, family medicine specialists, general physicians and pharmacists from\nthe government, private sectors and the public Universities. The external reviewers\nwere also made up of a multidisciplinary team. Members of the public - patients and\ncarers - however, were not included. Objectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to:\n\uf06c Update the current management of HF based on recent evidence with respect to:\n\uf0d8 Prevention\n\uf0d8 Diagnosis\n\uf0d8 Treatment \u2013 pharmacotherapy, device and surgical therapy\n\uf0d8 Rehabilitation\n\uf0d8 End of life and palliative care\n\uf06c Recognise and manage HF in special populations:\n\uf0d8 Adult congenital heart disease\n\uf0d8 Geriatric population\n\uf0d8 Pregnant women\n\uf06c Develop a structured multidisciplinary strategy for the management of patients\nwith HF both in the primary and secondary care setting. RATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nProcess\nThe last CPG published in 2014 was used as a base. In addition to the previous\nclinical questions that needed to be updated, the Expert Panel formulated new\nquestions that needed to be addressed. These clinical questions were then divided\ninto sections and each member was assigned one or more topics. A review of current medical literature on HF from 1st October 2013 (the date of the\nlast CPG) till 31st August 2018 was performed. Literature search was carried out\nusing the following electronic databases - PubMed and Cochrane Database of\nSystemic Reviews.The following MeSH terms or free text terms were used either\nsingly or in combination:\n\u201cHeart Failure\u201d, \u201cCongestive Cardiac Failure\u201d, \u201cAcute Heart Failure, \u201cChronic Heart\nFailure\u201d \u201cRight Heart Failure\u201d, \u201cLeft Heart Failure\u201d [MeSH], \u201cHeart Failure Reduced\nLeft Ventricular Function\u201d, Heart Failure Preserved Left Ventricular Function\u201d\n[MeSH], Acute decompensated heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy,\nheart failure mid-range, refractory heart failure, terminal heart failure, end stage\nheart failure, cardio-oncology.

In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were\nsearched to identify further studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain\nfurther information. International guidelines on HF - the American Heart Association\n/ American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology - were also\nstudied. All literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and\nall statements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The grading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was\nadapted from the American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association and\nthe European Society of Cardiology (Table 1, Page 12). After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and\nkey health personnel in the major hospitals of the Ministry of Health and the private\nsector for review and feedback. Clinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated addressing the\ndiagnosis and management of HF. For diagnosis: In a person presenting with shortness of breath:\n\uf0d8 What features in the history and clinical examination would make one suspect\nthis patient is having a HF? \uf0d8 What diagnostic tests help confirm the clinical suspicion of HF with reasonable\nsensitivity and specificity?", "chunk_order": 3}

Target Group:\nThis guideline is directed at all healthcare providers involved in the management of\nHF in children and adults. Target Population:\nIt is developed to treat all individuals with and at risk of HF. Period of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with\nrecent developments and knowledge that is being learnt. Applicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThis guideline was developed taking into account our local health resources. Blood\ninvestigations, chest radiographs, ECGs and echocardiograms are common in\nalmost all public health facilities. The drugs used to treat HF - diuretics, ACE-I,\n\u03b2-blockers have been approved for use in Malaysia and available in public hospitals\nas generics. This guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimise\nexisting resources in the timely management of patients with HF. Facilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barrier for successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of knowledge\nof healthcare providers in the:\n\uf06c Diagnosis of HF. \uf06c Management of HF - initial treatment and long term follow-up. \uf06c Optimisation of therapy and when to refer to tertiary centres. Implementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical\ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\uf06c Increasing public awareness of CVD and HF in general and educating them on\nthe importance of seeking early medical attention. \uf06c Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the\nimportance of appropriate management of patients with HF. This can be done\nby road shows, electronic media, and in-house training sessions. Clinical audit by individual hospitals and units to ensure compliance using the\nsuggested performance measures in Section 12, Page 115 and Appendix VI, pg 121.

Key message 2: Definition and Classfication\n\uf06c HF is a clinical syndrome due to any structural or physiological abnormality of\nthe heart resulting in its inability to meet the metabolic demands of the body or\nits ability to do so only at higher than normal filling pressures. \uf06c HF can also be classified according to the clinical presentation into:\n\uf0d8 Acute heart failure (Acute HF)\n\uf0d8 Chronic heart failure (Chronic HF). \uf06c In the setting of Left Ventricular (LV) myocardial dysfunction, left ventricular\nejection fraction (LVEF) may be:\n\uf0d8 Reduced (LVEF \u2264 40%) - Heart failure with reduced ejection function (HFrEF). \uf0d8 Preserved (LVEF \u2265 50%) - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)\n\uf0d8 Mid-range (LVEF 41%-49%) - Heart failure with the LVEF being in the mid\nrange (HFmrEF). Key message 3: Diagnosis\n\uf06c The clinical suspicion of HF should be supported by objective clinical evidence\nof cardiac dysfunction. (Flow Chart I, Page 28)\n\uf06c Exercise capacity in a patient with heart disease is assessed by the New York\nHeart Association (NYHA) functional classification. \uf06c Relevant investigations help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of\nHF and the aetiology. Key message 4: Prevention\n\uf06c Prevention and early intervention wherever appropriate, should be the primary\nobjective of management. SUMMARY\nKey message 5: Acute Heart Failure (AHF)\n\uf06c AHF may present as:\n\uf0d8 Pulmonary and/or peripheral oedema (\u201cwet\u201d - volume overload)\n\uf0d8 Low output state - shock (\u201cdry\u201d - usually due to pump failure)\n\uf0d8 Combination of pulmonary oedema and a low output state\n\uf06c The principles of management are:\n\uf0d8 Rapid recognition of the condition. \uf0d8 Identification and stabilisation of life threatening haemodynamics. \uf0d8 Maintaining oxygenation and perfusion of the vital organs. \uf0d8 Relieving clinical symptoms and signs.", "chunk_order": 8}

Key message 8:Heart Failure with Preserved LV Function (HFpEF)\n\uf06c HFpEF is a common cause of HF in the elderly. \uf06c Hypertension is an important cause and should be treated according to guidelines. \uf06c Management remains empiric since trial data are limited. \uf06c Treat volume overload with diuretics and manage comorbidities. Key message 9: HFrEF in Special Groups\n\uf06c Diabetes\n\uf0d8 Persons with diabetes are managed in the same manner as persons without\ndiabetes. \uf0d8 When managing diabetes in patients with HF:\n\uf075 The sodium-glucose cotransport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown\nto reduce CV mortality and HF hospitalisations. \uf075 Saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and thiazolidinediones\nare best avoided because of a trend towards harm. \uf075 Sulphonylureas, biguanides like metformin and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors\nlike acarbose are generally safe. \uf06c Pregnancy\n\uf0d8 The management of HF in pregnancy is more difficult than in the non-pregnant\nstate and should be managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians,\nobstetricians and paediatricians. \uf0d8 Patients with LVEF < 30% and those in NYHA Class III and IV should be\nstrongly advised not to get pregnant. They should be refered to the pre-pregnancy\nclinic for advise on the modes of contraception. If pregnant, termination should\nbe considered. \uf0d8 HF that develops during pregnancy can be managed with the judicious use\nof diuretics, digoxin, nitrates, \u03b2-blockers and/or hydralazine. \uf06c Arrhythmias\n\uf0d8 Arrhythmia-induced HF (also known as Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy)\nis a reversible cause of HF. \uf0d8 Successful treatment of the arrhythmia by drug therapy or catheter ablation\ncan result in normalisation of LV function. \uf06c Cardio-oncology\n\uf0d8 Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common; clinical HF occurs in 1-5%. \uf0d8 Close collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \uf0d8 Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation\nand assessment and treatment of CV risk factors. \uf06c Chronic Kidney Disease\n\uf0d8 Cardiac and kidney disease frequently co-exist and this increases the complexity\nand costs of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \uf0d8 Management includes the use of intravenous diuretics, careful use of Renin\nAngiotensin System (RAS) blockers, \u03b2-blockers and occasionally ultrafiltration\nand haemodialysis. Key message 10: Advanced Heart Failure\nPatients with advanced HF should be referred to assess whether they may be\npotential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. Left Ventricular Assist\nDevice - LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy,\nshould be considered for palliative and end of life care.", "chunk_order": 10}

The prevalence of HF varies between 3 - 20 per 1000 population, although\nin persons over the age of 65 years, it could be as high as 100 per 1000 population.1\nIn nearly all regions of the world HF is both common and increasing, affecting\nbetween 1 - 2% of the population.2,3\nThe main causes of HF amongst adult Malaysians were ischaemic heart disease\n(68%), valvular/rheumatic heart disease (29%) and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy\n(28%).4 Vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and\ndyslipidaemia were common in Asian HF patients, particularly so in Malaysia (75%,\n67%, and 52%, respectively).4 In-patient mortality was 6%, with a 30-day readmission\nrate of 30%.4\nHF is an important cause of hospitalisation accounting for about 6% - 10% of all\nacute medical admissions in Malaysia.5,6\nIt is also an important cause of hospital re-admissions.7,8 About 25% of patients with\nHF are readmitted within 30 days for acute decompensation.7,8 The prognosis for HF\nremains poor. The 1-year mortality rate varies between 5% to 52% depending on the\nseverity and the presence of co-morbidity.9,10 With a 5-year mortality at 48%, HF is\ndeadlier than many cancers, for example, colorectal cancer (35.5%), non Hodgkin\u2019s\nlymphoma (29.6%), and breast cancer (10%).9-11\nThe overall global economic cost of HF in 2012 was estimated at $USD108 billion\n(MYR 439 billion) per annum.12 The economic impact includes both direct and\nindirect costs.12,13 Globally, direct costs accounted for ~ 60% ($USD 65 billion -\nMYR 264 billion) and indirect costs accounted for ~ 40% ($USD43 billion - MYR 175\nbillion) of the overall spent.12 With an aging, rapidly expanding and industrialising\npopulation this value will continue to rise. For Malaysia, the estimated overall HF costs was $USD 194 million (MYR 785\nmillion), of which the direct and indirect costs were $USD 12 million (MYR 48.7\nmillion) and $USD 182 million (MYR 740 million).12 This is approximately 1.8% of\ntotal health expenditure, with 3.6% GDP spent on health.", "chunk_order": 15}

In general, in most low and\nmedium economies like Malaysia, the indirect costs of HF in terms of premature\nmortality, morbidity, lost earning potential and unpaid care costs outweigh the direct\ncosts. HF poses a major health and economic burden and an important goal in\nmanagement is to prevent readmissions, thus reducing both direct and indirect\ncosts.12\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to help health care\nproviders in the management of their patients with HF. Beyond the Clinical Practice\nGuidelines (CPG), clinical management needs to be individualised to take into\naccount patient\u2019s overall health goals, values, perspectives and preferences. Sound clinical judgment plays an important role in formulating appropriate\npatient-centred care plans. HF is a clinical syndrome due to any structural or physiological abnormality of the\nheart resulting in its inability to meet the metabolic demands of the body or its ability\nto do so only at higher than normal filling pressures. This may be accompanied by\nsigns and symptoms of systemic hypoperfusion and/or volume overload. Patients\nmay have typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue) and\nsigns (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, ankle oedema, pulmonary crackles,\nand displaced apex beat). Occasionally, some patients may present without\nsigns or symptoms of volume overload. HF may be the result of any disorder of the endocardium, myocardium,\npericardium or great vessels although commonly, it is due to myocardial\ndysfunction. It may involve only the left and/or right ventricle (RV). HF may be classified in many ways. A commonly used classification is by left\nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). (Table 4, Page 36) This has been shown to have\nprognostic significance.14-16 Furthermore, aetiology, demographic characteristics and\nresponse to therapies differ in the different classes.14,15\n2. DEFINITION\n3. CLASSIFICATION\nKey messages 1:\n\uf06c HF is an important cause of hospitalisation accounting for about 6% - 10%\nof all acute medical admissions and an important cause of hospital\nreadmissions in Malaysia. \uf06c HF costs was estimated to account for approximately 1.8% of total health\nexpenditure. For practical purposes, HF can also be classified according to the clinical\npresentation into:\n\uf06c Acute heart failure (Acute HF) - defined as the rapid onset of symptoms and signs\nof HF due to an acute deterioration of cardiac function in the presence or\nabsence of previous cardiac disease. \uf06c Chronic heart failure (Chronic HF) - this is a chronic state when patients have\nstable symptoms. In these patients, an acute precipitating or aggravating\nfactor(s) may cause acute cardiac decompensation. The main pathophysiology of HF is due to a decrease in cardiac output.", "chunk_order": 16}

In these patients, an acute precipitating or aggravating\nfactor(s) may cause acute cardiac decompensation. The main pathophysiology of HF is due to a decrease in cardiac output. This will\nresult in the following compensatory mechanisms:\n\uf06c A higher ventricular end diastolic pressure - This is a compensatory mechanism\nto increase stroke volume by the Frank Starling mechanism. \uf06c Neurohormonal activation of the:\n\uf0d8 Sympathetic nervous system\n\uf0d8 Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n\uf0d8 Vasopressin\nThis neurohormonal activation is aimed at increasing stroke volume and cardiac\noutput by:\n\uf0d8 An increase in heart rate and ventricular contraction\n\uf0d8 Vasoconstriction of arterial resistance vessels to maintain blood pressure\n\uf0d8 Venous constriction to increase venous preload\n\uf0d8 Salt and water retention to increase preload\nIn general, these neurohormonal responses are compensatory mechanisms. However they can also aggravate HF by increasing ventricular afterload and\nincreasing preload to the point where pulmonary and/or systemic congestion and\noedema occur. In the setting of LV myocardial dysfunction, LVEF may be:\n\uf06c Reduced (LVEF \u2264 40%) - Heart failure with reduced ejection function (HFrEF). \uf06c Preserved (LVEF \u2265 50%) - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). \uf06c Mid-range (LVEF 41%-49%) - Heart Failure with the LVEF being in the mid range\n(HFmrEF). 4. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\n4.1 HFrEF\nIn HFrEF, cardiac output is reduced due to depressed myocardial contractility,\nirrespective of the aetiology. This leads to a cascade of pathophysiological changes\nas outlined above. There are effective medical and device therapies that have been\nshown to have survival benefit in HFrEF. 4.2 HFpEF\nAbout 50% of patients presenting with HF have normal systolic function with\npredominantly diastolic dysfunction.7,17,18 Diastolic dysfunction leads to impaired\nleft ventricular (LV) filling due to decreased relaxation (during early diastole)\nand/or reduced compliance (early to late diastole) leading to elevated filling\npressures. These haemodynamic changes are accompanied by predominantly\nsigns of pulmonary and/or venous congestion and occasionally systemic\nhypoperfusion as well. There is limited data available on therapies that improve\nsurvival in HFpEF unlike those with HFrEF. 4.3 HFmrEF\nPatients with HFmrEF have a clinical profile that are closer to those of patients with\nHFpEF than those of HFrEF. This category of patients is poorly studied and their\nresponse to therapies is unknown. Data seems to indicate that they have all cause\nreadmission risk that are higher than HFpEF.", "chunk_order": 17}

DIAGNOSIS\nSigns which are more specific for HF are an elevated jugular venous pulse (JVP),\nand a third heart sound. These signs are associated with adverse outcomes.19 A\nfourth heart sound is due to atrial contraction and is more frequent in patients with\nHFpEF. It is absent in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). These signs may be accompanied by a laterally displaced apical impulse and a\ncardiac murmur. Other supportive signs include peripheral oedema, tachycardia,\nnarrow pulse pressure, pulmonary crepitations, hepatomegaly and ascites. These\nclinical findings may be transient and resolve completely following initial therapy. However, these signs are difficult to detect and are not always easily reproducible in\nthe elderly, the obese and in patients with chronic lung disease. Occasionally\nsymptoms and signs of volume overload may be absent and the patient may present\nwith fatigue only. In patients presenting with dysnoea, acute LV failure can sometimes mimic an acute\nexacerbation of bronchial asthma. Thus, a proper history and clinical examination is\nessential. Exercise capacity in a patient with heart disease is assessed by the New York Heart\nAssociation (NYHA) functional classification.

MANAGEMENT\nThe onset and severity of symptoms can vary depending on the nature of the\nunderlying disease and the rate at which the syndrome develops. The\nspectrum of clinical findings may range from worsening of peripheral oedema\nto life threatening pulmonary oedema or cardiogenic shock. It often requires\nurgent evaluation and treatment, which typically leads to hospitalisation. Assessment and management must be made promptly and simultaneously. The principles of management are:\n\uf06c Rapid recognition of the condition. \uf06c Identification and stabilisation of life threatening haemodynamics. \uf06c Maintaining oxygenation and perfusion of the vital organs. \uf06c Relieving clinical symptoms and signs. \uf06c Identification and treatment of the underlying cause and precipitating/\naggravating factors. 8.1.1 Classification of AHF\nThere are a number of ways to classify patients with AHF.

(See Section 8.5.6, Page 103)\n8.1.8 Cardiogenic Shock\nCardiogenic shock carries a very high mortality rate. The In hospital mortality\nwas > 70% decades ago but recently improved at 27-51% with current\ntherapy and management.166,167\nFeatures include:\n\uf0d8 SBP < 90mmHg not improved with fluid administration. \uf0d8 Signs of hypoperfusion - cold extremities, altered mental status,\nrestlessness. \uf0d8 Reduced urine output (< 20cc/hour). \uf0d8 Cardiac index* of < 1.8 L/min/m2 without support or 2.2 L/min/m2 with\nsupport. \uf0d8 PCWP >=15mmHg\n\uf0d8 Serum Lactate > 2.0 mmol/L. *cardiac index = cardiac output/body surface area\nIt is important to establish the aetiology and institute appropriate resuscitative\ntherapy immediately. An ECG should be obtained and continuous monitoring\nbegun. Venous access should be secured, preferably via central venous\ncannulation (subclavian or internal jugular). Wherever possible, these patients should be transferred to a tertiary centre\nwith PCI capable facilities. Important considerations are:\n\uf06c Ventricular Function:\n\uf0d8 Echocardiography would allow rapid determination of LV function and\nmechanical causes (e.g. acute valve regurgitation, acute septal rupture,\ncardiac tamponade) of cardiogenic shock. \uf0d8 In the presence of preserved LV systolic function, other causes of shock\nsuch as sepsis and intravascular volume depletion should be considered. \uf06c Intra Vascular Volume Status:\n\uf0d8 An absolute or relative reduction in LV filling pressures may be present. \uf0d8 This may be due to excessive diuretic or vasodilator therapy, concomitant\ngastro-intestinal bleed or RV infarction. \uf0d8 In the absence of signs of LV failure, fluid challenge with normal saline\nshould be administered. Judicious administration of fluids (usual\nrecommended volume: 100-200 mls) tapered to clinical response and\nsigns of fluid overload. \uf0d8 Invasive haemodynamic monitoring would be useful to guide fluid therapy. \uf06c Arrhythmias:\n\uf0d8 Should be identified and appropriate treatment such as cardioversion\nor pacing instituted. \uf0d8 Resistant arrhythmias would require antiarrhythymic drug therapy or\nradiofrequency ablation. In the presence of cardiogenic shock or near shock (hypoperfusion with\nadequate blood pressure) treatment would include the following:\n\uf06c Inotropic support: Noradrenaline and/or dopamine. If blood pressure is\nadequate in the setting of near shock, dobutamine may be used. \uf06c Mechanical device support: IABP or LVAD.142-147\nKey messages:\n\uf06c AHF may present as:\n\uf0d8 Pulmonary and/or peripheral oedema (\u201cwet\u201d- volume overload). \uf0d8 Low output state - shock (\u201cdry\u201d- usually due to pump failure). \uf0d8 Combination of pulmonary oedema and a low output state.

They\nshould:\n\uf06c Be educated on self care management. \uf06c Recognise the changes in their signs and symptoms - a sudden weight\ngain - more than 2kg in 3 days is a sign of worsening HF. \uf06c Know when to contact their healthcare provider. \uf06c Understand the indication, dosing, side effects and drug interaction of\neach medication they are prescribed. \uf06c Be warned about self-medication and potential drug interactions. \uf06c Adhere to treatment and be informed of the potential complications\nresulting from non-adherence to prescribed medication. \uf06c Provide prognostic information to enable patients to make realistic decisions\nand plans. This is important in patients with severe HF. Chronic HF is a\nhighly lethal disease, more lethal than several common malignancies. In advanced HF, treatment options must be discussed tactfully and realistically\nwith the patient and family. 8.2.1.2 Exercise training\nSeveral systematic reviews and meta-analyses support exercise training as\nan integral part of the non-pharmacological treatment of HF.168-172\nExercise training:\n\uf06c Is safe in patients with chronic stable HF.168-173\n\uf06c In patients with HFrEF, is associated with a trend towards reduction in\nall-cause mortality.168\n\uf06c In patients with HFpEF, the clinical data is sparse.

For more details, refer to the 2017 Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines on\nPrimary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,1st Ed. 8.2.1.3 Diet and nutrition\nIt has been widely accepted that sodium intake has to be restricted in patients\nwith HF especially in those with symptoms. However, clinical evidence to\nsupport this has been sparse and conflicting.177-182 Excessive salt and fluid\nrestriction can lead to intravascular depletion resulting in activation of the\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic systems leading to deleterious\ntachycardia.183\nThe current recommendation is to avoid adding salt and flavouring sauces\nsuch as soya sauce, tomato ketchup and chilli sauce while cooking or at the\ntable. Refer to Appendix II, Page 117 on salt content of common Malaysian\nfood. A good balanced diet plays an an important role to prevent energy depletion\nwhich can lead to cardiac cachexia and malnutrition. 8.2.1.4 Fluid restriction\nThe current evidence on fluid restriction is mixed.182-185 As with salt, excessive\nfluid restriction can also lead to worse outcomes.182-185 This may also be due\nto reverse causality - sicker patients tend to take less salt and water. Fluid intake should be individualised. A general recommendation is\n1-1.5 litres per day in patients with normal renal function. IIa,B\n8.2.1.5\nLifestyle measures\nThese include:\n\uf06c Weight monitoring - Patients should be encouraged to monitor their own\nweight. In obese patients, weight loss should be emphasised. \uf06c Alcohol - This should be avoided in patients with HF as it can lead to acute\ndecompensation.186 Patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy must abstain\nfrom alcohol. \uf06c Smoking should be stopped.60\n8.2.1.6 Sexual activity, pregnancy and contraception\nPhysiological and psychological changes in patients with HF often result in\nsexual dysfunction.187 These patients, in turn, often report a lower Health-related\nquality of life (HRQoL).188 This problem is further compounded by their unmet\nneed for information on sexual activities from their health care providers.187,189\nIt is imperative that enquiries on sexual activities or dysfunction be addressed\nto provide a holistic approach to patient care.190 The physician must take over\nthe initial approach since patients are often embarrassed to initiate the topic. Some helpful tools to initiate the conversation include:\n\uf06c PLISSIT (permission, limited information, specific suggestion and intensive\ntherapy).191\n\uf06c Needs of Sexual Counselling Scale for Chronic Heart Failure (NSCS-CHF)187\n\uf06c Sexual Adjustment Scale (SAS).187\nPatients should be taught:\n\uf06c To pay attention to their symptoms of HF. \uf06c The potential dangers and how to manage them when they occur during\nsexual activities. \uf06c To defer sexual activities if in NYHA III-IV. \uf06c Not to resume until his/her heart condition stabilises. \uf06c To modify sexual practices to accommodate impaired effort tolerance.", "chunk_order": 34}

I,C\nI,C\nIIa,B\nPatients with LVEF < 30% and those with NYHA III and IV should be advised\nagainst pregnancy because of high maternal mortality.192,193 If pregnant,\ntermination of pregnancy should be considered.193\nWhen pregnancy is contraindicated, then appropriate contraceptive advice\nbecomes paramount to the safety of the patient by preventing unwanted\npregnancy. The World Health Organization Medical Eligibility criteria\n(WHO-MEC) for contraceptive use offers guidance in women with specific\nmedical conditions.194\nContraceptive counselling should begin early. In the absence of randomised\ncontrolled studies, the choice of contraceptive method is almost always\nbased on expert opinion of the attending cardiologists, obstretician and\nthe patient\u2019s choice. In most cases, the ease of use and efficacy of the\nprogestogen-only long-acting reversible contraceptive methods make them a\ngood method for patients with CVD.193,195 (Appendix III and IV, Pages 118 and 119)\n8.2.1.7 Sleep disorders\nCauses of sleep disturbances in HF include pulmonary congestion, nocturnal\ndiuresis due to diuretics and anxiety. Up to 53% of adults with HF have been\nshown to have either central sleep apnoea (CSA) or OSA.196-198 OSA or CSA\nor combination of both, is commonly known as sleep disordered breathing\n(SDB). OSA may occur in normal population or in HF patients, while CSA, which may\npresent as Cheyne-Stokes respiration, is more uniquely associated with\nHF.199 Independent predictors of SDB include older age, male gender,\nobesity, low ejection fraction and the presence of AF.196,197 Polysomnography\n(PSG) is the gold standard in diagnosing OSA and CSA. However, a screening\nusing overnight pulse oximetry is useful to preselect a patient for PSG. Not only does SDB affect HRQoL, it leads to harmful effects on cardiac\nfunction, arrthymias and poorer prognosis due to the repetitive hypoxaemia,\nhypercapnia and swings in blood pressure and intrathoracic pressure.

CPAP improves daytime sleepiness for OSA patients.196 In HF patients with\nOSA, CPAP have been shown to improve HRQoL, LVEF function and HF\nsymptoms.196 However, none of the evidence so far can suggest improvement\nin terms of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.196\nI,C\nKey Recommendation # 6:\n\uf06c In Chronic HF, non-pharmacological measures play an important\nrole and it is important to :\n\uf0d8 Educate patient and family about the disease, treatment options\nand prognosis. \uf0d8 Encourage lifestyle measures. \uf0d8 Individualise fluid intake - A general recommendation is 1-1.5\nlitres per day in patients with normal renal function. \uf0d8 Provide advice regarding sexual activities and pregnancy. Treatment of CSA in HF patients remains uncertain.194 To date, trials using a\nCPAP or adaptive servo-ventilation in patients with HF have not been shown\nto be beneficial.70-72,200\nAs CSA tends to worsen when HF worsens, optimising medical therapy\nremains the main strategy in CSA. 8.2.1.8 Psychosocial support\nDuring the course of HF, psychological problems tend to occur that may be\ndue to change in lifestyle, medication therapy, implanted device and other\nprocedures. Social support reduces stress and helps in maintaining a healthy\nlifestyle and compliance to treatment. Absence of social support has been\nassociated with higher hospitalisation.201-203\nThus, it is important that family members and carers are included during\ncounselling sessions. Depressive symptoms may affect adherence and\nshould prompt referral to specialist for psychological support. 8.2.2 PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT\nDrug therapy is the mainstay of management of Chronic HF as outlined in\nFlow Chart III, Page 31. For grading of recommendations and levels of\nevidence, see Table 3, Page 33. The majority of patients with HFrEF, regardless of symptom severity, require\nlifelong optimal medical treatment (OMT) which would include an ACE-I,\n\u03b2-blocker and a Mineralocortocoid Receptor Antagonist (MRA), unless\ncontraindicated. An ARB shall be given to those who are intolerant to ACE-I. Drugs should be initiated at a low dose and uptitrated to the target doses, or\nI,B\nIII,C\nat least up to maximum tolerated doses. Drugs with less proven survival\nbenefits (e.g. diuretics) should be re-evaluated for reduction in dosage when\nOMT is not well tolerated due to a low BP. Alternatively, administering drugs\nat different timing may be considered for those with symptomatic hypotension. Wherever possible, OMT should be continued during an acute illness. If\ndiscontinued, they should be restarted as soon as the condition has\nstablised. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided in\npatients with HF.204\nA) Diuretics (Table 10, Page 68)\nDiuretics are indicated in all patients with HF in whom there are signs and\nsymptoms of fluid retention.152\nThe dose of diuretic used is variable and dependent on individual requirements.", "chunk_order": 36}

In the presence of severe congestive HF and in the acute decompensated\nstage, oral diuretic therapy may be ineffective. Intravenous therapy may be\npreferred. Adequate doses of diuretic should be used. However, these patients should\nbe monitored closely as overdiuresis can cause intravascular volume\ndepletion leading to hypotension and deterioration of renal function. Hypokalaemia is a common problem with diuretic use and oral potassium\nsupplementation is usually necessary. Patient should be educated on \u2018dry weight\u2019 management and advised to\nrecord their daily weight. If there is a consistent increase in weight of more\nthan 2kg in 3 days, patients should be educated to self-adjust their diuretic\n(frusemide) dose together with restriction of their fluid intake until their \u201cdry\nweight\u201d is regained. However, if the weight increase is associated with\nworsening symptoms or fails to respond to these measures, the patient\nshould seek medical help immediately. The diuretic of choice in patients with fluid overload is a loop diuretic i.e. frusemide. The goal is a reduction of body weight of about 1kg/day. Thiazide diuretics may be preferred in patients with hypertensive HF and mild\nfluid retention. For most patients however, a loop diuretic is often required. IIb,B\nI,A\nResponsiveness to loop diuretics diminishes as HF progresses. Uptitration of\nloop diuretics may be a preferred strategy if diuresis is inadequate. Alternatively, bumetanide, a second generation loop diuretic, may be used\nbecause of its more predictable absorption. Combination of thiazides and loop diuretics may also be used as these drugs\nwork synergistically to improve diuresis.205-207 However, this combination has\nbeen associated with hypokalaemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function\nand increased mortality.207,208\nMetolazone is a once-daily oral thiazide diuretic.

If patients are on large doses\nof diuretics, the BP and renal function should be monitored. \uf06c Start with a low dose. Patients should not remain on the initial low dose\nindefinitely. The dose should be increased gradually to the target dose\n(Table 11, Page 70) or the maximum tolerated dose. \uf06c Orthostatic hypotension should be avoided. \uf06c Renal profile should be checked periodically. Serum creatinine or estimated\nGlomerular Filtrate Rate (eGFR) may increase up to 30% from baseline\nat 7-14 days, after introduction of either an ACE-I or an ARB.

There is no significant difference in rates of hypotension, hyperkalaemia, or\nrenal dysfunction between ACE-Is and ARBs. ACE-I intolerance denotes the presence of a bothersome cough (most\ncommon, incidence:10-20%) or the experience of angioedema (uncommon,\nincidence <1%) with ACE-I therapy. Patients with this condition may be\nswitched to an ARB, although, some may still develop angioedema.222\nRoutine combined use of both ACE-I and an ARB should be avoided, as this\ncombination causes more adverse effects (hypotension, hyperkalaemia, and\nrenal dysfunction).220,223\nI,A\nTable 11: Recommended Doses of ACE-I and ARBs used in HF\nC) \u03b2-Blockers (Table 12, Page 71)\nLarge clinical trials have shown that \u03b2-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality\nin patients with NYHA Class II-IV, of both ischaemic and non-ischaemic\naetiology, on top of standard therapy.156-161,240-226\nHowever, objective improvement in cardiac function might not be apparent for\n6-12 months after \u03b2-blocker initiation.

To facilitate initiation and titration, the approved ARNI is available\nin 3 doses (50mg, 100mg, 200mg). ARNI should be considered as a replacement to ACE-I/ARB in patients with\nHFrEF who remain symptomatic to decrease CV death, HF hospitalisations,\nand symptoms.

The tolerability of ARNI and its side effect profile is similar to that of ACE-I or\nARB. Laboratory monitoring is also similar. The long term safety of this group\nof drugs is, however, still not established.231-233\nWhen initiating an ARNI:\n\uf06c Initial dosing and rate of titration is dependent on the pre-existing\ntreatment and associated comorbidities.

F) Ivabradine (Table 13, Page 72)\nIvabradine selectively inhibits the If current in the sinoatrial node, providing\nheart rate reduction. It has no effect on the ventricular rate in AF. Ivabradine resulted in a reduction in hospitalisation, improvement in LV\nfunction and quality of life without an effect on mortality in patients who\nare:234,235\n\uf06c On optimal medical therapy with diuretics, ACE-I, MRA and \u03b2-blockers, and\n\uf06c Still symptomatic (NYHA class II-III), and\n\uf06c Having a LVEF \u2264 35%, and\n\uf06c Having a resting heart rate of \u2265 70 beats /min.

Ivabradine has no effect on BP or myocardial\ncontractility. It can, however, cause symptomatic bradycardia and visual\ndisturbances. G) Digoxin\nThe use of digoxin in HF in the contemporary era remains controversial. It\nhas no proven survival benefits but it relieves symptoms and reduces\nhospitalisations.236-238 It has a narrow therapeutic range and thus close\nmonitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes (particularly potassium\nand magnesium levels) is required, prior to initiation of digoxin and periodically\nduring use. Digoxin may be added to OMT and diuretics for patients with HFrEF and in\nsinus rhythm, who continue to have moderate to severe symptoms.236-238\nIn patients with AF, combination of digoxin and \u03b2-blockers is superior to either\nagent alone.239,240\nHence, digoxin may be considered in patients with HF and AF in the following\nsituations:\n\uf06c Rate control is inadequate on \u03b2-blockers alone. \uf06c \u03b2-blockers are contraindicated. \uf06c Rapid control of the ventricular rate with parenteral drugs is required. No loading dose is required for the management of chronic HF. Lower doses\nof digoxin and lower levels of serum digoxin (0.5-0.8ng/ml or 0.65 to 1nmol/L)\nare efficacious and appear adequate in most patients with compensated\nHF.241-243 The maintenance dose of digoxin may range between 0.0625mg to\n0.25mg daily, which may be lower in elderly patients, women and those with\nrenal impairment. Regular monitoring of digoxin levels is not required other than to assess for\ntoxicity. The levels should not be used to guide dose adjustment in chronic\ntherapy. Digoxin levels may be elevated in the presence of worsening renal\nfunction, electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, or\nhypocalcaemia) or interacting drugs (e.g. amiodarone), which may lead to\natrial and ventricular arrhythmias particularly in the presence of hypokalaemia.", "chunk_order": 41}

IIa,C\nIII,A\nI,A\nI,C\nH) Nitrates\nHF symptoms such as orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea,\nexercise-induced dyspnoea, or angina may be relieved with the use of\nnitrates alone, in the form of tablets, sprays, or transdermal patches. Nitrates are mainly used in AHF. In chronic HF, the trials on nitrates have\nbeen in combination with hydralazine.244,245 This combination has been shown\nto improve survival in the African-American population with HF. 244,245\nContinuous (i.e. around the clock) use should generally be avoided to prevent\nnitrate tolerance and pseudotolerance.246\nI) Antiplatelet and Anticoagulation Therapy\nThere is no role for routine antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy in patients\nwith HFrEF.247-251\nHF patients with the following risk factors for thromboembolism should be\ngiven an appropriate anticoagulant, unless contraindicated:\n\uf06c AF - This is a common problem among patients with HF. All patients with\nAF should be given an anticoagulant, unless contraindicated.252-257\n\uf06c Intracardiac thrombus (except for organised mural thrombus).

The more common ones are:\n\uf06c Atrial fibrillation\n\uf06c Ventricular tachyarrhythmias\n\uf06c Bradyarrhythmias\nJ.1 Atrial fibrillation (AF)\nNew-onset AF in a patient with established HF is associated with a poor\nprognosis irrespective of the LVEF.258-260 On the other hand, patients who\ndeveloped AF first, followed by HF usually have a more benign course.259\nPersistent ventricular rates > 150bpm may cause an arrhythmia induced HF\nthat resolves with rate and/or rhythm control. (See Section 8.5.4, Page 98)\nI,A\nIIa,B\nIIa,B\nIIa,B\nIIa,A\nIIa,B\nPatients with AF can be managed by either rate control or rhythm\ncontrol.261-264\n\uf06c Rate control\n\uf0d8 The optimal resting ventricular rate in patients with AF and HF is unknown,\nbut probably between 75-90/min.265-267 Excessive rate control, which\nmay be associated with an increase in pauses, carries a risk.266\n\uf0d8 The optimal ventricular rate during exercise is also uncertain, but may\nbe <110/min during light exercise.264,267,268\nThis can be achieved by using either:\n\uf0d8 \u03b2-blockers239,240, 268-270 and/or\n\uf0d8 Digoxin268\n\u03b2-blockers are preferred over digoxin as it provides better rate control during\nexercise and improves morbidity and mortality in patients with HF although\nthe latter effect is attenuated in patients with AF.266,271\nRate control is better when digoxin and \u03b2-blockers are used in combination\nrather than with each drug individually.239,240\nIn patients with marked congestion who cannot tolerate \u03b2-blockers, suggest:\n\uf0d8 Oral or intravenous (i.v.) digoxin\n\uf0d8 Oral or i.v. amiodarone272,273\n\uf06c Rhythm control\nThis is indicated in patients intolerant of AF even after rate control.", "chunk_order": 42}

It varies depending on the aetiology of\nthe HF and the LVEF.275 Patients with HF and reduced LVEF (< 30 or 35%)\n(HFrEF) account for < 20% of all SCDs.276\nSCD is most often due to either sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or\nventricular fibrillation (VF) although sometimes it may be due to a\nbradyarrhythmia or electromechanical dissociation.277,278 Occasionally rapid\nsupraventricular tachycardias may deteriorate to malignant ventricular\ntachyarrhythmias.278\nThe following medications have been shown to reduce the incidence of SCD:\n\uf0d8 \u03b2-blockers: These agents were shown to reduce SCD in the clinical\ntrials done on patients post MI as well as in the HF trials.279-281\n\uf0d8 MRA: have been shown to reduce the incidence of SCD.162,163,282\n\uf0d8 ACE-I: Analysis of trials done following MI showed that ACE-I reduced\nSCD.283-286\n\uf0d8 ARNI: this reduced both sudden cardiac deaths and deaths from\nworsening HF.287\n\uf0d8 Statins: have a modest beneficial effect on SCD.288\nIn addition to the above, in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the\nfollowing are important:\n\uf06c Identify contributing factors such as electrolyte disturbances, ischaemia\nand drugs. \uf06c Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).289-293 (Section 8.2.3.2, Page 79)\n\uf06c Antiarrhythymic drug therapy with amiodarone can be considered as\nadjunctive therapy in patients with ICD to reduce the number of shocks\nand in patients who are not candidates for ICD.294\n\uf06c Radiofrequency ablation may be considered in the event of VT storms. I,C\nIII,A\nPatients with significant bradyarrhythmias, trifascicular blocks and high-degree\nAtrio-ventricular (AV) blocks should be considered for pacemaker therapy.295\nPrior to implanting a conventional pacemaker, the need for an ICD or Cardiac\nResynchronisation Therapy (CRT) device should be considered. K) Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)\nRoutine use of CCBs is not recommended in patients with HFrEF as they do\nnot confer any morbidity or mortality benefit but worsen HF outcomes.296-301\nDiltiazem, verapamil and nifedipine should be avoided.

Surgical procedures include the following:\nA) Revascularisation Procedures\nPatients with CAD and HF may benefit from revascularisation by either PCI\nor CABG, particularly if they have angina and anatomy that is suitable for\nrevascularisation (left main stem or triple vessel disease). The benefit of\nrevascularisation is likely to be more in patients with more severe left\nventricular dysfunction, severe CAD with angina, viable myocardium and\nreversible ischaemia. The STICH extension trial found a lower risk of total mortality in the CABG\ngroup compared to medical therapy in patients with severe HF (LVEF < 35%)\nand significant CAD, after a median follow-up of 9.8 years.325 There was also\na significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and the\ncombined outcome of all cause death and CV hospitalisations in the CABG\ngroup. There was an early risk of mortality following CABG, but benefits of\nCABG was seen after 2 years, and this benefit in favour of CABG was seen\nwhether viability or angina was present or absent.

Compared with HFrEF patients, hospitalisations and deaths in\npatients with HFpEF are more likely to be non-cardiovascular.

Antenatal care\nThe principles of management of HF in pregnancy are similar to that in the\nnon-pregnant state. If the patient is in decompensated HF requiring\ninotropes, she should be transferred to a cardiac centre.402\nC. Labour and delivery\nTiming and mode of delivery should be carefully planned by the multidisciplinary\nteam. In the majority of patients, vaginal delivery with epidural anaesthesia\nis the preferred mode of delivery. \uf06c Caesarean section is indicated:193\n\uf0d8 For obstetric reasons. \uf0d8 In patients on warfarin or who have discontinued their warfarin for < 2\nweeks and who now are in imminent labour. \uf0d8 In patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. \uf06c It is beneficial to shorten the second stage of labour by forceps or vacuum\nassisted delivery.193\n\uf0d8 Left lateral decubitus position is preferred to attenuate the haemodynamic\neffects in the supine position. \uf0d8 A slow i.v infusion of oxytocin immediately after birth, (2 U of oxytocin\ngiven over 10 min followed by 12 mU/min for 4 h) reduces the risk of\npost partum haemorrhage and has a minimal impact on cardiovascular\nparameters.418\n\uf06c Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in patients with valvular\nheart disease undergoing uncomplicated vaginal delivery or Caesarean\nsection. D. Post partum care\nAfter delivery, careful monitoring of haemodynamic status should be done for\nat least 24 hours, or longer in high risk patients. In patients with severe\ncardiac lesions, haemodynamics may be abnormal up to 10 days after delivery.193\nThese patients should be evaluated post partum to assess the need for\ncorrective surgery. The risk of recurrence of HF in subsequent pregnancies should also be made\nknown to the patient. Follow-up visit at 6 weeks post partum should be attended by the\nmultidisciplinary team, a full cardiac assessment should be done, and appropriate\ncontraception should be advised. 8.5.3 HEART FAILURE IN ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE (ACHD)\nAdult congenital heart disease (ACHD) includes patients who are born with\ncongenital heart disease (CHD) and survived to adulthood (age 18 years and\nabove).

The degree of dysfunction correlates with the\nduration as well as rate of the tachyarrhythmia. Recognition of this entity is important clinically, as treatment of the underlying\narrhythmia can result in either partial or complete recovery of LV function\nwhich, in turn, would result in an improvement in morbidity and mortality.433,434\nArrhythmia suppression should be considered as part of the holistic evaluation\nin treating patients with HF although the underlying mechanisms are not fully\nunderstood.

All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and\nno other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation. Assessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary\nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility. Eligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n\uf06c Poor LVEF (< 25%). \uf06c Recurrent HF hospitalisations. \uf06c Major limitation of the patient\u2019s daily activities. \uf06c Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or\npeak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted).

Patients with refractory\nsymptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered\nfor palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:499\n\uf06c Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in\nmost activities of daily living. \uf06c Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological\nand non-pharmacological therapies. \uf06c Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation\ndespite optimal therapies. \uf06c Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out. \uf06c Cardiac cachexia. \uf06c Clinically judged to be near end of life. The aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to\npromote the best quality of life for patients and their families.500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal\nevidence-based guidance on the care of this population.501 The key components\nof end-of-life care are:\n1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n\uf06c Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such\nas V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \uf06c When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or\nCRT. \uf06c Resuscitation status. \uf06c Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital). 2. Symptom management\nGoals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling\nsymptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n\uf06c Dyspnoea\n\uf06c Fatigue\n\uf06c Pain\n\uf06c Urinary retention\n\uf06c Constipation\n\uf06c Cachexia\n\uf06c Depression\nMedications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,\nopioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. 3. Psychosocial support\nThe impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and\nextends beyond physical symptoms.502\nEmotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient\nanxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end\nof life. 9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT\nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system,\nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and\ncommunity (primary setting).", "chunk_order": 66}

A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient\neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has\nbeen proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general\nphysicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care\nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational\ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two\ndifferent settings:\n\uf06c In the patient\u2019s own home - home-based interventions are associated with\nsignificantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an\nimprovement in the patient\u2019s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible\nin our local setting. \uf06c Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). HFCs can either be:\n\uf06c Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF. \uf06c Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. HFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The\nminimum human resource requirements are a:\n\uf06c Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF,\n\uf06c Dedicated nurse and\n\uf06c Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes\nwalk tests. 9. ORGANISATION OF CARE\nIn bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical\nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable. These clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community\nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n\uf06c Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting\ntime of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time). \uf06c Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification. \uf06c Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications. \uf06c With ICD or CRTs. \uf06c With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD. \uf06c With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n\uf0d8 Heart transplant\n\uf0d8 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n\uf0d8 Palliative care. The objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These\ninclude:507,508\n\uf06c Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of \u03b2-blockers, ACE-I\nand MRA. \uf06c Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its\nprogression. \uf06c Promotion of self-care such as :\n\uf0d8 Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction. \uf0d8 Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and\nbody weight.

Close partnership between\nthese HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to\nhospital. In 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was\nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors\nand other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the\nHeart Failure MTAC are:509\n\uf06c Enhance patient\u2019s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological\ninterventions. \uf06c To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF\npatient due to acute decompensation. \uf06c To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy\nand related issues. \uf06c To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management\nprogram. 9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP\nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve\nto assess a patient\u2019s status, response to therapy, development of complications and\ndisease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n\uf06c Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test\n\uf06c Fluid status and body weight\n\uf06c Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm\n\uf06c Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n\uf06c Cognitive status and nutritional status\n\uf06c Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n\uf06c Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n\uf06c Diet and sodium intake\n\uf06c Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n\uf06c Smoking history. The frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient\u2019s clinical stability and need for\npharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation\nor clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2\nweeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the\nlocal organisation of care and resources. Routine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a\nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might\nsignificantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram\nis reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.

Despite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and\nhealing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National\nCentre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary\nand alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare\ninterventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered\npart of conventional medicine. 10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.510-513 There is\nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. 10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that\ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514\n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a\nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death\nand/or hospitalisations.515,516\nKey message 11:\n\uf06c Heart Failure clinics will serve as an intermediary between in-patient\nhospital care and community primary care. 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for\npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with\nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality\nis not known. 10.6 Yoga\nA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak\nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.520 There is an\nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service\nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25%\nreduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025.", "chunk_order": 69}

Finding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the\nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure\nwe move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical\nexpense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be\nundertaken:\n\uf06c Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country. \uf06c Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care. \uf06c Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost\nand patient outcomes. \uf06c Education of healthcare personnel. Efforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology\nof HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed\ntherapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry\nshould be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit\ngeography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems\nare important. 11. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9,\nPages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general\ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to\nensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel. Incentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF\ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and\ninnovation be made available. This streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully\nwill help in better overall patient care and experience. Performance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient,\nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation. Process performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n\uf06c % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class. \uf06c % of patients who had LVEF measurement. \uf06c % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications\ndischarged with ACE-I/ARB. \uf06c % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications\ndischarged on \u03b2-blockers. \uf06c % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications\ndischarged on MRA. \uf06c % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications\non anticoagulant therapy at discharge. \uf06c % of patients given a post discharge appointment.

Unlike adults with HF, PHF is commonly due to congenital heart disease\n(CHD) or cardiomyopathies. However, the general principles of management\nare similar to those in adults, except that there is a lack of randomised clinical\ntrials and international guidelines for PHF.3\n13.2 Definition\nThere are various definitions of PHF.1,4,5 PHF can be defined as\n\uf06c \u201cThe failure of the heart to supply blood to either systemic or pulmonary\ncirculation at an appropriate rate of flow, or to receive venous return at an\nappropriate filling pressure, resulting in adverse effects on the heart, the\ncirculation, and the patient\u201d4 or\n\uf06c \u201cA clinical and pathophysiologic syndrome that results from ventricular\ndysfunction, volume or pressure overload, alone or in combination that\nleads to characteristic signs and symptoms, and is associated with\ncirculatory, neurohormonal and molecular abnormalities\u201d.5\n13.3 Aetiology\nIn children, cardiac failure is most often due to CHDs and cardiomyopathies.6\n(Table 18, Page 152). Common etiologies are:\n\uf06c At birth - foetal cardiomyopathies, foetal arrhythmias or non-cardiac conditions\n(i.e., perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, hypoglycaemia, and hypocalcaemia). \uf06c Within the first week of life - duct dependent systemic circulation, i.e. closure or restriction of ductus arteriosus leading to a severe reduction of\nend-organ perfusion in patients with critical aortic stenosis (AS), aortic\ncoarctation (CoA), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). \uf06c Within the first year of life - left to right shunts (i.e. large ventricular septal\ndefect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrioventricular septal\ndefect (AVSD), aortopulmonary window (AP window), or cyanotic CHD with\nnon-protective pulmonary blood flow (i.e. transposition great arteries with\nVSD, truncus arteriosus). In both these conditions, pulmonary blood flow\n(PBF) progressively increases with the fall of pulmonary vascular resistance. \uf06c Children and adolescence (1-18 years of age) - more often due to\nrheumatic carditis, myocarditis or cardiomyopathies other than congenital\nheart disease. 13.4 Clinical Presentation\nThe clinical presentation of HF varies with age. It may present at birth\n(because of foetal disease) or can develop at any stage of childhood. Table\n19, Page 153 summarises the clinical presentation of paediatric HF according\nto the different age groups. The clinical presentation of HF in neonates and infants are non-specific, and\ncardiac murmurs may be absent or very soft. Absence of femoral pulse or\npresence of radio-femoral delay may suggest coarctation of aorta. Hence, it is very important to exclude underlying cardiac disease in younger\ninfants with feeding difficulties, respiratory distress, and growth failure. Furthermore, features of HF in adults such as ankle oedema are rarely seen\nin infants and children. The severity of HF is staged based on modified Ross classification as shown\nin Table 20, Page 153. Briefly, class 1 is absence of symptoms and class 4 is\nsevere symptoms of HF.", "chunk_order": 114}

The severity of HF is staged based on modified Ross classification as shown\nin Table 20, Page 153. Briefly, class 1 is absence of symptoms and class 4 is\nsevere symptoms of HF. Acute heart failure in children may present with hypotension or tachycardia\nwith narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, and irritable or decreased\nconsciousness. It is usually seen in cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, and left\nventricular outflow tract obstructions such as critical/severe aortic stenosis or\ncoarctation of aorta. 13.5 Diagnosis\nPHF is a clinical diagnosis, and any child presenting with symptoms and\nsigns of HF needs assessment to establish the diagnosis and haemodynamic\nstatus.7 The initial steps of management are non-invasive investigations to\nlook for the aetiology and assess the severity of HF. These include blood investigations, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest\nradiograph, echocardiogram. Occasionally, other investigations such as\ncardiac catheterisation, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT\nscan may be necessary. 13.5.1 Essential investigations (Tables 21 and 22, Pages 154 and 155)\nInitial therapy to reduce pulmonary congestion or to improve perfusion should\nnot be delayed while waiting for the results of the investigations. Chest X-ray (CXR)\nCXR is indicated as the first-line investigation in all children with suspected\nHF. Features to look for are:\n\uf06c Size of the heart (small, normal or, large) -\n\uf0d8 In the neonate and small infant, the thymic shadow may be confused\nas cardiomegaly. In these cases, a lateral CXR may be helpful. \uf0d8 The incidental finding of cardiomegaly in asymptomatic infants would\nwarrant further investigations with an echocardiogram. \uf06c Contours of the heart\n\uf06c Pulmonary vascularity (increase, normal, and decrease)\n\uf06c Signs of fluid overload such as cardiomegaly, septal lines (or Kerley B\nlines), and pleural effusions. ECG\n\uf06c The ECG is always abnormal in children with HF. However, the findings\nare generally non-specific - e.g. sinus tachycardia and left ventricular\nhypertrophy. \uf06c ECG may be diagnostic in HF secondary to tachy - or bradyarrhythmias\n(e.g. supraventricular tachycardia, atrial ectopic tachycardia, heart block). \uf06c A continuous ECG monitoring (Holter) is indicated in any patient presenting\nwith unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy for possible tachycardia-induced\ncardiomyopathy. 2D-echocardiogram\nThis will provide information on:\n\uf06c Structural cardiac defects (volume or pressure overload),\n\uf06c Chamber sizes (dilated left atrium and ventricle in left to right shunt), and\n\uf06c Cardiac function (a poor cardiac function with dilated left ventricle in\nmyocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathies. 13.6 Management\nThe therapeutic approach should be tailored to the clinical status at presentation\nand the underlying cause of HF.

(Table 23, Page 156). Treatment goals are:\n\uf06c Treat the underlying problem, i.e., corrective surgery/intervention in a\nchild with significant left-right lesions,\nI,C\nI,C\n\uf06c Minimise morbidity and mortality, and\n\uf06c Improve functional status and quality of life. Children with decompensated HF are preferably managed in an intensive\ncare unit for stabilisation. General principles of management include:\n\uf06c Oxygen therapy in acute HF. \uf06c Correcting acidosis, hypoglycaemia, and anaemia. \uf06c Correcting electrolyte disturbances. \uf06c Treating respiratory infections. \uf06c Nasogastric tube feeding in children with poor weight gain. \uf06c Treating gastroesophageal reflux. \uf06c Adequate nutritional intake. \uf06c Fluids should be carefully administered - symptoms may be related to\nfluid overload, under perfusion or both. Therefore, the goal of therapy is\nto return the patient to a euvolemic state with good perfusion. \uf06c Anaemia should be treated cautiously. If indicated, blood transfusion\nshould be given in small volumes (5-10ml/kg) to avoid worsening\nsymptoms. Following stabilisation, efforts should be made to identify and treat the underlying\ncause. All treatable structural heart defects should have corrective surgery\nand/or interventional therapy as early as possible. In cases of HF due to cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, long-term medical\ntherapy is necessary. Common medications include: (Table 24, Page 157)\n\uf06c Loop diuretics - frusemide\n\uf0d8 Indicated in the treatment of HF due to volume overload. \uf0d8 In decompensated HF, a slow intravenous infusion of frusemide\nwould avoid worsening the hypotension as compared to intermittent\nbolus injections.8\n\uf0d8 The addition of spironolactone (potassium sparing) avoids the need\nfor potassium supplements. It has the additional beneficial effect of\nattenuating the development of aldosterone-induced myocardial\nfibrosis and catecholamine release.9\n\uf0d8 In euvolemic patients, diuretics should be used judiciously.
