Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were issued in 2015 and will be reviewed in 2019 or\nsooner if new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating,\nthe Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty\nwill be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for\na revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary\nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used\nby MaHTAS will be employed.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee\n(RC) during the process of the CPG development. The previous CPG entitled Management of Cervical Cancer 2003\nwas used as the basis for the development of the present guidelines. A literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N); Medline via Ovid,\nPubmed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR). Refer\nto Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria\nare all literature on women with cervical cancer, regardless of study\ndesign. The search was limited to literature published in the last ten\nyears and on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of\nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further identify\nrelevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify\nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 11 Jan 2013 to 20\nFeb 2013. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions\nat the end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant\npapers published before 28 February 2015 to be included. Future CPG\nupdates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The\ndetails of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the\nCPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to other CPG on cervical cancer developed\nby Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) 2008. The CPG\nwas evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.

The CPG\nwas evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. A total of 13 clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG members met 26 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. These CPG are\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. Management of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nThe literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). On completion, the draft guideline was reviewed by external reviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback\nfrom any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the\nTechnical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council\nMoH Malaysia for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nCervical cancer remains an important health issue among women in\nMalaysia. Despite numerous screening programmes for early detection\nof pre-invasive disease of the cervix, many women have been diagnosed\nat invasive stage of cervical cancer. This has tremendous implications\nto the patients, carers and healthcare system. The first edition of CPG on Management of Cervical Cancer was\npublished in 2003. Many new development especially in the treatment\nof the condition has emerged which lead to variation in clinical practice. Based on these, the CPG have been updated using a systematic review\nmethodology. It aims to guide healthcare providers on the evidencebased management of invasive cervical cancer in the Malaysian\nhealthcare setting. 2. EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThere is an increasing trend of cancer worldwide. A total of 14.1 million\nnew cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths occurred in 2012,\ncompared to 12.7 million and 7.6 million respectively in 2008. Cervical\ncancer is the fifth (3.7%) common cause of cancer following prostate\n(7.9%), colorectal (9.7%), breast (11.9%) and lung cancer (13.0%)\nglobally. It is the fourth (7.9%) common cause of cancer among women\nafter breast (25.2%), colorectal (9.2%) and lung cancer (8.8%). Seventy\npercent of cervical cancer cases occur in low resourced countries.1, level III\nIn Malaysia, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer\namong women following breast cancer.1 - 2, level III The age-standardised\nrate is highest among Indians (10.3/100,000) followed by Chinese\n(9.5/100,000) and Malays (5.3/100,000). The rate increases after 30\nyears of age and peaks at 65 - 69 years. Among all cancer deaths,\ncervical cancer ranked fifth.3, level III\nIn the United States, a declining overall incidence of cervical cancer\nhas been reported; largely attributed to the decrease in the incidence\nof squamous cell carcinoma. However, there is an unexplained rise of\nadenocarcinoma (AC).4, level II-2 There is no published local data on the\ntrend of cervical cancer. Management of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\n3. RISK FACTORS\nThe primary cause of cervical cancer is infection with certain types of\nHuman Papilloma Virus (HPV) which is transmitted sexually. Multiple\nrisk factors are associated with the development of the cancer:\n\u2022 >3 sexual partners5, level II-2\n\u2022 early sexual intercourse (<17 years old)5, level II-2\n\u2022 >10 years\u2019 use of oral contraceptive5, level II-2\n\u2022 first delivery before age of 176, level II-2\n\u2022 high parity (\u22657 full term pregnancies)6, level II-2\n\u2022 smoking6 - 7, level II-2\n\u2022 lower socioeconomic status8, level II-2\n4.

Meticulous and accurate reporting\nof gross pathological and histological parameters determine treatment\nand prognosis of the patients. Regular tumour board meetings are also\nadvocated to optimise patient management decisions.14, level III\nThere are numerous independent histopathologic prognostic factors\nwhich are important in determining the patient\u2019s management, which\nincludes lymph node status (p=0.0004), parametrial invasion (p=0.016),\nlymph vascular space invasion (LVSI), p=0.046) and histology of pure\nAC (p=0.012).15, level III\nThe presence of LVSI must be recorded for tumours of all types and\nstages.

Management of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\n7. STAGING\na. Clinical Staging\nStaging of cervical cancer plays an important role in determining further\ninvestigations and treatment as well as survival of patients. Hence, an\nadequate and appropriate staging is an integral part of management for\nthese patients. There are two commonly used staging systems for cervical cancer\nnamely FIGO staging19, level III and TNM classification.20, level III The latest\nrevised FIGO staging of 2009 is currently the standard staging system\nused in Malaysia for all histological types (refer to Appendix 5). FIGO staging is based on clinical examination. A thorough pelvic\nexamination with/without anaesthesia is mandatory to provide\ninformation for the staging. When there is doubt as to which stage a\nparticular cancer should be allocated, the lower stage is assigned.19, level III\nThe office pelvic examination has a weak but significant correlation\nwith the actual extent of disease in determination of vaginal (r=0.255,\np<0.01) and parametrial invasion (r=0.174, p<0.01). The overall\naccuracy is 70.4% for vaginal involvement and 74.5% for parametrial\ndisease. It also has high accuracy in early FIGO stage cervical cancer\n(85.4% for stage IB1 and 77.4% for stage IB2) but low accuracy in\nFIGO stage II (35.5% for stage IIA and 20.5% for stage IIB).22, level III\nThe following examinations are permitted for the determination of FIGO\nstaging, as indicated by presenting characteristics: palpation, inspection,\ncolposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy,\nintravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton. Blood tests should include full blood count, renal and liver function tests. Syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus serology need to be\nconsidered based on discussion with the patient about risk factors.21, level III\n\u2022 Initial assessment of microinvasive disease\n\uf0a1 Assessment of FIGO stage IA\nDiagnosis of both Stage IA1 and IA2 should be based on microscopic\nexamination of excised tissue, including cone biopsy with negative\nmargins, trachelectomy or hysterectomy. If the margins of the cone\nbiopsy are positive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III or invasive\ncancer, a second cone biopsy should be performed or the patient\ntreated as FIGO stage IB1 disease.21, level III\n\uf0a1 Assessment of FIGO stage IB and above\nBiopsy of the visible lesions is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of\ncervical cancer. Management of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nChest X-ray and evaluation of hydronephrosis are mandatory in\ngrossly invasive disease. Evaluation of hydnonephrosis can be done\nusing renal ultrasound, intravenous urography, computed tomography\n(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).", "chunk_order": 9}

Evaluation of hydnonephrosis can be done\nusing renal ultrasound, intravenous urography, computed tomography\n(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The bladder and rectum\nare evaluated by cystoscopy and sigmoidoscopy only if the patient\nis clinically symptomatic. The presence of bullous oedema alone on\nthe bladder or rectal mucosa should not be assigned as FIGO stage\nIV. Suspected bladder or rectal involvement should be confirmed\nhistologically.21, level III\nCT and/or MRI with/without positron emission tomography (PET) may\nprovide information on nodal status or systemic spread but are not\nmandatory.21, level III Refer to section on Radiological Staging for further\ndetails. In our local context, as CT scan is widely available, the CPG DG suggests\nit is a preferred modality as part of the assessment of cervical cancer. In healthcare facilities where this modality is not readily available or if\npatients are not suitable for contrast studies, other modalities such as\nchest X-ray and ultrasound scan may be used. \u2022 The staging of cervical cancer is determined at the time of the\nprimary diagnosis and cannot be altered, even at recurrence. b. Radiological Staging\nIt is important to assess prognostic factors based on radiological\nimaging such as tumour size, parametrial and pelvic side invasion,\nadjacent organ invasion and lymph node metastases to complement\nclinical assessment. Utilisation of different imaging modalities depends\non accessibility, patients\u2019 clinical stage, clinicians\u2019 preference and\ncost, among others. Worldwide, CT and MRI are preferred over other\nmodalities in cervical cancer staging. However, radiological imaging is\nnot included in the revised FIGO staging. In a meta-analysis of eight studies, MRI showed higher sensitivity\ncompared to CT in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) in\nevaluating:23, level III\n\u2022 parametrial invasion: 74% (95% CI 68 to79) vs 55% (95% CI 44 to\n66), p=0.0027\n\u2022 bladder invasion: 75% (95% CI 66 to 83) vs 64% (95% CI 39 to 82)\n\u2022 rectal invasion: 71% (95% CI 53 to 83) vs 45% (95% CI 20 to 73%)\n\u2022 lymph node involvement: 60% (95% CI 52 to 68%) vs 43% (95%\nCI 31 to 57), p=0.047\nHowever, heterogeneity is an issue in this study in terms of equipment\nand techniques used in the primary papers. Management of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nIn a diagnostic study, MRI showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of\n85.7% to 90% in detecting vaginal infiltration and tumour extension to\ncervical stroma with an accuracy of 92.2%.24, level III\nParametrial infiltration is an important parameter in determining\nmanagement options of apparent early stage cervical cancer.", "chunk_order": 10}

Primary Treatment\nSurgery is the preferred modality of treatment for early stage cervical\ncancer, if it is not contraindicated. Similar survival outcomes have been\nreported in surgically treated early stage cervical cancer compared with\nRT.34, level I It also has the advantage of preserving coital and ovarian\nfunction in young patients. i. Surgery\n\u2022 Fertility-preserving surgery\nCervical cancer is the third most common cancer in women younger\nthan 40 years. Up to 42% of all cervical cancers are diagnosed in\nwomen before the age of 45 years, and up to 40% of early cervical\ncancers are diagnosed in young women who are potentially interested\nin a fertility-preserving surgery.35, level III Therefore, simple and radical\ntrachelectomy has been increasingly used.35 - 36, level III\nFertility-preserving surgery may be considered in young patients with\nearly stage cervical cancer. The surgical options include cervical\nconisation, large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ), simple\nand radical trachelectomy via vaginal or abdominal approaches. These\nprocedures may be combined with pelvic lymph nodes dissection\n(PLND). Careful patient selection is important to ensure low complication rates\nand optimal obstetric and oncologic outcomes. Cases should be\nevaluated and managed by experienced gynae-oncologists. Careful\nevaluation of the initial diagnostic specimens from cervical conisation\nor trachelectomy by experienced pathologists is needed.35, level III\nThere is no evidence retrieved specifically for the treatment of FIGO\nstage IA1 cervical cancer.

The recommended total tumour dose in 2 Gy per\nfraction radiobiologic equivalence to Point A is 80 to 90 Gy, depending\non the initial stage of the disease. Earlier RCTs have shown that CCRT is superior to RT alone for LACC. This treatment has been the standard of care for LACC since 1999. Two meta-analyses showed that CCRT improved OS, PFS and\ndisease-free survival compared to RT alone in FIGO stage IB to\nIVA cervical cancer. Most of these trials were using platinum-based\nchemotherapy.51 - 52, level I\nIn a systematic review of limited quality, CCRT caused significant\nincrease of acute haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities and no\nsignificant difference in late toxicities.51, level I In view of the consistent\nsurvival benefit from CCRT, the additional acute toxicities described\nmay be justified.

It is suggested that these bulky\ntumours and the associated tumour hypoxia was better addressed by\nhysterectomy than by additional intra-cavitary radiation. In a large RCT, adjuvant surgery with extrafascial hysterectomy after\nradiation in FIGO stage IB cervical cancer had no clinical benefit\ncompared with no adjuvant surgery. Even though there was a trend\ntowards reduction in progression of disease and death but it was nonsignificant (RR for progression=0.77, p=0.07; RR for death=0.89,\np=0.26). This may be due to lower cumulative incidence of local\nrelapse (14% vs 27%) but higher distant progression (20% vs 16%)\nin the adjuvant surgery group at five years. Further analysis showed a\nManagement of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nsignificant 28% reduction in progression of disease in bigger tumours\n(4 to 6 cm) in the adjuvant surgery group. The rates of grade 3 and 4\nadverse events were similar at 10% in both group.57, level I\nIn cervical cancer patients with localised residual disease after primary\nradiation therapy, adjuvant hysterectomy is an effective salvage\nprocedure even in patients with FIGO stage III disease and in those\nwith non-SCC. The 5-year survival rate in the adjuvant surgery group is\nsignificantly higher than the group without adjuvant surgery (68.6% vs\n14.5%). Apart from that:58, level II-2\n\u2022 there is no difference in survival between SCC and non-SCC\n(p=0.6862). \u2022 there is a trend for better survival of smaller tumours compared\nwith larger tumours, although non-significant (p=0.053). Adjuvant hysterectomy after unsuccessful ICBT does not offer advantage\nin recurrence-free and survival nor increase late toxicity.59, level II-2\n\u2022 50% of patients treated with pelvic EBRT alone have recurrent\ndisease, whereas none among adjuvant hysterectomy patients\n(p=0.068). \u2022 43% of patients treated with pelvic EBRT alone have died of\ndisease recurrence, whereas none among adjuvant hysterectomy\npatients (p=0.152). \u2022 No patients develop late toxicity such as fistulae, wound\ndehiscence or bowel stenosis.

Acute radiation complication refers to radiation-induced injury\nduring the time of treatment and for up to 90 days after completion of\nRT. This is a frequently occurring early adverse effect and the pathology\nis of an in\ufb02ammatory process affecting the rectal or bladder mucosa,\nand is generally self-limiting. Late radiation complications are complications occurring more than 90\ndays after completing radiotherapy treatment and are relatively rare. The underlying pathology is of submucosal injury with a combination of\n\ufb01brosis, ischaemia, and subsequent ulceration, which can be localised,\ndiffuse or full thickness penetrating the wall of the rectum. The\nclinical presentation may have an in\ufb02ammatory component producing\ntenesmus, urgency, diarrhoea, constipation, anal sphincter dysfunction\n(affecting the control of the bowels), mucoid or bloody discharge per\nrectum or frank bleeding with ulceration which may perforate. These\nchronic and episodic symptoms will cause impaired QOL of the patients.

There is no recent evidence on the above issues and thus\nthe CPG DG has decided to use the best available evidence beyond\nthe scope of the search. a. Radiation Proctitis\nLate radiation proctitis is episodic and variable in nature. A Cochrane\nsystematic review on non-surgical interventions for the management of\nlate radiation proctitis had identified several treatment approaches with\nvarying results.100, level I\n\u2022 Rectal sucralfate showed greater clinical improvement for proctitis\nthan anti-inflammatories (OR=14, 95% CI 1.46 to 134.26),\nthough no difference was seen for endoscopic improvement\n(OR=2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.76).

Management of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nb. Radiation Cystitis\nLate radiation cystitis is relatively uncommon treatment complication. The same Cochrane systematic review found no evidence from trials\ndetermining the effects of non-surgical treatments for late radiation\ncystitis. Therefore, there is no standard treatment in managing patients\nwith radiation cystitis.100, level I\n\u2022 There is insufficient good quality evidence to recommend treatment\nfor late radiation proctitis and cystitis in cervical cancer. Therefore,\nthe treatment should be individualised according to the attending\ndoctor. c. Lymphoedema\nRefer to Chapter on Palliative Care (Lymphoedema). d. Chronic Bladder Dysfunction\nIt is a common late complication of radical hysterectomy ranging\nfrom 0-44% and the most distressing one, requiring voiding by the\nclock with the help of abdominal muscles and in some cases, selfcatheterisation.101\nRadicality of the surgery is closely related to post-operative bladder\ndysfunction.

Anticoagulation\nshould be continued indefinitely or until cancer is resolved.117\nCurrently, there is insufficient evidence on the usage of novel\nanticoagulants (such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban) in the management\nof VTE in cancer patients.115, level I\nMechanism of VTE in Cancer Patients\nTumour-associated\n\u2022 Extrinsic vascular compression and\ninvasion\n\u2022 Tissue factor production\n\u2022 Cancer pro-coagulant production\n\u2022 Accentuated platelet activation\n\u2022 Inflammation-mediated increases in\nfactor VIII, vWF and fibrinogen\n\u2022 Impaired fibrinolysis due to high PAI-1\n\u2022 Acquired deficiencies of natural\nanticoagulants\nNon-tumour associated\n\u2022 Central venous access devices\n\u2022 Anti-neoplastic mediated platelet\nactivation\n\u2022 Anti-neoplastic mediated\nendothelial cell damage\n\u2022 Anti-angiogenesis therapy\n\u2022 Anthracycline-induced congestive\nheart failure\n\u2022 Immobility\nManagement of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nMore than 50% of cancer patients have renal insufficiency, in turn\naffecting treatment choices and dosages.

Palliative\nsurgical interventions may be inappropriate if patients are terminally\nill with irreversible renal failure. The high morbidity associated with\npalliative diversion may impair QOL. Treatment decisions should be\nbased on clear discussions of options, prognosis, cost, complications\nand QOL, between patients and a multidisciplinary team.126, level II-2\ng. Malignant Bowel Obstruction\nThe incidence of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) in gynaecologic\ncancer appears to be commonest in ovarian cancer (54.5%), followed\nby cervical or endometrial cancer (27.3%).127, level II-3 Patients often have\nhigh morbidity due to symptoms such as abdominal pain, colic, nausea\nand vomiting, as well as from treatment such as surgery, nasogastric\ntube insertion and intravenous therapy. Management of MBO should be tailored to the underlying aetiology,\nstage of disease and goals of care. Treatment options may include\nsurgical management with corrective or non-corrective laparotomies,\nventing tubes and stent insertions, or medical management such as\nsymptomatic relief with opioids, anti-emetics, anti-spasmodics, antisecretory drugs and steroids.104, level III\nIn patients with advanced gynaecologic cancers who present with MBO,\ntreatment with dexamethasone (6 - 16 mg/day) may resolve bowel\nobstruction but will not improve survival. A therapeutic trial of four to\nfive days is suggested.128, level I Octreotide may be considered in these\npatients, and will reduce overall nausea, vomiting and nasogastric\ndrainage volume.127, level II-3\nThere are no clear recommendations for surgery in resolving symptoms\nof MBO in advanced gynaecologic cancer.128, level I Consider medical\nManagement of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nmanagement for patients with advanced stage cancer and a shorter\ntime interval between cancer diagnosis and bowel obstructions.129, level III\nh.

They also experience lower pleasure and QOL, higher discomfort and\nhigher levels of depression and anxiety, than those without chronic\nfatigue.133, level III\nSexual dysfunction is a common problem after cervical cancer treatment. Many factors contribute to this including the loss of psychologic selfesteem, distorted physical appearance, or deterioration of organ\nfunction. Although most women resume sexual activity after radical\nhysterectomy, 41% of them have decreased sexual satisfaction while\n36% have increased dyspareunia.134, level III Physical intimacy and body\nimage are highly vulnerable to disruption after cancer diagnosis and\ntreatment.135, level I\nPatients should be advised that their physical and psychological\nfunctions are likely to deteriorate in the initial post-treatment period, but\nthey should anticipate improvement thereafter.17\nRecommendation 19\n\u2022 Psychosocial assessment should be performed in all cervical cancer\npatients. \u2022 Psychoeducation regarding potential deterioration and treatment\noutcome-related to the cervical cancer should be offered after\ndiagnosis. \u2022 The sexual health of women diagnosed with cervical cancer should\nbe assessed pre-treatment and monitored during the treatment. Women with cervical cancer require help for various needs. These\nneeds should be identified early so that resources and intervention\ncan be put in place as promptly as possible.132, level III Many women\nManagement of Cervical Cancer (Second Edition)\nreport an increase need for emotional and physical closeness with their\nspouse.135, level I\nSome women show concern about their sexual health, which include:134, level III\n\u2022 potential harm from sexual activity on health\n\u2022 appropriate time to resume sexual activity\n\u2022 ways to relieve pelvic pain or increase sexual desire\n\u2022 self-awareness of being feminine\nSeveral psychological interventions for patients with cervical cancers\nhave been evaluated. Couple-focused intervention has stronger effects\ncompared to women-focused intervention. It improves most sexual\naspects including adjustment, drive, satisfaction and intimacy. It also has\nstrong effects for the male partners\u2019 sexual drive and satisfaction.135, level I\nOther psychological interventions with some positive effects:\n\u2022 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy on changing unhelpful thoughts or\nbehaviour and coping skills.136, level I\n\u2022 counselling on emotional distress including anxiety and depression.", "chunk_order": 35}
