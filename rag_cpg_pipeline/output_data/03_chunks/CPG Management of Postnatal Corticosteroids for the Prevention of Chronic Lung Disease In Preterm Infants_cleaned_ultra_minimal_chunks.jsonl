BPD is commonly defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of|\nage. Some definitions also include X-ray evidence of BPD or history of\n\u2018mechanical ventilation in the fst week of life.\"\u201d One ofthe weaknesses of\nthis definition isthatits very common for very preterm infants below 28 weeks\n\u2018estaion to require oxygen for more than 28 days and most of these are\n\u2018normal, Chronic lung disease (CLD) generally refers tinfans below 32 weeks\n\u2018who remain oxygen dependent at 36 weeks postmensral age. This definition\nhhasben found to bea more accurate predictor of long term outcome. Inthe\nclinical sting the terms are often used interchangeably. This guideline wsesthe\ntermCLD and refers either definition above: thatis oxygen dependeney at\n28 daysof life oF a 36 weeks postmenstrual age. wm\nHowever defined, chronic lung disease is an important problem. Severe cases\n!have pulmonary hypertension and progress to cor pulmonale whichis usually\nfatal. The treatment of CLD is costly. Most infants require a prolonged hospital\nsay and some continue with home oxygen therapy after discharge. Infans with\nCLD require more frequent hospital admission and havea higher tsk of dying\nduring the first year of life. Poor growth and abnormal neurological\n{development are additional problems that these infants may fae. 2. Incidence\n\u2018The incidence of CLD depends onthe definition. Inthe Malaysian Paediatric\nAssociation Very Low Bin Weight (VLBW) sty, 4% of 962 VLBW infants\n\u2018born in 20 Malaysian hospitals were oxygen dependant at 28 days and had\nX-ray evidence of BPD while 28% died and 689% were normal.\u201d In\ndeveloped countries where the morality is lower BPD has reported in 11 10\n'57% of survivors\"! Survival of VLBW infants is rapidly improving in\nMalaysia and it is reasonable to assume that CLD will become more\n3.

Conclusion\n\u2018The reviewers of the review recommend further follow up studies but in the\n\u2018mean time conclude thatthe benefits of early postnatal steroids may not\n\u2018outweigh te risks.
