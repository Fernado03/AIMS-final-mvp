The guideline should not override the responsibility of\nthe practitioners to make decision appropriate to the circumstances of\nthe individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and\ntheir families or guardians, taking into account the management options\navailable locally. UPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2023 and will be reviewed in a minimum\nperiod of four years (2027) or sooner if there is a need to do so. When\nit is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of\nthe related specialty will be informed about it. A discussion will be done\non the need for a revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A\nmultidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review\nmethodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA\n\u2022 Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus should be based on\nclinical manifestations supported by laboratory findings following\nexclusion of alternative diagnoses. PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT\n\u2022 All patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should have\nclinical assessment of disease activity; this may be done using the\nvalidated assessment tools for SLE. TREATMENT\n\u2022 Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should practise\nsun avoidance, use protective clothing and broad-spectrum\nsunscreen with at least sun protection factor (SPF) 50. \u2022 Corticosteroids should be used for acute flare in SLE; the dose should\nbe minimised accordingly and discontinued whenever possible. \u2022 All patients with SLE should be on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) unless\nintolerant or contraindicated. \u2022 Immunosuppressants should be considered as add-on therapy to\npatients with SLE not responding to HCQ alone or in combination with\ncorticosteroids, or when corticosteroids doses cannot be tapered. \u2022 Cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil may be used as\ninduction therapy in certain major organ involvement in SLE. \u2022 Biologics may be used as an adjunct therapy in active SLE despite\nstandard therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. MONITORING\n\u2022 All patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be\nmonitored based on clinical and laboratory parameters. \u2022 Patients with SLE should be screened for cardiovascular risk factors\nand osteoporosis. \u2022 Infection in patients with SLE should be identified early and treated\naccordingly. iii\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATION\n\u2022 All women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the\nreproductive age group should receive pre-pregnancy counselling. \u2022 In SLE with pregnancy, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, calcineurin\ninhibitors and low dose corticosteroids should be continued. \u2022 Low dose aspirin should be initiated in all pregnant SLE patients\nunless intolerance or contraindicated. \u2022 Vaccination status and indications for further vaccinations of patients\nwith SLE should be assessed yearly. GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the DG for these CPG were from the Ministry of\nHealth (MoH) and the Ministry of Higher Education.

GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the DG for these CPG were from the Ministry of\nHealth (MoH) and the Ministry of Higher Education. There was active\ninvolvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the\nprocess of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: mainly Medline via Ovid and others\ne.g. Pubmed (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The inclusion criteria are all adults at risk and with systemic lupus\nerythematous (SLE) regardless of study design. The first search was\nlimited to literature published in the last 13 years (2009 until 2022)\nfor all clinical questions, on humans and in English. In addition, the\nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to\nfurther identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted\nfor studies related to the issues addressed. All searches were\nconducted from 21 February 2022 to 21 October 2022. The literature\nsearch was repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG\ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before 1\nJuly 2023 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence\npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can\nbe obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. The DG members\ntake note that new documents on SLE by EULAR and Antiphospholipid\nSyndrome Classification Criteria by ACR/EULAR have been published\nrecently after the cut-off date for retrieval of evidence of this MoH CPG. References were also made to other guidelines on SLE as listed below:\n\u2022 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology - 2019\nupdate of the EULAR recommendations for the management of\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (2019 update)\n\u2022 British Society for Rheumatology - The British Society for\nRheumatology guideline for the management of systemic lupus\nerythematosus in adults (2018)\n\u2022 van Vollenhoven RF, Mosca M, Bertsias G, et al. - Treat-to-target\nin systemic lupus erythematosus: recommendations from an\ninternational task force (2014)\nA total of 11 main clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG members met 24 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meeting. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC.

The CPG was based\nlargely on the findings of systematic reviews/meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2015) while the\ngrading of recommendation was done using the principles of GRADE\nas much as possible (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the\nCPG followed strictly the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II. Upon completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers.

INTRODUCTION\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune\nmultisystem disorder with diverse and complex clinical manifestations\ncharacterised by inflammation in a variety of organs. The exact aetiology\nis unknown but genetic, hormonal and environmental factors have been\nimplicated. This disease has a relapsing-remitting course with a very\nunpredictable prognosis and considerable morbidity. The survival rates of patients with SLE have increased over the past\nfew decades.1, level II-2 These may be due to early disease detection,\nadvancements in medical treatment and improved management of comorbidities. There was considerable variation in survival rates across the countries\nin Asia-Pacific region. The 5-year survival rates ranged from 60%\namong the Aborigines in Australia, 80% in Malaysia, 94% in South\nKorea and 98% in China (Shanghai), while 10-year survival rates\nranged from 64% in Japan to 94% in Hong Kong.2, level II-2 The leading\ncauses of death among patients with SLE were infections and active\ndisease predominantly in lupus nephritis (LN).3, level II-2\nPatients with SLE commonly experience flares during the disease\ncourse which may have adverse impacts on the short- and long-term\noutcomes. The treat-to-target recommendations for SLE emphasises\non targeting remission, preventing organ damage, minimising comorbidities and drug toxicity, and improving health-related quality of\nlife.4\nManagement of SLE in the Asian population remains a challenge due\nto limited access to health care, delayed diagnosis and poor treatment\nadherence.5 The goal of this first national CPG on Management of\nSLE is to raise awareness among healthcare providers on early SLE\ndetection, prompt referral to rheumatology services and initiation of\ntreatment, mainly for non-renal SLE. The purpose of this CPG is to\nreduce the variation in practices and address resource implications\nin the management of SLE. This will encourage close cooperation\nbetween various stakeholders to enhance quality of life and outcomes\nof the affected patients through evidence-based management. 2. RISK FACTORS\nAlthough the aetiology of SLE is multifactorial and not fully understood,\nidentifying the risk factors associated with the development of SLE can\nhelp in predicting the probability of the disease in a patient. a.", "chunk_order": 6}

RISK FACTORS\nAlthough the aetiology of SLE is multifactorial and not fully understood,\nidentifying the risk factors associated with the development of SLE can\nhelp in predicting the probability of the disease in a patient. a. Gender\nSLE is more commonly diagnosed in women than men worldwide, with\nan incidence ranging from 1.4 to 5.4 cases per 100,000 population\nvs 0.4 to 0.8 cases per 100,000 population in men.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nThe diagnosis of SLE is based on a combination of clinical and\nlaboratory findings indicative of immune reactivity or inflammation in\nvarious organs. There are many mimickers for SLE that should be\nexcluded before arriving at the diagnosis of the disease. In a retrospective cohort study on SLE, the most frequent initial presenting\nsymptoms were musculoskeletal, followed by mucocutaneous and\nneurological. The median time from first musculoskeletal symptom to\nSLE diagnosis was 26.4 months (IQR 9.3, 43.6). Sub-group analysis\nshowed that the younger patients <30 years with severe disease had\nthe shortest time to the diagnosis.16, level II-2\nCommon presentations include mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal,\nhaematological and renal manifestations. The clinical manifestations of\nSLE are illustrated in Figure 1.

The spot urine UPCR or 24hUP may be used to quantify\nproteinuria. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines state\nthat findings for LN are:18\n\uf0a1 persistent proteinuria >0.5 in UPCR or >0.5 g/day in 24hUP or\nurine dipstick \u22653+\n\uf0a1 active urinary sediment (defined as >5 red blood cells [RBCs]\nper high power field [hpf]; >5 white blood cells [WBCs]/hpf in\nthe absence of infection or cellular casts limited to RBC or WBC\ncasts)\n\u2022\nLiver function tests\nThe standard liver function test (LFT) includes measurement of\ntransaminases and serum albumin.

DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA\nThere is no diagnostic criteria for SLE. Classification criteria has been\nused as a guide to identify several salient clinical features in establishing\nthe diagnosis.

It is followed by additive weighted criteria grouped in seven clinical\nand three immunological domains. Each criterion in both domains is\nweighted from 2 to 10.

PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT\nDue to its multisystem involvement, SLE may present with a myriad of\npossible clinical manifestations, making it a challenge to diagnose and\ntreat. \u2022 Principles of SLE treatment are to achieve:\n\uf0a1 disease remission\n\uf0a1 disease flare prevention\n\uf0a1 organ damage prevention\n\uf0a1 quality of life improvement\n\uf0a1 minimisation of drug side effects\n\u2022 If complete remission cannot be achieved, the lowest possible\ndisease activity in all organs involved should be targeted. 6.1 Disease Assessment\nPatients with SLE may have a fluctuating disease course or persistently\nactive disease despite being on medications. Both persistent disease\nactivity and disease flares can contribute to irreversible damage and\nimpact health-related quality of life. The principal goal of SLE treatment\naccording to the \u2018treat-to-target\u2019 approach emphasises minimisation of\ndisease activity.4 Achieving remission in SLE is desirable but not always\nattainable, hence low disease activity state is an acceptable alternative. SLE flare is generally defined as any increase in disease activity\nleading to intensification of therapy. It refers to a measurable\nincrease in disease activity in one or more organ systems involving\nnew or worsening clinical signs and symptoms and/or laboratory\nmeasurements.", "chunk_order": 12}

It must also be considered clinically significant to\nwarrant adjustment of treatment.38, level III\nDisease activity in SLE can be measured as clinical activity (inflammation\nof organs) or serological activity (elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies or\nlow complements levels). In clinical practice, disease activity in SLE\ncan be evaluated by assessment of symptoms, signs and laboratory\ntests including serology. There are many disease activity assessment\ntools in SLE, however these were created mainly for clinical trials.

TREATMENT\n7.1 Non-Pharmacological Treatment\nThere is limited evidence on the non-pharmacological treatment of SLE. a. Sun protection\nSunlight can induce or exacerbate SLE in a wide variety of cutaneous\nmanifestations including discoid lupus erythematosus and acute CLE. These conditions may lead to physical and psychological burden to\npatients. Two guidelines recommend the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen for\neffective protection against ultraviolet exposure.21; 50 This is supported\nby a systematic review that showed application of sunscreen with sun\nprotection factor (SPF) 50 - 75 reduced lesion development in the\nsetting of photo-provocation among patients with CLE.51, level I\nIn addition, patient should be advised on sun avoidance and the use of\nprotective clothing.21\nb. Nurse-led care\nPatients with SLE face a unique set of challenges due to the variability of\nthe symptoms experienced. Nurses play an important role in addressing\nthese challenges by providing a multitude of nurse-led interventions such\nas patient educational sessions, counselling, exercise and transitional\ncare programs. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) among patients\nwith SLE showed that transitional care programmes led by specialist\nnurses compared with usual care group had significant improvement in\npatient self-care and quality of life as well as reduction in readmission\nrate up to 90 days.52, level I\nc.

Drug treatment is individualised according to the clinical presentation of\nthe disease and the varying disease activity. Corticosteroids are the\ncornerstone treatment in SLE, with immunosuppressants being the\ngold standard treatment for major organ involvement. The initial period\nof intensive immunosuppressive treatment, also known as induction\ntherapy, aims at halting immunological activity especially when there\nis high disease activity or major organ involvement. This is followed\nby a less aggressive maintenance treatment to consolidate remission\nand reduce risk of disease flare. Drugs used in the treatment of SLE\nmay have AEs which require close monitoring for toxicity. Minimum\nlong-term treatment is necessary to maintain remission or low disease\nactivity. Treatment should be based on a shared decision-making\nprocess between the patient and the clinician. Refer to Appendix 7 for Medication in SLE. a. Corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties with rapid onset of\naction that is useful in mild to severe SLE. Although there is no new\nretrievable evidence on its effectiveness, it remains the cornerstone\nof SLE treatment despite advances in immunosuppressive drugs and\ntherapeutic protocols, and development of new drugs.56, level III\nLong-term use of corticosteroids may lead to various AEs. In a large\ncohort of SLE patients in Taiwan, the common AEs and their incidence\nrate are shown below.57, level II-2\nA meta-analysis of eight small RCTs looked into rate of AEs related\nto medium to high dose of corticosteroids in patients with SLE.

Few guidelines provide\nrecommendations on monitoring disease activity, disease damage and\nquality of life.21; 50; 88 - 89\nThe clinical manifestations of SLE may be related to disease activity,\norgan damage, drug toxicity and quality of life. The monitoring includes\nnew clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations, disease activity,\norgan damage, co-morbidities and drug AEs. 9.1 Clinical Features\nSLE can present in various clinical manifestations (refer to Figure 1). Thus, a thorough history and physical examination must be undertaken\nat each clinic visit.

Urinalysis can be used to detect early\nrenal manifestations. Renal biopsy is indicated during monitoring of patients with SLE with\nthe presence of these criteria:21; 23\n\uf0a1 persistent proteinuria >0.5 g/day or >3+ if quantitation not\nperformed\n\uf0a1 cellular casts: presence of red cell, haemoglobin, granular, tubular\nor mixed\nLFT can be deranged due to autoimmune liver disease or liver toxicity\nsecondary to the use of immunosuppressants.

Definite APS fulfilling at least one clinical and one laboratory\ncriteria of the Sapporo Classification Criteria can occur in association\nwith other autoimmune diseases mainly SLE (secondary APS) or in\nits primary form (primary APS).100 Refer to Appendix 9 on Sapporo\nClassification Criteria. The aPL profile determines the risk of thrombotic and obstetric events. The profile is defined according to:100\n\u2022 aPL type\n\u2022 presence of multiple (double or triple) vs single aPL\n\u2022 titre (moderate to high vs low)\n\u2022 persistence of aPL positivity\nHigh-risk aPL profile refers to persistently positive medium/high titres\nor multiple positivity.100 EULAR guidelines recommends that all patients\nwith SLE should be screened at diagnosis for aPL.23\nIn patients with SLE, 15 - 20% have secondary APS.

REFERRAL\nTimely referral to or consultation with rheumatologists is of utmost\nimportance for confirmation of diagnosis and early initiation of\ntreatment for SLE. Even though rheumatologists are the specialists who\nprimarily care for patients with SLE, co-management with specialists\nin other disciplines (e.g. primary care physicians, nephrologists and\nhaematologists) is equally important. Indications for referral to rheumatologist includes to confirm diagnosis,\nassess disease activity and severity, provide general disease\nmanagement, manage organ involvement or life-threatening disease\nand manage/prevent treatment toxicities. Other specific circumstances\nthat require referral include APS, pregnancy and perioperative\nmanagement.129, level III\nFor moderate to severe organ involvement, patients with SLE will\nrequire multidisciplinary care involving various subspecialties.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of this CPG is important as it helps in providing quality\nhealthcare services based on the best and most recent available\nevidence applied to local scenario and expertise. Various factors and\nresource implications should be considered for the success of the\nuptake in the CPG recommendations. 12.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:\ni)\navailability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies)\nii)\nconferences and updates on management of SLE including\nthose involving professional bodies (e.g. Malaysian Society of\nRheumatology)\niii) Key Performance Indicator on Rheumatology Services monitored\nby MoH (i.e. number of newly presented SLE patients prescribed\nHCQ in the Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic)\niv) public awareness campaigns on SLE (e.g. World Lupus Day in\ncollaboration with Malaysian SLE Association)\nLimiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\ni)\ndifferent levels of care and wide variation in practice due to\nexpertise, facilities and financial constraints\nii)\nlimited awareness and knowledge in management of SLE among\nhealthcare providers\niii) lack of awareness of the disease and its management by the public\niv) no local SLE registry\n12.2 Potential Resource Implications\nEarly diagnosis of SLE may be difficult to establish as the presentations\nare non-specific and it is even more challenging with the presence of\nSLE mimickers. Besides that, the supporting relevant investigations\nmay not be easily accessible in the public primary care especially in\nremote areas. The confirmation of the diagnosis and its assessment\nrequires the specialists\u2019 expert opinion especially the rheumatologists,\nwhere the service is limited nationwide.

There is a compelling\nneed to increase awareness and knowledge on the evidence-based\nmanagement of SLE by ensuring widespread distribution of the CPG\nand reinforcing related training to the healthcare providers. Treatment of SLE can be a daunting task particularly in patients with\nsevere disease and co-morbidities. The assessment of disease severity\nof SLE is thus important in deciding the best management approach as\ninadequate treatment may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Heterogeneity of disease manifestation warrants MDT involvement. Based on the recommendations in the CPG, the need for specialised\ncare and certain expensive medications has resource implications that\nneed to be addressed in the management of SLE.

Vascular thrombosis\u2020\nOne or more clinical episodes\u2021 of arterial, venous or small vessel\nthrombosis\u00a7, in any tissue or organ. Thrombosis must be confirmed\nby objective validated criteria (i.e. unequivocal findings of appropriate\nimaging studies or histopathology). For histopathologic confirmation,\nthrombosis should be present without significant evidence of\ninflammation in the vessel wall. 2. Pregnancy morbidity\n(a) One or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal\nfoetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation, with normal\nfoetal morphology documented by ultrasound or by direct\nexamination of the foetus, or\n(b) One or more premature births of a morphologically normal\nneonate before the 34th week of gestation because of: (i)\neclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia defined according to\nstandard definitions, or (ii) recognised features of placental\ninsufficiency\u00b6, or\n(c) Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous\nabortions before the 10th week of gestation, with maternal\nanatomic or hormonal abnormalities and, paternal and\nmaternal chromosomal causes excluded. In studies of populations of patients who have more than one type of\npregnancy morbidity, investigators are strongly encouraged to stratify\ngroups of subjects according to a, b or c above. Laboratory criteria**\n1. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) present in plasma, on two or more\noccasions at least 12 weeks apart, detected according to the\nguidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and\nHaemostasis (Scientific Subcommittee on LAs/phospholipiddependent antibodies). 2. Anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotypes in serum\nor plasma, present in medium or high titre (i.e.", "chunk_order": 50}

Anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotypes in serum\nor plasma, present in medium or high titre (i.e. >40 GPL or MPL, or\n>the 99th percentile), on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks\napart, measured by a standardised ELISA. 3. Anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum\nor plasma (in titre >the 99th percentile), present on two or more\noccasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardised\nELISA, according to recommended procedures. *Classification of APS should be avoided if less than 12 weeks or more than 5 years\nseparate the positive aPL test and the clinical manifestations. \u2020Coexisting inherited or acquired factors for thrombosis are not reasons for excluding\npatients from APS trials. However, two subgroups of APS patients should be\nrecognised, according to: (a) the presence, and (b) the absence of additional risk\nfactors for thrombosis. Indicative (but not exhaustive) such cases include: age\n(>55 in men and >65 in women), and the presence of any of the established risk\nfactors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elevated LDL or\nlow HDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, family history of premature cardiovascular\ndisease,\nbody-mass\nindex\n\u226530\nkg/m2,\nmicroalbuminuria,\nestimated\nGFR\n<60 mL/min), inherited thrombophilias, oral contraceptives, nephrotic syndrome,\nmalignancy, immobilisation and surgery. Thus, patient who fulfil criteria should be\nstratified according to contributing causes of thrombosis. \u2021A thrombotic episode in the past could be considered as a clinical criterion, provided\nthat thrombosis is proved by appropriate diagnostic means and that no alternative\ndiagnosis or cause of thrombosis is found. \u00a7Superficial venous thrombosis is not included in the clinical criteria. \u00b6Generally accepted features of placental insufficiency include: (i) abnormal or nonreassuring foetal surveillance test(s), e.g. a non-reactive non-stress test, suggestive\nof foetal hypoxemia, (ii) abnormal Doppler flow velocimetry waveform analysis\nsuggestive of foetal hypoxaemia, e.g. absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery,\n(iii) oligohydramnios, e.g. an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less, or (iv) a postnatal\nbirth weight less than the 10th percentile for the gestational age. **Investigators are strongly advised to classify APS patients in studies into one of the\nfollowing categories: I, more than one laboratory criteria present (any combination);\nIIa, LA present along; IIb, aCL antibody present alone; IIc, anti-beta-2-glycoprotein 1\nantibody present alone.
