Investigations\n\u2022 Factor VIII or factor IX assay should be performed in persons\nsuspected of haemophilia with prolonged Activated Partial\nThromboplastin Time and normal Prothrombin Time. \u2022 Mixing test should be done to screen for factor inhibitor in haemophilia. \uf0a1 If it is not corrected, Bethesda or Nijmegen assay should be done\nto determine the factor inhibitor level. \u2022 Mutation analysis for haemophilia should be performed on affected\nmale and his mother. \u2022 Cascade screening for haemophilia should be offered to at least first-\nand second-degree female relatives if the mother of persons with\nhaemophilia is a confirmed carrier. Pharmacological Treatment\n\u2022 Prophylactic factor infusion should be given to ALL persons with\nsevere haemophilia. \u2022 Analgesia should be offered for pain relief according to its severity in\nhaemophilia. Non-pharmacological Treatment\n\u2022 Rehabilitation should be offered in PWH during acute or sub-acute\nbleeds and those with chronic arthropathy. \u2022 Protection, Rest, Ice therapy, Compression, Elevation (PRICE)\nshould be commenced as a first aid measure in acute and sub-acute\nbleed in persons with haemophilia. Inhibitors\n\u2022 Bypassing agents should be used to treat acute bleeding in\nhaemophilia with inhibitors. \u2022 Immune tolerance induction should be considered in all persons with\nhaemophilia with inhibitor.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review\nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of\nSystemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International\nNetwork (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The\nsearch was limited to humans and English. In addition, the reference\nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched further to\nlook for relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to\nidentify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 6 March\n2016 to 15 August 2018. Literature searches were repeated for all\nclinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing\nany relevant papers published before 31 July 2018 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat. References were made to other CPGs on haemophilia e.g. \u2022 Guidelines for the Management of Haemophilia (World Federation\nof Haemophilia, 2012)\n\u2022 Guidelines for the Management of Haemophilia in Australia\n(Australian Haemophilia Centre Directors\u2019 Organisation, 2016)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as references. A total of 17 main clinical questions were developed under three\ndifferent sections (screening, treatment and monitoring). Members of\nthe DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer\nto Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 26 times\nthroughout the development of these guidelines.", "chunk_order": 3}

A total of 17 main clinical questions were developed under three\ndifferent sections (screening, treatment and monitoring). Members of\nthe DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer\nto Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 26 times\nthroughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved\nwere appraised by at least two DG members using Critical Appraisal\nSkill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and further\ndiscussed in their meetings. All statements and recommendations\nformulated subsequently were agreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made\nby consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely on the\nfindings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, with\nlocal practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nManagement of Haemophilia\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. Upon completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG\nCouncil MoH Malaysia for review and approval. Details on the CPG\ndevelopment methodology by MaHTAS can be obtained from Manual\non Development and Implementation of Evidence-based Clinical\nPractice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh. gov.my/penerbitan/mymahtas/CPG_MANUAL_MAHTAS.pdf).

Management of Haemophilia\n1. INTRODUCTION\nHaemophilia is a group of inherited blood disorders in which there is\nlife-long defect in the clotting mechanism. The most common types of\nhaemophilia are haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and haemophilia\nB (factor FIX deficiency). They are inherited as X-linked recessive traits;\ntherefore, males are affected and females are carriers. Females can\nbe affected as well.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CARE\n4.1 Stratification of Haemophilia Centre with regards to\nHaemophilia Services\nHaemophilia is a complex disorder. The wide-ranging needs of PWH and\ntheir care givers are best met through a coordinated, comprehensive\nand multidisciplinary care by a team of healthcare professionals, in\naccordance with accepted protocols and national CPG. Haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) should be established to ensure\nthat PWH have access to the full range of services necessary to manage\ntheir condition. The aim of care is to improve health and quality of life. This includes prevention of bleeding, long-term management of joint\nand muscle damage, and management of complications from treatment\nincluding inhibitor development and possible transfusion-transmitted.

Management of Haemophilia\n6. TREATMENT FOR ACUTE BLEEDING IN SPECIFIC SITES\nAcute bleed should be treated as soon as possible preferably within two\nhours. Amount of factors to be given is dependent on site and severity;\nusually it is given until bleeding resolves. Haemostatic agents e.g. TXA\nshould be given concurrently except in genitourinary bleeding. For\nPWH on prophylaxis with good compliance, prophylactic regime should\nbe reviewed if bleed is not due to trauma.2\n\u2022\nIn PWH, bleeding in head, neck and gastrointestinal tract is a medical\nemergency. Factor replacement should precede investigation. 6.1 Central Nervous System\nAll post-traumatic head injuries and significant headache in PWH must\nbe treated as ICH until proven otherwise.2\n\u2022\nThe initial factor replacement therapy to raise factor levels to 100 IU/\ndL should precede all investigations.2; 39, level III\nICH must be confirmed by urgent imaging e.g. Computed Tomography\n(CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before further administration\nof factors.2\nFollowing ICH, prophylaxis is indicated.2\nRefer to Table 10 on recommended treatment. 6.2 Joints\nHaemarthrosis is defined as bleeding into a joint space which may\noccur spontaneously or in response to trauma especially in moderate\nand severe haemophilia.

It is difficult to differentiate\nfrom flare ups of haemophilia arthropathy. However, for haemarthrosis, the\njoint rapidly loses ROM and becomes acutely painful, warm and swollen. A re-bleed is defined as worsening of the condition while on treatment\nor within 72 hours of stopping treatment. Recurrent haemarthroses are almost invariably associated with\nsevere haemophilia. When it occurs in the same joint \u22653 times within\na consecutive 6-month period, the joint will become a target joint and\neventually lead to haemophilic arthropathy if not treated.2\nManagement of Haemophilia\nA joint ceases to be a target joint when there is <2 bleeds into the joint\nwithin 12 consecutive months.33\nThe goal of treatment of acute haemarthrosis is to stop the bleeding\nas soon as possible.

A pseudotumour is an encapsulated haematoma with a thick, fibrous\ncapsule. Repeated cycles of bleeding and calcification will lead to\nprogressive enlargement of the mass and subsequent erosion of the\nadjacent bone. The rich vascular supply of the capsule is the cause of\nexcessive bleeding during and after surgery, and this vascular supply\nusually originates from more than a single artery. There are two types of pseudotumour:\n\u2022\nproximal pseudotumour\n\u2022\ndistal pseudotumour\nProximal pseudotumour frequently occurs in the proximal axial skeleton,\nespecially around the femur and pelvis. This slow growing tumour\noccurs more frequently in adults and do not respond to conservative\ntreatment.48, level III\nDistal pseudotumour predominantly affects younger age group, develop\nrapidly and appear to be secondary to an intraosseous haemorrhage. The sites of the tumour includes tibia, metacarpal, phallanges,\nparanasal sinus,48, level III mandible and maxilla.49, level III\nManagement of Haemophilia\nPseudotumour generally presents with painless, firm, expanding\nmasses that may appear to be multilocular and adherent to the deeper\nstructures. It may remain asymptomatic until complications occur.48, level III\nThe typical radiological features are large soft-tissue masses and areas\nof adjacent bone destruction. Calcification within the mass is a frequent\nfinding. Pseudotumour of the ilium may cause significant bony erosion\nwith little new periosteal bone formation.48, level III\nUntreated pseudotumour leads to complications e.g.:\n\u2022\nfistulisation to skin or intraabdominal organs\n\u2022\ninfection\n\u2022\npathological fracture\n\u2022\nsepticaemia\n\u2022\ninternal bleeding\n\u2022\ndeath\nTreatment for pseudotumour\na.

However, the high cost limits its use. Based on current local\nprice, the estimated cost of prophylactic aPCC in a 50 kg patient is\nRM4.5 million/year (1 vial of 500 IU=RM2726). Management of Haemophilia\nNovel agents such as SC emicizumab, concizumab and fitusiran are\nbeing investigated as alternative prophylaxis for PWH with inhibitors. Emicizumab, a bispecific monoclonal antibody that bridges factor IXa\nand factor X, and given as a weekly SC injection has been approved\nby FDA and EMA. 8.3 Eradication of Inhibitors\nThe rationale for advocating immune tolerance induction (ITI) in PWH\nwith inhibitor is because treatment with bypassing agents is suboptimal\nas compared with factor replacement therapy in PWH without inhibitor. Hence, eradication of inhibitor is important to put the patient back on\nprophylactic therapy with factor concentrate. ITI is a therapy where repeated medium to large doses of factor\nconcentrate are administered over a period of weeks to years to\ninduce antigen specific tolerance and reduce inhibitory antibodies. It is carried out until the antibodies disappear. There are different\nregimens consisting of various factor dosages with or without immune\nsuppression.", "chunk_order": 32}

Regular and standardised evaluation should be done at least\n12-monthly so that problems are identified early and treatment modified\naccordingly.2 The parameters to monitor are:\n\u2022\ninhibitors\n\u2022\nbleed frequency\n\u2022\njoint health\n\u2022\nradiological measures\n13.1 Inhibitors\nRefer to Chapter 8 on Inhibitors. 13.2 Bleeding Frequency\nBleeding pattern is the key parameter to evaluate the efficacy of\ntreatment strategy and thus, information on bleeding episodes should\nbe thoroughly documented. Issues related to haemostasis (bleed\nrecord) should be evaluated.2\nStandard assessment of bleed frequency includes ABR, which is the\nnumber of bleeds collected over 12 consecutive months. In addition\nto ABR, annual joint bleeding rate (AJBR) should be specified.92, level III\nABR is calculated based on the following formula:93, level I\nABR\n=\nNumber of bleeding events\n(Number of days receiving treatment/365.25 days)\nInformation to be recorded on haemarthrosis and other types of\nbleeding are:92, level III; 94, level III\n\u2022\nnumber of episodes\n\u2022\ntime and site of each bleed\n\u2022\nprovoked (i.e. traumatic) or spontaneous bleed\n\u2022\ntarget joint or non-target joint bleed\n\u2022\ndose, number, interval and response to factor administration\nIn PWH treated with early prophylaxis, self-reported bleeding does\nnot significantly correlate with any other outcome parameters (ABR\nwith HJHS: r=0.107; Functional Independence Score in Haemophilia\n(FISH): r=0.300; Pettersson scores: r=0.016; Arnold-Hilgartner (AH)\nManagement of Haemophilia\nscores: r=0.081; and additive and progressive scores: r=0.073 and\n0.066 respectively).95, level III\nIn addition to self-reported bleeding, outcome assessment in PWH\non long-term prophylaxis should include objective joint assessment,\nassessment of activities and health-related QoL.15, level III\n13.3 Joint Health\nPreservation of good joint status is an important component of\nhaemophilia care. The HJHS is a clinical measure of joint structure and\nfunction. It is more efficient than WFH score at differentiating:96, level III\n\u2022\nsevere from mild and moderate haemophilia (97%, p=0.003)\n\u2022\nsubjects treated with prophylaxis from those treated on-demand\n(74%, p=0.003)\nInter-physiotherapist discrepancies in routine HJHS have been shown\nto hamper comparison of scores between treatment regimens.97, level III\nThus, training of physiotherapist on HJHS assessment is essential. HJHS may be used safely as a first-line tool for monitoring of joint\nhealth as it has significantly strong correlation with radiological scores\n(r=0.67), moderate correlation with physical domains of the quality of life\nquestionaire (SF-36) (r= -0.50), utility (r= -0.41),15, level III and MRI scores\n(r=0.444 with additive score and r=0.440 with progressive score).95, level III\nIt is recommended to do HJHS at least once a year.94, level III Refer to\nAppendix 8 on HJHS Score. 13.4 Radiological Measures\nDiagnostic imaging provides objective information on the joint status\nin PWH.", "chunk_order": 41}

In PWH on prophylaxis, imaging of the six major joints (knees, ankles\nand elbows) should be considered at the age of eight years or before\nif clinically indicated. Usual interval is at 4- to 5-year intervals.94, level III\nWhen using conventional radiography for assessment, WFH\nrecommends the use of Pettersson score.2 The Pettersson scoring\nsystem has excellent reliability when used by radiologists experienced\nin reading musculoskeletal images. It can be used for assessment of\nadvanced osteochondral changes.92, level III Refer to Appendix 9 on\nPettersson Score. MRI and USG can detect early soft-tissue and osteochondral changes\nin a joint before they become apparent on physical examination or plain\nradiographs.92, level III\nManagement of Haemophilia\nA systematic review showed that USG had the ability to detect pathological\nchanges e.g. synovial thickening and osteochondral abnormalities in\nhaemophilic joints. There was association between USG findings and\nfunctional status of the joint. However, its ability to detect a change in\narthropathy with therapy has yet to be determined.98, level III\nThe current practice of prescribing clotting factor or conservative\nmeasures based on pain perception seems inadequate. There are\ndiscrepancies between musculoskeletal USG findings and patient/\nphysician-perceived pain aetiology. Only approximately one-third of\nthe painful musculoskeletal episodes are judged correctly either by the\npatient or physician. Thus, USG should be part of the assessment when\nPWH presents with musculoskeletal pain.99, level III\nIn a systematic review on MRI as a tool for evaluating haemophilic\narthropathy in children, MRI had good diagnostic accuracy for\ndiscriminating the presence of arthropathy. The association between\nearly MRI findings and long-term functional joint outcomes has yet to\nbe determined.100, level II- 2\nRecommendation 19\n\u2022\nMonitoring of care in person with haemophilia should include:\n\uf0a1 Annual Bleeding Rate\n\uf0a1 inhibitor screening*\n\uf0a1 Annual Haemophilia Joint Health Score\n\uf0a1 ultrasound of knee, ankle and elbow when feasible\n*Refer to Chapter 8 on Inhibitor.
