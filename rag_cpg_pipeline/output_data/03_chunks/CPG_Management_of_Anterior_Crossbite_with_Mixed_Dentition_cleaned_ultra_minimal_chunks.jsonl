Clinical audit indicators have also been identified for\nthe purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes. Evidence was retrieved from publications from the year 2002 onwards. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: PUBMED/MEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic\nReviews (CDSR); ISI Web of Knowledge; and full text journal articles via\nOVID search engine. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles\nretrieved were searched to identify further studies.

TARGET USER\nThe guideline is applicable to dental healthcare providers involved in the\n\u2018management of anterior crossbite in children. HEALTHCARE SETTINGS\nAll dental departments and clinics are the common areas of use. ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS AND COST IMPLICATIONS\n\u2018One of the major responsibilities of dental healthcare providers is to\nintercept a developing malocclusion in children. Anterior crossbite is\n\u2018often observed in the mixed dentition and there is a universal\nagreement that the condition should be treated early. Some general\ndental practitioners are unfamiliar with treating anterior crossbite in\nchildren. Delaying such interceptive treatment may worsen the malocclusion, is\ndetrimental to dental health and may cause functional problems. In some\ninstances, it may lead to unfavourable jaw growth. Success in treatment\nis mostly dependent on the timely and appropriate management of the\nanterior crossbite. Hence, it is important to disseminate the knowledge\namong healthcare providers, as well as to lay people, to actively seek\ntreatment as an interceptive measure. This can be facilitated through the\ndevelopment of appropriate training modules, quick references and\nPatient information leaflets. Cost implications on management of anterior crossbite in children may\nvary depending on several factors, such as patient's age and\ncooperation, operator's experience and appliances used. Successful\ntreatment and stability following correction would depend on adequate\noverbite, a good interincisal angle and favourable growth.

INTRODUCTION\nAnterior crossbite occurs when the upper anterior teeth occlude lingual\nto the lower anterior teeth. This may involve one or more anterior teeth\neither in the deciduous or permanent dentition. There is a presence of\nan abnormal relationship of a tooth or teeth to the opposing teeth, in\nwhich normal labiolingual relationship is reversed. Prevalence of anterior crossbite varies significantly from one ethnic\ngroup to another. According to Lin JJ,\u201c \"\ncrossbite was 13.83% in a Taiwanese sample of 7,090 elementary and\njunior high school students, aged 9 to 15 years old. the prevalence of anterior\n2.

EXAMINATION\nA thorough clinical examination and diagnosis of the anterior crossbite\nshould be done to ascertain the aetiology of the crossbite. 6.1 Patient assessment\n\u2018\u00a9 Some of the common concems regarding anterior crossbite\nare:\n\u00a9 irregularity/ crowding of upper front teeth. \u00a9 little/ no exposure of upper front teeth on smiling. of lower incisors. \u00a9 gingival recession. \u00a9 Some patients may be unaware of their crossbite and have\nbeen referred by their general dental practitioner. 6.2 History\n\u2018\u00a9 Relevant medical / dental history should be noted. Family history of a Class II! skeletal pattern. \u00a9 Social history. 6.3 Extra-oral examination\nSkeletal pattern: A-P, Vertical and Transversrelationships\nTM: tenderness, clicking, crepitus, mobility. \u2018Any symptoms should be recorded. \u2018\u00a9 Soft tissue profile: straight, convex, concave. 6.4 Intra-oral examination\nGeneral condition of the oral cavity should be assessed: oral\nhygiene, gingival health and DMF status. \u2018Assessment of the arches: crowding, spacing, inclination of\nincisors. Number of teeth involved in the anterior crossbite, overjet,\noverbite, buccal segment relationship and center line\ndiscrepancy. Signs of attrition and periodontal breakdown due to traumatic\nocclusion if present. Presence of mandibular displacement due to premature\ncontact and the ability to achieve an edge-to-edge incisor\nrelationship. 6.5 Radiographic examination\nOPG: To assess skeletal and dental tissues to detect any\nabnormalities. For dental tissue assessment, it is used to\nconfirm the presence/absence of teeth, condition of teeth and\nthe periodontal status; or\nStandard upper anterior occlusal: To detect any\nsupernumerary teeth in the anterior region and if pathology is\nsuspected in the anterior region. 6.6 Study models\n\u00a9 Study model and wax bite registration in maximum\nintercuspation must be taken for diagnosis and treatment\nplanning.

DESIGNING REMOVABLE APPLIANCE\n9.1 General Principle\nThe success of removable appliance treatment depends on the\ndesign. The design should be simple for patients to use (Refer\n\u2018Appendix 1). Components of Removable Appliances\nActive components. Retentive components. Anchorage. Baseplate. 9.2 Active Components\nThe active components provide force to move teeth. Examples of\nactive components are springs, bows, expansion screw and elastics. The commonly used active components for anterior crossbite\ncorrection are Z- spring and expansion screw. \u00a9 = Z-springs\nA z-spring made of 0.5mm hard stainless stee! wire is sufficient to\ncorrect a simple crossbite involving one tooth. The spring has an arm\nand two activation coils. The coils are of 3.0mm in diameter. The arm\nof the spring is placed on the palatal surface of the tooth. Activation of spring is either by opening of the coils or pulling the\nouter arm of the spring forward and away from acrylic base plate. The recommended force is approximately 30g. The direction of\nactivation is perpendicular to the tangent of the palatal surface of the\ntooth. This may need anterior retention as it may displace the\nappliance downward. \u00a9 Expansion Screws\n\u2018Screws are used to prociine two or more teeth. A screw applied large\nintermittent force to the teeth. It is placed parallel to the intended\ntooth movement. One of the advantages of the screw is a clasp can\nbe placed on the teeth to be moved. It is very useful in cases where\nthere is inadequate number of teeth for retention. \u2018Screw is activated in the base plate by the patient at home according\nto the direction showed by the clinician. The activation is done\n\u2018one-quarter turn once weekly which separates the acrylic by about\n0.25mm. More frequent adjustments, up to twice a week are\npossible but care must be taken not to overdo it as this can cause the\nappliance to be ill-fitting,\n9.3 Retentive Components\n\u2018Adequate retention is important for compliance and efficiency of the\nappliance. If the appliance is loose, the patient may have difficulty\nwearing it. Furthermore, the active components will not work\neffectively in a loose appliance. Common retentive components\nused are the Adams and Southend clasps. \u00a9 Adams Clasp\nThe clasp is commonly constructed on the first permanent molars\nusing 0.7mm stainless steel wire. It can also be made on premolars\nusing 0.6mm hard stainless steel wire.", "chunk_order": 8}

It can also be made on premolars\nusing 0.6mm hard stainless steel wire. The arrowhead is angled at 30\u00b0 - 45\u00b0 to engage the undercuts\npresent at the junction of the mesial and distal surfaces of the buccal\naspects of the tooth. Clasps should be adjusted only when necessary. The clasps can be\nadjusted in two places, i.e. bend in the middle of the flyover and\nadjustment near the arrowhead. \u00a9 Southend Clasp\nThis clasp is preferred where incisors are to be used for retention. It\nis less obstructive and easily adaptable. The wire used for its\nconstruction is 0.7mm stainless steel. Retention is increased by\nbending the arrowhead towards the teeth. 9.4 Anchorage\n\u2018Anchorage is a source of resistance to the reaction from the active\n\u2018components. Anchorage in removable appliance is provided by the\nbaseplate and the retentive components. 9.5 Baseplate\nThe acrylic baseplate serves to hold together the other components\nof the appliance. A posterior bite plane should be incorporated to\nfree the occlusion and allow the tooth in crossbite to move\neffectively. The posterior bite plane should be appropriate in thickness. MANAGEMENT OF REMOVABLE APPLIANCE\n10.1 Fitting Removable Appliance\nBefore fitting the removable appliance in patient's mouth,\nensure that it is the correct appliance for the patient and\nthe design has been followed. \u00a9 Explain to the patient how the appliance works. \u00a9 Ensure there is no roughness on the fitting surface. Try in the appliance and adjust the active and retentive\ncomponents where necessary. Demonstrate to the patient how to insert and remove the\nappliance and get the patient to practice doing it\nGive clear instructions to the patient and parents/guardian,\nstressing on the importance of full time wear (refer\nAppendix 2). Arrange for review appointments. al\n10.2 Review appointments. Ideally patients wearing removable appliance should be\nseen every 4-6 weeks. During the review appointment, the most important thing is\nto assess the patient's compliance. The clues for lack of\ncompliance include:\n\u00a9 Patient's lisp.\"\n\u00a9 Pooling of saliva. \u2018\u00a9 The appliances looks very new and absence of wear\nand tear marks,\"\n\u2018\u00a9 No mark in the mouth. 7\"\nseve mt\n\u2018\u00a9 Frequent breakage. If the compliance is good, check:\n\u00a9 Oral hygiene. \u00a9 Overjet and overbite,\n\u00a9 If the crossbite has improved or corrected. If the crossbite is not corrected, continue to activate the\nactive components. Successful correction of anterior crossbite should be\nachieved within 6-9 months, If there is no improvement\nafter 9 months, patient should be referred to a specialist for\nfurther management. The positive overbite is essential to maintain stable result. No retainer is required if positive overbite is\nachieved.\"*/\"\"\"\nFigure 8a. Prtreatmont photos. Figure 8. Mid-reatment photos.

FIXED APPLIANCE\nMost incisors in crossbite are managed with removable appliances if\npurely tipping movement is required. However, a simple fixed appliance\nsuch as the 2 X 4 appliance is preferred when complex movement is\nneeded.\" \"19\" ''? Fixed appliance is capable of three dimensional\ntooth movement including bodily movement, root torquing, derotation\nand movement of multiple teeth. RECOMMENDATION\nFixed appliance is advocated as the best treatment modality for\nanterior crossbite. (Grade A)\n12. _ INCLINED BITE PLANE\nInclined bite plane used to treat anterior crossbite can be fixed or\nremovable. Composite resin has been used as fixed inclined bite plane\nand is suitable when the anterior crossbite is not more than 1/3 crown\nlength, with no tooth rotation and presence of sufficient space for labial\nmovement. The crossbite should be solely of dental origin.\"\n13. FUNCTIONAL APPLIANCE\nFunctional appliance utilizes the forces of the orofacial musculature to\nmove teeth and modify growth to correct a malocclusion. The aim of\nfunctional appliance treatment in the correction of anterior crossbite is to\nstimulate forward maxillary growth and restrain mandibular growth. However, the major effect of functional appliance is mostly\ndento-alveolar. 7\"? Function Regulator 3 (FR3), Reverse Twin\nBlock *\"*\"\"\" and Reverse Bionator*\u201d*\" \"\" appliances have been used\nin the treatment of anterior crossbite with Class III skeletal base. 14. FACE MASK / PROTRACTION HEADGEAR\nThe preferred treatment for skeletal maxillary retrusion is anterior\nmovement of the maxilla using a protraction headgear.*\"**\"\"' \"it has\nbeen suggested that for maximum skeletal effect, treatment should\ncommence before the age of 8 years (in early mixed dentition\nstage).\u00b0*2%!*' \" tn older children, the changes are more likely to be\ndue to dental rather than skeletal.

However,\nlong-term results are dependent on further growth pattems. The\ndirection of force should be slightly below the occlusal plane. The recommended force is 350-450g per side and the headgear worn at\nleast 12 hours per day. 15.", "chunk_order": 10}

CHIN CUP OR CHIN CAP\nChin cup or chin cap treatment can be used to treat mandibular\nprognathism in early mixed dentition. This treatment produces a\nbackward rotation of mandible giving the appearance that the mandible\nhas been restrained. The positive changes are lost once treatment is\n\u2018stopped and patient passes through puberty.\u00b07\"\"\"\"\nREFERENCES\n1. Lin JJ.
