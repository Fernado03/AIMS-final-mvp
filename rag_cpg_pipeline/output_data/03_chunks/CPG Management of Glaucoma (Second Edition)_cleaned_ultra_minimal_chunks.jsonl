Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Glaucoma (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in a minimum period of four years (2021) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope\nof the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

Recommendation 1\n\u2022 Risk factors* should be identified in the management of glaucoma. Recommendation 2\n\u2022 Population-based screening for glaucoma is not advocated. \u2022 Screening of glaucoma should be considered for patients with risk\nfactors. Recommendation 3\n\u2022 Glaucoma diagnosis should be made based on combination of history\n(with presence of risk factors), ocular examination and investigation. Recommendation 4\n\u2022 Medical treatment in glaucoma should be individualised based on\npatient\u2019s characteristics and drug factors, and adjusted according to\ntarget intraocular pressure (IOP). \u2022 Prostaglandin analogues should be used as first-line treatment in\nglaucoma. \u2022 Patient education should be given to patients with glaucoma. This\nincludes benefits and side effects of treatment, proper instillation\ntechnique of eye drop and compliance to treatment. Recommendation 5\n\u2022 Laser iridotomy should be performed in primary angle closure\ndisease when indicated. \u2022 Peripheral iridoplasty may be considered for initial treatment in acute\nangle closure. Recommendation 6\n\u2022 Intraoperative Mitomycin C during trabeculectomy should be used in\nglaucoma patients at risk of surgical failure. Recommendation 7\n\u2022 Glaucoma patients with blindness or low vision should be referred\nfor vision rehabilitation which includes vocational, occupational and\nindependent living. Management of Glaucoma (Second Edition)\nRecommendation 8\n\u2022 Ocular hypertension (OHT) patients should have comprehensive\ninitial eye examination and assessment of risk factors for conversion\nto primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). \uf0a1 Central corneal thickness measurement should be performed. \u2022 Treatment of OHT should be based on the risk of conversion to\nPOAG. Recommendation 9\n\u2022 Comprehensive eye examination and risk assessment should be\nperformed in primary open angle glaucoma suspect. \uf0a1 Diurnal intraocular pressure fluctuation should be considered in\nthe assessment.

There was active involvement of a\nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. The CPG update was done based on the CPG Management of Primary\nOpen Angle Glaucoma, issued in 2008. In the update, the scope had\nbeen widened to include both primary open angle and angle closure\nglaucoma, and also selected conditions. A literature search was carried\nout using the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid\nand Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Embase,\nPubmed and Guidelines International Network (refer to Appendix 1\nfor Example of Search Strategy). The search was limited to literature\npublished in the last ten years, on humans and in English. In addition, the\nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to\nfurther identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted\nto identify further studies. All searches were conducted from 23 March\n2015 to 29 July 2015. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31 January 2017 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other CPGs on glaucoma such\nas Glaucoma: Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Open Angle\nGlaucoma and Ocular Hypertension (National Collaborating Centre for\nAcute Care, 2009), Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP (American\nAcademy of Ophthalmology, 2015), Terminology and Guidelines for\nGlaucoma 4th Edition (European Glaucoma Society, 2014) and Asia\nPacific Glaucoma Guidelines Third Edition (Asian Pacific Glaucoma\nSociety, 2016). The CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of\nGuidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being\nused as references. A total of 16 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within these\nsections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 25 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and\nManagement of Glaucoma (Second Edition)\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC.", "chunk_order": 3}

This CPG is based largely\non the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials,\nwith local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and\nCPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nGlaucoma is a chronic eye disease that damages the optic nerve,\nand can result in serious vision loss and irreversible blindness. It\nis the second leading cause of blindness worldwide.1 Individuals\nwith glaucoma are often asymptomatic and present at a late stage. Blindness from glaucoma is preventable if treatment is instituted early. The number of persons estimated to be blind as a result of primary\nglaucoma is 4.5 million, accounting for slightly more than 12% of all\nglobal blindness.2 In Malaysia, the 2014 National Eye Survey II showed\nan estimated prevalence of blindness in those aged 50 and above was\nat 1.2% [presenting visual acuity (VA) <3/60 in the better eye] of which\n6.6% was caused by glaucoma.3\nAs with any other chronic diseases, the management of glaucoma\nmay be a burden on the economy. The direct and indirect economic\nimpact of glaucoma on the population has been studied. The direct\ncost estimates for approximately two million citizens of United States of\nAmerica and 300,000 citizens of Australia with glaucoma are USD2.99\nbillion4 and AUD144.2 million5 respectively. However, the true cost is\nprobably higher as about half of the patients with glaucoma are unaware\nthey have the disease.6 - 9\nResource use and direct cost of glaucoma management increase\nwith worsening disease. The average direct cost of treatment ranges\nfrom USD623 per patient/year for glaucoma suspects or patients with\nearly stage disease to USD2511 per patient/year for patients with endstage disease. Medication costs composed the largest proportion of\ntotal direct cost for all stages of disease (24 - 61%).10 A similar trend\nis seen in Europe where resource utilisation and direct medical costs\nof glaucoma management increase with worsening disease severity.

Target IOP is an estimate of mean IOP at which further glaucomatous\ndamage is likely to be prevented.

It is induced by ocular microvascular disease with retinal\nManagement of Glaucoma (Second Edition)\n35\nischaemia. Initially fibrovascular membrane covers the angle,\ncausing secondary open angle glaucoma. This can progress to angle\nclosure glaucoma. The common conditions associated with NVG are\nproliferative diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion and\nother conditions such as ocular ischaemic syndrome and tumours. Management of NVG involves optimising treatment of the underlying\ndisease and control of high IOP. The treatment for NVG includes:15\n\u2022 medical treatment\n\uf0a1 topical and systemic IOP lowering medication (refer to\nSubchapter on Medical Treatment)\n\uf0a1 topical steroid\n\uf0a1 topical atropine\n\u2022 laser/surgery\n\uf0a1 retinal ablation with laser or cryotherapy\n\uf0a1 filtering surgery with antimetabolites\n\uf0a1 GDD\n\uf0a1 cyclodestructive procedure\n\uf0a1 intravitreal or intracameral anti-vascular endothelial growth factor\n(anti-VEGF)\nNVG is a difficult condition to manage and medical treatment usually\nfails to control the IOP.

However, refractive surgery is relatively contraindicated\nin patients with glaucoma because of its potential problems. These\ninclude acute transient IOP elevation and damage to existing filtering\nblebs during corneal flap construction, steroid-induced IOP elevation\nand pressure-induced intra-lamellar stromal keratitis, and inaccuracy of\npost-operative IOP measurement which may influence the management\nof glaucoma. Most IOP measuring devices are reliant on corneal biomechanics\nand thickness. Different corneal thickness and tissue properties have\nvarying effects of IOP measurement by different IOP measuring\ndevices.

A normal patient with a large disc tend to have a large\ncup, thus a larger CDR. \u2022\nOD size can be estimated using a handheld convex lens and a slit\nlamp (using the adjustable beam height). \u2022\nA small beam is adjusted to the vertical diameter of the OD and its\nlength is read on the scale of the slit lamp. It is most accurate in a\ndiated pupil. \u2022\nBased on the lens used, this value needs to be corrected using the\nmagnification factor depending on lens power. \u2022\nA normal dics size is approximately 1.5 mm.
