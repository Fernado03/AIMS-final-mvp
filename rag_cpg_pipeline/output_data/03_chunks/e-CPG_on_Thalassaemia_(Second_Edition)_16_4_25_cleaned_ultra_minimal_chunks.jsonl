The guideline should not override the responsibility of\nthe practitioners to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of\nthe individual. This should be done in consultation with the patients and\ntheir families or guardians, taking into account the management options\navailable locally. Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2024 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2028) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairperson of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed, and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

FORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION\n\u2022 In line with the new development in CPG methodology, the\nCPG Unit of MaHTAS is adapting Grading Recommendations,\nAssessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) in its\nwork process. The quality of body of evidence and related effect\nsize are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG DG. \u2022 Recommendations are formulated based on certainty of\nevidence and the wording used denotes the strength of\nrecommendations. This takes into account:\n\uf0a1 quality and level of the evidence\n\uf0a1 balance of benefits and harms of the options\n\uf0a1 patient\u2019s preference and values\n\uf0a1 resource implications\n\uf0a1 relevancy and applicability to the local target population\n\u2022 The more criteria being fulfilled, the more certain is the evidence\nleading to strong recommendations using the word \u201cshould\u201d\nbeing considered. Otherwise, weak recommendations use the\nword \u201cmay\u201d in proposing an action to be made. \u2022 In the CPG, a yellow box highlights important message(s) in\nthe management while a blue box contains evidence-based\nrecommendation(s) for the particular condition. Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nii\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe following recommendations are highlighted by the CPG\nDevelopment Group as the key recommendations that answer the\nmain questions addressed in the CPG and should be prioritised for\nimplementation. Diagnosis\n\u2022 MCH of \u226427 pg and/or MCV of <80 fL should be used as cut-off levels\nfor a positive thalassaemia screening. \u2022 Hb analysis (capillary electrophoresis and/or high-performance liquid\nchromatography) should be used for presumptive diagnosis of betathalassaemia and other haemoglobinopathies. \u2022 Molecular analysis should be done:\n\uf0a1 for all thalassaemia patients\n\uf0a1 to confirm \u03b1-thalassaemia and borderline Hb A2 thalassaemia,\nHb variants and haemoglobinopathy other than classical\n\u03b2-thalassaemia trait and Hb E\n\uf0a1 for prenatal diagnosis for at-risk couples and genetic counselling\nof prospective parents\nScreening\n\u2022 Screening programmes for thalassaemia should be done with proper\nplanning, implementation and follow-up plan.", "chunk_order": 2}

In\naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines\nwere searched, and experts in the field contacted to identify relevant\nstudies. All searches were conducted from 22 October 2021 to 10\nJanuary 2022. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31 December 2023 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat.

A total of 27 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 26 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the two groups. This CPG was developed\nlargely based on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.

This guideline optimises the multi-discipline\ntreatment and address adequate prevention of the disease. TDT patients require regular, life-long blood transfusion to alleviate\nsymptomatic anaemia, suppress ineffective erythropoiesis, enhance\ngrowth and development which will lead to improved survival rate. On\nthe other hand, NTDT patients might require blood transfusion only when\nthey have symptomatic anaemia, poor quality of life, compromising\ngrowth and development, or if there are features of extramedullary\nhaematopoiesis. TDT and NTDT are fluid categories, based on clinical\nparameters, variations, and advances in the clinical management, as\nwell as other modifiers of disease, which may shift a patient from one\ngroup to another during their lifetime.4\nPatients with transfusional iron overload will require life-long, iron\nchelation therapy to help decrease the iron burden and prevent\nlong-term complications associated with end-organ iron deposition\nincluding hepatic dysfunction and failure, endocrinopathies and cardiac\ndysfunction. Currently, haematopoietic stem cell transplant remains\nthe only option for cure for TDT patients in Malaysia. Promising\nnovel therapies e.g. gene therapy and molecules targeting ineffective\nerythropoiesis are emerging options for thalassaemia patients. The National Thalassaemia Prevention and Control Programme was\napproved by Malaysian Cabinet in 2004. Numerous activities were carried\nout following that namely the establishment of Malaysian Thalassaemia\nRegistry in 2007, formation of National Steering Committee, publication\nof Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Transfusion\nDependent Thalassaemia and establishment of Thalassaemia\nControl and Prevention Programme in 2009. Thalassaemia Screening\nProgramme was introduced with antenatal screening in 2009 which\nmoved on to Form 4 School Screening Programme in 2016 and also\nincludes voluntary and cascade screening. The 2022 Annual Report of Family Health Development Division of\nMoH Malaysia stated that thalassaemia carrier rate was 579.3/10,000\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nschool children screened. The highest number of carriers was detected\nin Kedah (79.27/10,000 school children screened). Kelantan recorded\nthe highest Thalassaemia Hb E carrier (46.10/10,000 school children\nscreened) while Sabah had the highest \u00df-thalassaemia carrier\n(45.23/10,000 school children screened). \u03b1- thalassaemia carrier,\nbased on genotype, was highest in Kedah (33.43/10,000 school\nchildren screened).5, level III\nThe\n2020\nMalaysian\nThalassaemia\nRegistry\nreported\n8,767\nthalassaemia patients in Malaysia, an increase from 4,541 in 2009, of\nwhich 44.1% were TDT.

It will also address fertility and prenatal diagnosis as well as\nscreening and prevention of the disease. This CPG also aims to update\nrecommendations based on new evidence that have emerged in the\nmanagement of the disease to keep the CPG current and up to global\nstandards. Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\n2. DIAGNOSIS\n2.1. Clinical Diagnosis\nThalassaemia phenotypes can be classified into TDT and NTDT based\nessentially on transfusion requirement. Patients who require life-long\nregular transfusion for survival is considered as TDT as compared with\nNTDT (refer to Figure 1). Figure 1: Transfusion requirement in various\nthalassaemia phenotypes\nAdapted: Cappellini M, Farmakis D, Porter J, et al. 2021 Thalassaemia International\nFederation Guidelines for the Management of Transfusion-dependent\nThalassaemia. Cyprus: Thalassaemia International Federation; 2021. E732 p. It should be noted that the classification may change from one\ngroup to another. Thus, careful clinical evaluation using clinical and\nhaematological parameters should be taken into consideration for\nthe designation of TDT and NTDT based on patient\u2019s \u2018current\u2019 clinical\ncourse. This recent classification is used for standardisation of the\nterminology for research and clinical management. Therefore, it\nmoves away from previous terminologies of \u03b2-thalassaemia major and\nintermedia that may give a false impression of disease severity.1; 7, level III\nNon-Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia\nTransfusions\nseldom\nrequired\nOccasional\ntransfusions\nrequired\nIntermittent\ntransfusions\nrequired\nRegular, life-long\ntransfusions\nrequired\nMild HbE/\n\u03b2-thalassaemia\nHbC/\n\u03b2-thalassaemia\nDeletional HbH\nModerate HbE/\n\u03b2-thalassaemia\nNon-deletional HbH\n\u03b2-thalassaemia major\nSevere HbE/\n\u03b2-thalassaemia\nTransfusion Dependent\nThalassaemia\nHbC/\u03b2-thalassaemia\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\n\u2022 Common clinical presentation of thalassaemia is based on types of\nthalassaemia:\na.

Laboratory Diagnosis\nInvestigations of thalassaemia and haemoglobinopathies require step\nwise approach including screening and confirmatory diagnostic tests. A comprehensive evaluation from clinical history, physical examination\nand combination of laboratory results are important for precise\ndiagnosis. Presumptive and confirmatory diagnosis of thalassaemia\nrequires several tests including red blood cell (RBC) indices, Hb typing\nand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis. The laboratory approach\ndepends on mutation spectrum in the region, available resources and\nage of target population. a. Screening tests\nIn the previous local CPG on thalassaemia, a few criteria for\nthalassaemia screening have been addressed as listed below.8\n\u2022 Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) level of <27 pg should be\nused in thalassaemia screening. \u2022 \u03b1+-thalassaemia and haemoglobinopathies e.g. Hb Constant\nSpring and Hb E, may have a normal mean corpuscular volume\n(MCV) and MCH, thus may potentially be missed if MCH level of\n<27 pg is used as cut-off level for a screening test. \u2022 Iron deficiency, characterised by an increase in red cell\ndistribution width (RDW), should be treated before proceeding\nwith haemoglobinopathy work-up. Ideally, at-risk couples should be worked up for thalassaemia regardless\nof their iron status. Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nThe above criteria should be maintained with the following additional\nupdated information. \u2022 MCH of \u226427 pg and/or MCV of <80 fL are currently being used\nas cut-off levels for a positive thalassaemia screening. MCH is\npreferred because it is less susceptible to storage changes.8; 9\nMentzer Index has been used in clinical practice to differentiate between\niron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and \u03b2-thalassaemia trait. However,\nevidence showed contradictory results on its accuracy10 - 12, level III and\nthus the CPG DG does not recommend its use. Refer to Algorithm 2 on Thalassaemia Screening at Health Clinic -\nWalk-In/ Voluntary/Cascade. b. Diagnostic tests\ni. Hb analysis\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone\nelectrophoresis (CZE) are two recommended methods to provide\npresumptive identification and quantification of normal and variant\nHb. Both methods are complementary to each other for Hb variant\nidentification.9\nHb analysis should be performed on pre-transfusion or three months\npost transfusion samples. Two studies evaluated the utility of CZE\nagainst HPLC and found:\n\u2022 Hb A and foetal haemoglobin (Hb F) level measurement correlated\nwell between the two methods with r of 0.99913, level III and 0.994\n14, level III respectively.", "chunk_order": 11}

However,\nthroughout the years, the screening evolved to focus more on younger\ngeneration for better prevention of the disease. Hence, thalassaemia\nscreening in Form 4 students was introduced in 2016 as one of the\nstrategies to reduce birth of thalassaemia babies up to 75% by\n2030.27, level III\nThe Annual Report of Family Health Development Division 2022 on\nthe Form 4 Thalassaemia Screening of 2017 - 2020 showed 924,487\nstudents had been screened. Of these, 25.5% had undergone Hb\nanalysis while 11.3% had DNA analysis done. Throughout the period,\n53,559 students were confirmed as thalassaemia carrier (579.3/10,000)\nand 109 (1.18/10,000) were diagnosed with thalassaemia. The highest\nprevalence of carriers according to types of thalassaemia were\n\u03b1-thalassaemia in Kedah (33.43/10,000), \u03b2-thalassaemia in Sabah\n(45.23/10,000) and Hb E in Kelantan (46.10/10,000).5, level III\nAccording to a local qualitative study on adolescents\u2019 experiences and\nviews of the national school-based thalassaemia screening programme,\nrespondents stated that age 16 - 17 years old was appropriate for\nscreening.

In Malaysia targeted population\nscreening i.e. thalassaemia screening of Form 4 students has started\nin 2016 and its effectiveness is yet to be seen. Refer to Algorithm 1 on\nForm 4 Thalassaemia Screening Programme. A local study on economic burden in the management of TDT patients\nshowed that TDT proved to be a costly disease.

Genetic Counselling on Reproductive Risk\nCulturally-sensitive, non-directive genetic counselling is particularly\nimportant for at-risk couples so that they can make unbiased informed\ndecisions relating to their reproductive choices. They should be\ncounselled about the genetic risk and the options available for reducing\nit which include PND or pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT). Standard diagnostic methods for PND are via DNA analysis of the\nfoetus obtained from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis. Four cohort studies involving centres with high \u03b2-thalassaemia carrier\nfrequency reported successful reduction in affected newborns via\npreventive methods of PND or PGT as mentioned below.42 - 45, level II-2\n\u2022 Formal genetic counselling and psychological support was provided\nto at-risk couples before testing to facilitate informed decisionmaking. \u2022 Increasing number of PND performed over time was observed. \u2022 Following informed parental choices, 96% - 98.4% of foetuses\naffected by \u03b2- thalassaemia major and 100% affected by Hb Bart\u2019s\nunderwent termination of pregnancy (TOP). \u2022 Increasing awareness and prevention strategies resulted in marked\nreduction in affected births. Decisions for prenatal diagnosis and the selective abortion of an\naffected foetus is influenced by many factors besides the information a\ncouple receive which include cultural, religious and social backgrounds\nand, personal beliefs and experiences. In most cases, affected births stem from failure to adequately inform\nparents of the risk of thalassaemia and prevention rather than their\nrejection of foetal testing.

Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\n6. ASSESSMENT OF IRON BURDEN\nThe rate of iron loading depends on volume of blood transfusion and\ngastrointestinal (GI) absorption of the iron. A unit of packed RBC from\n420 ml of donor blood contains approximately 200 mg of iron or 0.47 mg/\nml of whole donor blood. For packed RBC with variable haematocrits,\nthe iron in mg/ml of blood can therefore be estimated from 1.16 x the\nhaematocrit of the transfused blood product. Transfusion regimens\nwhich aim at keeping the pre-transfusion Hb above 90 g/L (95 - 105 g/L)\nor equivalent to 9.0 g/dL have been shown to prevent extramedullary\nhaematopoiesis and reduce GI iron absorption.1\nIron burden can be assessed using serum ferritin, magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) and biopsy to determine iron content in a particular\norgan.

In delayed puberty, there is a complete lack of pubertal development\nby 13 years of age in girls and 14 years in boys. On the other hand,\nhypogonadism is defined as the absence of testicular enlargement (<4\nml) in boys and breast development (thelarche) by the age of 16 years\nin girls. In the third condition, arrested puberty is characterised by a\nlack of pubertal progression over one year or more. The testicular size\nremains 6 - 8 ml and breast size at Tanner stage 3.

Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\n9.2. Splenectomy-Related Infection\nOne of the risk factors for severe infection is splenectomy. A cohort\nstudy of splenectomised patients where the majority were thalassaemia\npatients revealed:176, level II-2\n\u2022 an incidence of serious bacterial infections of 35% and mortality\nrate of 11%\n\u2022 the most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli and\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\u2022 NS difference in mortality rate between patients with Streptococcus\npneumoniae infection (40%) vs infections caused by other\npathogens (24%)\nOverwhelming post-splenectomy infection is a medical emergency\nwhich is defined as fulminant sepsis, meningitis or pneumonia. It can\nprogress rapidly to multiorgan failure and death. According to the local\nthalassaemia registry report in 2020, 25% of infection-related deaths\nwere among splenectomised patients.6\nGuidelines recommend the following.1; 8\n\u2022 Patients should be educated to seek early care when fever\ndevelops. \u2022 Patients with fever >38\u00b0 C and chills, vomiting, abdominal or\nlocalised pain/swelling suggesting abscess need to be admitted\nfor prompt investigations and treatment. \u2022 Blood cultures need to be done and empirical broad-spectrum\nantibiotic regimens need to be started promptly. \u2022 The antibiotics used should have anti-Klebsiella and antiPseudomonal properties e.g. third-generation cephalosporin\n(cefotaxime\nor\nceftriaxone)\ncombined\nwith\ngentamicin,\nciprofloxacin or vancomycin, and tailored according to local\npathogens susceptibility and endemicity.

Covid-19-Related Infection\nEvidence regarding COVID-19 infection in patients with thalassaemia\nis still lacking. A systematic review on \u03b2-thalassaemia with COVID-19\nfound the following:177, level III\n\u2022 patients with chronic conditions, e.g complications of chronic\ntransfusions, heart failure, PAH and DM, were more susceptible to\nthe infection\n\u2022 mortality rate was 26.5% which was higher than general population\nIn a recent small cross-sectional study on \u03b2-thalassaemia patients\nwith COVID-19, the rate of hospitalisation was 37.5%.

COMPLICATIONS OF NON-TRANSFUSION DEPENDENT\nTHALASSAEMIA\nThough most of the complications seen with TDT and NTDT are similar\nwhen attributed to iron overload, NTDT patients also suffer from a\nunique set of complications not commonly seen in TDT patients. One prospective cohort study on NTDT showed that disease-related\ncomplications occurred in 43% of the patients (splenectomy done in\n24.6% of them) with the commonest being PHT, thromboses and leg\nulcers (unique to NTDT). Two main significant clinical risk factors of\ncomplication were female and splenectomy.181, level II-2 Two cross-sectional\nstudies on TI patients demonstrated that common complications were\nthrombosis, PHT, EMH, leg ulcers and cholelithiasis.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension\nPrevalence of PAH in NTDT is high. A cohort study of NTDT patients\nshowed that the most common disease-related complications was PAH\nat 7.6%.181, level II-2 Long-term post- splenectomy complication (>5 years)\nwas PAH (OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.9).184, level III In a cross- sectional\nstudy, TI patients on iron chelation had lower risk of PAH compared with\nthose not on chelation (p=0.032).56, level III\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nFor monitoring and management of PAH, refer to Subchapter 8.1.c(ii)\non Management of pulmonary arterial hypertension. c. Leg ulcers\nLeg ulcers are often painful but benign lesions commonly seen in\nNTDT. The risks of developing this complication are iron overload, skin\nthinning at the extremities (age-related), high venous pressure due to\nright heart failure and venous insufficiency.4\nd. Extramedullary haematopoiesis\nIneffective erythropoiesis in NTDT patients forces expansion of\nhaematopoietic tissue in areas other than liver and spleen, mostly\nin the form of masses commonly termed EMH pseudotumours. The\nprevalence of these pseudotumours is considerably higher in NTDT\nthan TDT patients. Its prevalence is higher in older patients, those\nwith more severe ineffective erythropoiesis, Hb levels \u226410 g/dL and\nlow foetal Hb levels. It can occur anywhere in the body with paraspinal\nlesions being the most common location. Hence, diagnosis is made via\nimaging, usually an MRI. Apart from transfusion and hydroxyurea, monotherapy with lowdose radiation yields excellent results in up to 50% of patients with\nneurological improvement as soon as 3 - 7 days after initiation of\ntreatment. However, there is a high risk of recurrence that is often\namenable to further doses.4\nSummary of recommendations from TIF in the management of NTDT\ncomplications are:4\n\u2022 blood transfusions for prevention (pre-transfusion Hb target >10 g/\ndL)\n\u2022 hydroxyurea to treat complications\n\u2022 referral or co-management with specific subspecialty i.e.", "chunk_order": 55}

PND of thalassaemia is important because termination\nof pregnancy (TOP) may be offered to at-risk couples, as well as to\nfacilitate management of foetal anaemia during the antenatal period. Prenatal testing can be performed by either invasive (diagnostic) or\nnon-invasive (screening) methods. However, analysis of both cell-free\nfoetal DNA (cffDNA) in non-invasive test and DNA analysis of sample\nobtained from invasive CVS, amniocentesis or cordocentesis are\nperformed in private laboratories. i. Non-invasive test\nThe non-invasive test involves extraction of foetal DNA from maternal\nplasma. It is also known as non-invasive chromosomal check (NICC) or\nnon-invasive prenatal test (NIPT). In a meta-analysis of nine studies, cell-free foetal DNA (cffDNA) in\nmaternal plasma had high sensitivity (0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00) and\nspecificity (0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.00) in detecting paternally inherited\nmutation of \u03b2-thalassaemia.196, level III However, there was no mention on\nquality assessment of primary studies. Detection of the paternal allele\nin maternal plasma is possible in couples with different mutations. If\nthe paternal allele is present in maternal plasma, the probability of the\nfoetus having thalassaemia major is 50% and thus the necessity to\nproceed with invasive procedure to confirm the diagnosis. This may\nreduce the need for performing invasive prenatal diagnosis test by 50%. Another study also demonstrated cffDNA had high sensitivity and\nspecificity (ranging from 98.81 to 100% and 94.72 to 99.31%\nrespectively) in the detection of HbBarts.197, level III\nCurrently, this test is widely accepted as a screening test but not for\ndiagnostic purpose. ii. Invasive test\nThere are three invasive tests that can be used to diagnose thalassaemia\nprenatally which are CVS, amniocentesis and cordocentesis. The\nprocedure chosen depends on gestational age, expertise of maternalfoetal medicine specialist as well as availability of molecular analysis test. Refer to Subchapter 2.2(d) on Molecular analysis (DNA Analysis).

A cohort study on young \u03b2-TM patients who received transplants\nwith grafts from HLA- matched related, HLA-mismatched related\n(haploidentical), HLA-matched unrelated or HLA- mismatched unrelated\ndonors showed:215, level II-2\n\u2022 5-year probabilities of OS for patients aged \u22646 years, 7 to 15\nyears and 16 to 25 years were 90%, 84% and 63% respectively\n(p<0.001). The corresponding probabilities for event-free survival\nwere 86%, 80% and 63% (p<0.001).", "chunk_order": 68}

Cord Blood Transplantation\nUmbilical cord blood cells are a potential source of stem cells for\npaediatric stem cell transplantation in thalasseamia. Although usage\nof cord blood cells alone as a source can result in slower engraftment\nand higher rejection risks, transplant outcome is good when performed\nvery early on young recipients with early disease status and good HLA\nmatch.8\nRecommendation 22\n\u2022 In transfusion dependent thalassaemia, haematopoietic stem cell\ntransplantation should be offered at an early age to those with\nmatched sibling donor. Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nIn local setting, a TDT patient with normal/carrier sibling is a candidate\nfor HSCT. Alternatively, if parents keen for transplant when there is no\nmatched donor available, treating clinicians may discuss with transplant\ncentres for possible options. Refer to Figure 2 below.

Nutrition and supplements\nGenerally, patients with thalassaemia do not have specific nutritional\nrequirements. However, thalassaemia children have been shown to\nhave growth stunting and poor bone mineralisation.8\nGrowth stunting in children with thalassaemia can be minimised with\nhigh-calorie diets which increase IGF-1 production. Supplementation of\nimportant micro-nutrients e.g. vitamin E and C helps to reduce oxidative\nstress and increase iron excretion during DFO therapy respectively.

Folic\nacid supplementation is important for those planning for pregnancy.8\nApart from that, Vitamin D, calcium and zinc supplementation have\nalso been shown to improve bone health and overall growth in these\nchildren. a. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation\nVitamin D deficiency is associated with poor bone mineralisation, thus\ncontributing to thalassaemic bone disease; deficiency is defined as\nserum 25-OH vitamin D <20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) and insufficiency as\nserum 25-OH vitamin D of 20 - 30 ng/ml (50 - 75 nmol/L).1\nCalcium homeostasis is intimately related to vitamin D. Low calcium\nintake in thalassaemia patients contributes to disturbances in calcium\nhomeostasis.1\nVitamin D and calcium supplementation significantly improve bone\nmineral content (BMC), BMD and serum 25-OH vitamin D level without\nany AE in thalassaemia children.217, level II-3\nMonitoring serum 25-OH vitamin D levels has been recommended every\nsix months for thalassaemia patients. Vitamin D supplementation should\nbe prescribed if indicated.1 Refer to Appendix 10 for Micronutrients\nSupplementation and Assessment Strategy Recommendations for\nThalassaemia Patients. High calcium diet e.g. milk, cheese and oily fish is recommended for\nthalassaemia patients. However, calcium supplementation is also\nrecommended if the patient needs vitamin D supplementation.1 Refer to\nAppendix 10 for Micronutrients Supplementation and Assessment\nStrategy Recommendations for Thalassaemia Patients. b. Zinc supplementation\nZinc deficiency has been demonstrated in thalassaemia and has shown\nto affect growth and bone health.1\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nIn two Cochrane systematic reviews, zinc supplementation was more\neffective than placebo in thalassaemia patients. \u2022 An RCT showed increase in bone mass at 18 months followup:218, level I\n\uf0a1 whole body BMC increased by 5.7% (95% CI 2.8 to 8.6)\n\uf0a1 whole body aerial BMD increased by 2.9% (95% CI 1.3 to 4.4)\n\u2022 Another RCT showed increase in height velocity at one year\n(MD=3.37 cm/year, 95% CI 2.36 to 4.38).219, level I\nZinc supplements are available in various formulations with different\ncontents of elemental zinc. The recommended dose is 15 mg up to a\nmaximum of 40 mg per day of elemental zinc according to individual\npatient\u2019s need.1\nOn the other hand, patients with thalassaemia should restrict iron rich\nfood intake.1; 8 These are listed in Appendix 11 on Iron Content in\nSelected Food Items. Recommendation 23\n\u2022 All thalassaemia patients should be given good nutritional support\nwhich include high-calorie diets and certain micro-nutrients\nsupplementation* to minimise growth impairment. \u2022 All thalassaemia patients should restrict iron-rich foods intake. *Refer Appendix 10 on Micronutrients Supplementation and\nAssessment\nStrategy\nRecommendations\nfor\nThalassaemia\nPatients. 14.2.

Psychosocial support\nPsychosocial support plays an important role in the management of\nchronic disease e.g. thalassaemia. Refer to Appendix 12 on Malaysian\nThalassaemia Associations/Support Groups. a. Non-adherence to chelation\nGood adherence to iron chelation therapy is crucial in management of\nthalassaemia. Psychosocial factors (e.g. family dynamics and level of education)\nhave\nnegative\nimpacts\non\nadherence\nto\ntreatment\nfor\nthalassaemia.220, level II-2 Unfortunately, two Cochrane systematic reviews\nshowed lack of evidence on psychosocial support intervention79, level I and\nstrategies using computer and mobile technology221, level I in promoting\nmedication adherence in thalassaemia. Management of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nExpert psychological support (e.g. by family/child psychologists or\nsocial workers) has to be provided at all centres specialising in\nthalassaemia care and this should be tailored to the patient\u2019s age.1\nb. Transition to adult care\nAs the thalassaemia children get older, there is a need for transition\nfrom paediatric to adult health care. This transition process requires a lot\nof psychological support from their parents and the medical providers. There is no retrievable evidence directly on transition to adult care of\nthalassaemia patients. Nevertheless, three systematic reviews showed\neffectiveness of transition programme in other chronic diseases as\nbelow:\n\u2022 patients with SCD with transition programme had significantly\nmore successful transfer to adult clinic compared with nonparticipants222, level I\n\u2022 patient education and specific transition clinics (either jointly\nstaffed by paediatric and adult physicians or dedicated young\nadult clinics within adult services) were successful in some chronic\ndiseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus)223, level I\n\u2022 a\nstructured\ntransition\nprogramme\nincorporating\ndetailed\nintervention descriptions about transition planning, transfer\nand integration into adult care often resulted in positive\noutcomes224, level I\nTo avoid the negative consequences of abrupt shifts in responsibility,\nthe transition should occur gradually over time, starting when the\nchildren are young (e.g. preparing treatment) and increasing their\ninvolvement as they mature (e.g. getting medications, making medical\nappointments).1\nRecommendation 24\n\u2022 Psychological support has to be offered to all thalassaemia patients. \u2022 A structured transition care should be arranged for all thalassaemia\npatients. c. Education and employment\nIn a cross-sectional study on thalassaemia in North America, about\n75% of adult patients had completed tertiary education. Furthermore,\n82% percent of school-age children were at expected grade\nlevel.225, level III In another cross-sectional study in the Middle-East,\nabout 60% of adult thalassaemia patients had completed tertiary\neducation.226. level III\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nHigher education level was achieved in:\n\u2022 patients on regular transfusion and those on regular chelation\ntherapy within this group (OR=2.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.10 and\nOR=3.87, 95% CI 1.36 to 11.0 respectively).225, level III\n\u2022 patients with no complications e.g.", "chunk_order": 71}

Marriage\nGetting married and having a family have been reported in thalassaemia\npatients. A study in Lebanon showed that around one-third (30.3%) of\nthe sample population was married compared with 75% of the general\nLebanese population who were married. Out of 72 married patients, 21\nof them did not have children. Among those who had children, average\nnumber of children was 1.47 and average time elapsed to first child was\n0.85 years.

HU promotes the production\nof Hb F by reactivating gamma-genes. Inducing the production of Hb F\nin patients with thalassaemia may alter the transfusion requirement in\nthe patients.

Novel therapy\nBetter understanding of \u03b2-thalassaemia pathophysiology has paved the\nway for development of novel therapies. These can be classified into\nthe following categories based on the underlying pathophysiology that\nthey address:\n\u2022 correction of the \u03b1/\u03b2 globin chain imbalance\n\u2022 targeting ineffective erythropoiesis\n\u2022 targeting iron dysregulation: hepcidin or ferroportin pathways\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\ni. Correction of the \u03b1/\u03b2 globin chain imbalance\nThe pathophysiology in thalassaemia is contributed by imbalance of the\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains leading to premature destruction of RBCs and anaemia. Gene therapy aspires to provide cure for thalassaemia through\nmanipulation of the genome of haematopoetic stem cell (HSC), thus\ncompensating for the inadequate or faulty function of mutated genes. This can be achieved by:\n\u2022 gene addition via a semi-random insertion of a healthy copy of\ntherapeutic gene into the cells using viral vectors\n\u2022 gene editing via a precisely directed mutation that repairs gene insitu or induces a disease-modifying effect (i.e. reactivation of Hb F\nsynthesis) using site-specific nucleases\nThe modified cells then need to be introduced into the thalassaemia\npatients via two methods described below:\n\u2022 Ex-vivo gene therapy\nThis is a HSC transplantation-based procedure. The autologous\n(patient-derived) HSCs are mobilised with granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) plus plerixafor, harvested by apheresis;\nseparated by immunomagnetic separation and then the CD34+ cells are\ngenetically modified ex-vivo. The patient then undergoes myeloablative\nconditioning followed by infusion of the gene-modified cells. \u2022 In-vivo gene therapy\nThis has also been preclinically pursued, aiming to overcome the\nlimitations of ex-vivo gene therapy. However, there are no commercially\navailable therapy via this method at the time of writing these guidelines. Refer to Figure 3 on Concepts of Gene Therapy.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of thalassaemia should be guided by an evidencebased approach, in order to provide quality care to the patients. Several\nfactors may affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 16.1. Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitating factors for application of the recommendations in\nthe CPG include:\n\u2022 wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers\n\u2022 regular thalassaemia updates nationally according to zones\n\u2022 National Thalassaemia Steering Committee that oversees the\ndevelopment and implementation of thalassaemia services in\nMalaysia\n\u2022 established National Thalassaemia Screening Programme\n\u2022 Malaysia Thalassaemia Registry that captures all thalassaemia\npatients in Malaysia\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:\n\u2022 lack of knowledge on thalassaemia and its management among\nhealthcare providers in general\n\u2022 inadequate coverage of thalassaemia training at all levels of\nhealthcare\n\u2022 inadequate coverage of national thalassaemia screening programme\n\u2022 lack of resources for comprehensive management of thalassaemia\nespecially in remote or high thalassaemia burden areas\n\u2022 lack of awareness, knowledge and understanding on thalassaemia\namong patients, carriers and caregivers\n16.2. Potential Resource Implications\nThe recommendations in this CPG require additional resources in terms\nof funds, healthcare infrastructures and human resources/expertise for\ntheir successful implementation as discussed below. The two main\nequally important aspects in thalassaemia management are preventive\nmeasures (including screening) and treatment. Evidence have shown\nthat good screening and prevention programmes effectively reduced\nthe disease burden in the long run. Diagnosis of thalassaemia need to be confirmed with molecular test. This is important especially for genetic counselling and genotypephenotype correlation. In Malaysia, only limited centres offer this test\ne.g. Institute of Medical Research, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Hospital\nSultanah Bahiyah and a few university hospitals. These centralised\nManagement of Thalassaemia (Second Edition)\nlaboratories should be expanded to other zones in Malaysia to improve\nthe diagnostic services. Despite the existence of dedicated thalassaemia screening programme\namong Form 4 students, there is lack of resources in terms of budget\nand manpower to implement the programme effectively.", "chunk_order": 75}

Despite the existence of dedicated thalassaemia screening programme\namong Form 4 students, there is lack of resources in terms of budget\nand manpower to implement the programme effectively. Currently, the\nprogramme is unable to achieve full coverage of Form 4 students in the\ncountry. There is also inability to retain information on the carrier status\ndue to lack of proper centralised database. Thus, issues of newborn\nthalassaemia due to unknown parental thalassaemia carrier status\ncontinues despite the existence of the screening programme. There is unequal availability of safe and high-quality blood products in\ncertain states. For example, phenotyping and leucodepletion cannot\nbe done at certain areas due to lack of resources. Lack of blood is a\nproblem unique to Sabah which has the highest burden of thalassaemia. Improved networking and co-ordination of blood collection centres in\nother states in Malaysia is crucial to maintain sustainability of blood\nsupply in Sabah. Effective iron chelators e.g. DFX is not available to all patients and\ninability to continue its prescription beyond certain periods due to\nbudget constraints is an important problem. Furthermore, monitoring of\niron overload and its complications by MRI T2*, DXA scan and transient\nelastography may not be available in all hospitals. Due to these resource\nlimitations, patients develop complications which require additional\ntreatment and may lead to more costs. Prenatal testing is costly. Although diagnostic procedures can be\nperformed in public hospitals, the molecular tests are done in private\nlaboratories for shorter turn-around-time and the cost is borne by the\nfamily. Important issues that receive lack of attention among thalassaemia\npatients are education and employment. School absenteeism among\nthalassaemia patients is high due to regular hospital visits and\nadmissions. Psychological support is important for patients with this\nchronic disease but this maybe lacking due to limitations of the related\nservice.
