Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2021 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2025) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

Management of E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI)\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these Clinical\nPractice Guidelines (CPG) were from the Ministry of Health (MoH) and\nthe Ministry of Higher Education. There was active involvement from\na multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the\nCPG development. This is the first edition of an evidence-based CPG on the Management\nof E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI). Literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of\nSystemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans and\nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts\nin the field were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches\nwere conducted from 27 August 2020 to 1 September 2020. Literature\nsearches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG\ndevelopment process, allowing any relevant papers published before\n28 February 2021 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider\nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search\nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. There was no relevant evidence-based CPG used as a reference in\ndeveloping the MoH CPG on EVALI. A total of seven clinical questions\nwere developed under three sections (diagnosis, treatment and referral/\nfollow-up). Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin the sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 12 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines.", "chunk_order": 2}

Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin the sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 12 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist when\napplicable, presented in evidence tables and further discussed in\nDG meetings. All statements and recommendations subsequently\nformulated were agreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence\nwas insufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the\nDG and RC. There were only a few published articles on EVALI and all\nwere of low level evidence. This CPG was developed largely based on\nthe findings of reviews and observational studies, with local practices\ntaken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nManagement of E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI)\nGRADE as much as possible (refer to the preceding page).

It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to\nthe Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the Health Technology\nAssessment and Clinical Practice Guidelines Council MoH Malaysia for\nreview and approval.

DIAGNOSIS\n2.1 Clinical Presentation\nEVALI is a disease that may be missed due to lack of awareness among\nhealthcare providers. In a nationwide study based on cases reported to\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention of USA, there were\npatients who initially presented to outpatient setting with EVALI-related\nsymptoms but not admitted. From this cohort, out of those who were\nlater admitted, 46% were fatal while 21% were non-fatal. The risk of\nmortality was higher among patients with co-morbidities i.e. respiratory\ndisease, cardiac disease, mental health condition and obesity.14, level III\nAlthough CDC case definition stated 90 days, evidence showed that\npatients used e-cig up to the onset of illness and seek medical attention\nacutely soon after symptoms appeared.15, level III\nSymptoms commonly presented in EVALI are:11, level III; 16 - 17, level III\n\u2022 respiratory symptoms\n\uf0a1 shortness of breath\n\uf0a1 cough\n\uf0a1 chest pain\n\u2022 gastrointestinal symptoms\n\uf0a1 nausea\n\uf0a1 vomiting\n\uf0a1 diarrhoea\n\uf0a1 abdominal pain\n\u2022 constitutional symptom\n\uf0a1 fever\nSigns of EVALI that commonly observed are:11, level III; 16 - 17, level III\n\u2022 hypoxia\n\u2022 tachycardia\n\u2022 tachypnoea\n2.2 History of e-Cig or Vaping Product Use for Patients with\nSuspected EVALI\nPatients presented with EVALI symptoms should be asked on the use\nof e-cig or vaping products. Healthcare providers should employ non-judgemental, open-ended\nand private questioning sessions with patients.18, level III Confidentiality\nshould be practised according to local guidelines. Management of E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI)\n\u2022 Questions on e-cig or vaping product use in patients with suspected\nEVALI:18 - 20, level III\n\uf0a1 e-cig use\n- time of last use\n- duration\n- method (aerosol, dabbing or dripping)\n- frequency\n- concomitant smoking products use or substances abuse\n\uf0a1 devices and e-liquids\n- product brand name\n- delivery system (open or closed - refer to Appendix 3 on\nTypes of Vaping Products in Malaysia)\n- types of substances use (tetrahydrocannabinol/THC, cannabis,\nnicotine, modified products, additional substances)\n- product source\n2.3 Laboratory Investigation\nEVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion. Thus, laboratory investigations need\nto be done to rule out other probable diagnosis. There were no laboratory abnormalities specific for the diagnosis of\nEVALI.

In the setting of a normal CXR in a high\nclinical suspicion of EVALI, a CT scan should be performed to better\nassess for lung injury. In a cross-sectional study involving 98 patients from Illinois and\nWisconsin, chest imaging findings were positive in all cases of EVALI. These were based on either CXR or CT scan.11, level III\nFindings in CXR of EVALI patients include ground-glass opacities\nand consolidation which are usually bilateral and almost symmetric in\ndistribution.22, level III The abnormalities are lower lobe predominant or\ndiffuse in most cases with sparing of the heart border and subpleural\nregion.

AETIOLOGY/CHEMICAL PROFILING\nE-cig is a device that produces an aerosol by heating a liquid which\ncontains a solvent in one or more flavourings, with or without nicotine\n(also known as e-liquid). It is composed of an atomiser that uses\nelectrical current from a battery to heat a metal coil. This aerosolises\nan e-liquid, which is conducted from a reservoir to the coil by a wick. Aerosol from e-cig may contain different chemical composition subject\nto device type, voltage used and e-liquid content.18, level III\nGenerally, e-liquid constitutes varying ratios of vegetable glycerin (VG),\npropylene glycol (PG), nicotine, and flavouring agents. However, some\nstudies detected more than 60 compounds in e-liquid, this includes\nchemicals which is not stated by the manufacturer.27, level III As e-cig\nmetal components undergo repeated cycles of heating and cooling,\ntraces of toxic metal can leach into the e-liquid and emitted through\ne-cig aerosol.27 - 28, level III\nChemicals in e-liquid (e.g. PG and VG) and flavouring agent are\nconsidered to be \u201cgenerally recognised as safe (GRAS)\u201d by United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for oral consumption but\nnot through inhalation.

Management of E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI)\n7. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of EVALI should be guided by evidence-based\napproach in order to provide quality care to the patients. Several factors\nmay affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 7.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 wide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to healthcare\nproviders\n\u2022 training and updates on EVALI in relevant scientific and professional\nmeeting, seminar, conference etc. \u2022 public awareness campaigns related to harmful effects of e-cigarette\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:\n\u2022 limited awareness and knowledge among healthcare providers on\nEVALI and its management\n\u2022 lack of awareness among patients, families/carers and community\non EVALI\n\u2022 no surveillance system on EVALI locally\n7.2 Potential Resource Implications\nEVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion. Many tests are required to be done\nprior to confirmation of the diagnosis. Accessibility for imaging facilities\nespecially CT scan is limited. Besides, many laboratory tests necessary\nto be performed in the work-up for the diagnosis are not easily available. Chemical profiling is another important factor to be addressed in\nidentifying the probable toxicants in EVALI. However, many issues are\nfaced in doing it which include:\n\u2022 poor cooperation of patients in providing product for testing\n\u2022 insufficient amount of material to be tested\n\u2022 toxicant of concern did not cover flavouring agents\nCurrently, in local toxicology laboratories, not all toxicants can be tested\ndue to lack of standardised testing methods and high cost involved. Surveillance system also need to be developed to capture the data\non EVALI for policy planning and guidance in clinical management. Furthermore, high level of evidence is required to improve the\nmanagement of the disease.
