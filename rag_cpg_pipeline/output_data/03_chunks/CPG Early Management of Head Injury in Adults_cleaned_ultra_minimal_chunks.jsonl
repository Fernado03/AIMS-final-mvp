Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Priority of care in multisystem injuries is beyond the\nscope of this CPG. REVIEW UPDATE\nThese guidelines were issued in 2015 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2019) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary\nReview Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A literature search was carried out using the following electronic\ndatabases: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), Medline via Ovid,\nPubmed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) (refer to\nAppendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy). The search was limited\nto literature published in the last ten years, on humans and in English. In\naddition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were\nsearched to further identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were\nalso contacted to identify further studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom 5 January 2014 to 9 July 2014. Literature searches were repeated\nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process\nallowing any relevant papers published before 31 August 2015 to be\nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after\nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other CPGs on Head Injury such as\nScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) - Early management\nof patients with a head injury (2009) and National Institute for Health\nand Clinical Excellence (NICE) - Head injury: Triage, assessment,\ninvestigation and early management of head injury in infants, children\nand adults (2014). The CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of\nGuidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being\nused as references. A total of 27 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within these\nsections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 25 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by both the\nDG and RC.", "chunk_order": 2}

This CPG is based largely\non the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials,\nwith local practices taken into consideration. iii\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for\nfeedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and\nCPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval. Details on the\nCPG development by MaHTAS can be obtained from Manual on\nDevelopment and Implementation of Evidence-based Clinical Practice\nGuidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh.gov.my/\nindex.php/pages/view/117). iv\nOBJECTIVES\nTo provide evidence-based guidelines to those involved in the early\nmanagement of head injury in primary and secondary/tertiary care\nCLINICAL QUESTIONS\nRefer to Appendix 2\nTARGET POPULATION\nInclusion Criteria\nAdult patients presenting with head injury (18 years old and above)\nExclusion Criteria\nThe guidelines do not cover definitive management of head injury:\n\u2022\nall surgeries pertaining to neurosurgery and post-operative care\n\u2022\nrehabilitation\n\u2022\nmanagement of multisystem injuries\nTARGET GROUP/USERS\nThis document is intended to guide healthcare professionals and\nrelevant stakeholders including:\ni.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the Malaysian National Trauma Database 2009 report, blunt trauma\nmade up 96% of all injuries. Road traffic accident (RTA) accounted\nfor 75% of cases with motorcyclists being most commonly injured. The\nyounger age group of 15 - 34 years old (56.6%) is at highest risk of\nmajor trauma. A high proportion of those with major trauma (85%) had\ninjuries to the head and neck with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) \u22653.1, level III\nInjury was the fifth (7.86%) commonest cause of hospitalisation\nin Malaysian public hospitals in 20142, level III with RTA being the\ncommonest cause of injury-related hospitalisation. Apart from that,\nhead injury constituted the commonest diagnosis leading to intensive\ncare unit (ICU) admission.3, level III\nBased on the World Health Organization Global status report on\nroad safety 2013, the road traffic fatality rate in Malaysia was higher\nthan global rate (25 vs 18 per 100 000 population). Many lives can be\nsaved with good pre-hospital care (PHC) and quick transportation to\nhospital.4, level III\nStrengthening of emergency services and PHC were identified as\ncrucial in improving secondary care as stated in the country health plan\nstrategy 2011 - 2015 report. Subspecialties development will continue\nto be strengthened in regional hospitals including expansion and\nstrengthening of tertiary care related to trauma.5, level III\nA local study on the effectiveness of trauma services provided by\nsecondary and tertiary hospitals showed an 83% mortality reduction in\nsevere injuries among those admitted to hospital with specialist trauma\nservices compared with those without such services. Nevertheless, they\nhad a higher likelihood of disability and impairment upon discharge. It was concluded that improvement in access to trauma services for\nseverely injured patients and standardisation in management of trauma\ncare within hospitals in the country were required.6, level III\nA specialty and subspecialty framework of MoH hospitals 10th Malaysia\nPlan (2010 - 2015) reported that Hospital Kuala Lumpur and 13 states\nhospitals will be provided with neurosurgery subspecialty to manage\ncomplicated head injury.7, level III However, currently there are only\nnine states and one district hospital with an additional three university\nhospitals providing neurosurgical services. In view of the above issues, this first evidence-based local CPG has\nbeen developed with the aim of guiding healthcare providers in the\nearly management of head injury. It intends to reduce clinical practice\nvariation, provide optimum care for head injury patients and eventually\nachieve significant reduction in mortality and morbidity related to the\ncondition. It also helps in optimising limited neurosurgical subspecialty\nservices in the country with a referral system that includes tele-health\nservices. 2.

Patient\u2019s best\neye, motor and verbal response are assessed and categorised into\nmild (GCS 13 to 15), moderate (GCS 9 to12) and severe (GCS 3 to\n8).12 These are reliable tools to monitor and detect deterioration in\npatients with head injury. Alcohol intoxication, sedative medications,\nhypoxia and hypotension can influence the conscious level. Therefore\nany assessment of GCS should be repeated after resuscitation from\ncardiopulmonary insult or recovery from intoxication and sedation in\npatients with head injury. Other assessments that can be used other\nthan GCS are Head (AIS) and Trauma Score - Injury Severity Score. \u2022 GCS score can be influenced by alcohol intoxication, sedative\nmedications, hypoxia and hypotension. \u2022 Training on the use of GCS (technique and application) is essential\nfor accurate assessment of patients with head injury. Total GCS and GCS Motor Scores including those at pre-hospital are\nstronger predictors of 2-weeks mortality than Head AIS Score scales\nafter traumatic brain injury (TBI). In those aged \u226560 years, irrespective\nof motor scale component of GCS, total GCS score and head AIS score\nis an independent risk factor for the mortality.13, level II-2\nAlcohol intoxication (blood alcohol concentration >0.08%) is an\nimportant confounder which may influence pre-hospital assessment of\nGCS in patients with TBI (p<0.001).14, level II-2\nRecommendation 1\n\u2022 Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Glasgow Coma Scale Score (GCS\nscore) should be used in the assessment of all patients with head\ninjury by trained healthcare providers. 5.2 Initial Management\n5.2.1 Airway and ventilation\nThe most important pre-hospital management in head injury is the\nmaintenance of airway, breathing and circulation. Hypoxaemia [oxygen\nsaturation (SpO2) <90%] is the most important factor related to worse\noutcome (more mortality and severe disability with SPO2 less than\n90%) and therefore needs urgent attention.15\nA systematic review of studies on pre-hospital intubation in severe head\ninjury concludes:16, level II-2\n\u2022 The adjusted ORs for in-hospital mortality ranged from 0.24 (95%\nCI 0.11 to 0.49) to 1.42 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.78). \u2022 There were inconclusive results on functional outcome. \u2022 Intubation failure or complication rates (e.g. pneumonia) ranged\nfrom 2.1% to 41.1%.", "chunk_order": 12}

Although there was insufficient evidence to suggest any recommendation,\nbene\ufb01t and harm of pre-hospital intubation in severe TBI depend on\norganisation of PHC services, skills of staff, risk of procedure failure\nand expected transport times.16, level II-2\nAn airway should be established by the most appropriate means\navailable in severe TBI (GCS <9) to maintain an adequate airway or\nwhen hypoxaemia is not corrected by supplemental oxygen.15\nPatients should be maintained with normal breathing rates [End tidal\ncarbon dioxide (ET CO2) 35 - 40 mmHg]. Hyperventilation (ET CO2 <35\nmmHg) should be avoided unless the patients shows sign of cerebral\nherniation.15\nManual in line stabilisation must be performed in suspected cervical\nspine injury and rapid sequence intubation is the preferred choice of\nintubation technique as it is proven to be not associated with increased\nrisk of adverse neurological outcomes.17, level I\nIf tracheal intubation is required, manual in-line stabilisation is provided\nby an assistant during intubation by using the fingers and palms of both\nhands to stabilise the patient's occiput and mastoid processes to gently\ncounteract the forces of airway intervention.

Hypotension and hypoxia however\nmust be avoided, and fluid resuscitation should be sufficient to maintain\ncerebral perfusion.22, level I\nA multicentre Saline Albumin Fluid Resuscitation Trial showed that the\nuse of albumin was associated with higher mortality in patients with\nsevere head injury. Among patients with severe brain injury (GCS 3 -\n8), 41.8% of them died in the albumin group as compared with 22.2%\npatients in the saline group.

This is especially so in presumably mild cases as there is a possibility\nthat the cases may have pre-existing risk factors to intracranial bleeding\nor symptoms masked by intoxication. Patients presenting with MHI with the following findings may eventually\nrequire neurosurgical intervention:24, level III\n\u2022 restlessness\n\u2022 decrease in GCS score within six hours\n\u2022 severe headache\n\u2022 focal temporal blow\n\u2022 vomiting\n\u2022 confusion\nMale gender (OR=3.82, 95% CI 1.60 to 9.13) and alcohol intoxication\n(OR=12.44, 95% CI 2.14 to 72.38) are important risk factors of delayed\nreferral.25, level III A healthcare provider should be aware that a quick\nand accurate decision of referral for patient with presumably mild head\ninjury can be hindered if the patient is male and intoxicated by alcohol. There is a possibility of ICH after minor head trauma in patients taking\nanticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medication. The frequency of a\npositive computed tomography (CT) with regards to anticoagulation is\n27%, antiplatelet 41% and combined therapy 14%.26, level III\nLow platelet count in TBI patients on antiplatelet therapy contributed\nto negative outcome.

In management of\nhead injury, pre-emptive investigation to detect lesions before they\nlead to further neurological deterioration has superseded the earlier\ndeterioration dependent approach.12\ni. Method\nSafe assessment of TBI in ED requires consistent observation and reevaluation as the injury is dynamic.12\n\u2022 During handover of patient care, ECP should communicate with\nhealthcare providers in ED on details of the mechanism and type of\ninjury, and records of neurological progress since arrival in ED. \u2022 Head chart should be used to monitor patient\u2019s progress.

Frequency\nFrequency of observation should relate to risk of clinically important\nfindings in order to detect early deterioration of head injury.

Canadian CT Head Rule (CCTHR) is used to select patients with MHI\n(GCS 13 - 15) for CT head. CCTHR identifies five high risk factors (refer\nto yellow box below) which predict neurological intervention [sensitivity\nof 100% (95% CI 92 to 100%) and specificity of 68.7% (95% CI 62 to\n70)].50, level II-2\nCCTHR also identifies two medium-risk factors (refer to yellow box\nbelow) which predict clinically important brain injury [sensitivity 98.4%\n(95%CI 96 to 99%) and specificity 49.6% (95% CI 48 to 51%)].50, level II-2\nHowever, CCTHR is not applicable in the presence of seizure, penetrating\nskull injury, focal neurological deficit and use of anticoagulant.50, level II-2\nThe New Orleans Criteria (NOC) derived a set of clinical findings\nto identify a group of minor head injury patients who need CT scan.", "chunk_order": 27}

The scan is indicated\nwhen there is anatomical and/or physiological evidence of head injury. In MHI group with GCS of 15, asymptomatic and no neurological\ndeficit, external evidences of head injury especially skull fracture is an\nindication for head CT prior to a definitive management plan. Skull fractures may occur in the cranial vault or skull base. They may\nbe linear or comminuted, and open or closed. Open fractures are\ndiagnosed when any of the following is present:38, level III\n\u2022 obvious evidence of penetrating head injury (involving skull bone\nand structure beneath it)\n\u2022 skull fracture visualised beneath scalp laceration wound\n\u2022 clinical signs suggestive of skull base fracture\nClosed fracture is diagnosed when skull depression is detected by\nscalp palpation with or without overlying scalp swelling or hematoma. Skull fracture is an important finding to predict intracranial lesion\nfollowing MHI which require a head CT. \u2022 If skull fracture is present, the probability of an ICH is 4.9 times\nhigher than those without skull fracture.55, level III\n\u2022 Skull fracture, with or without clinical signs, in MHI is an\nindependent risk marker of neurosurgically relevant intracranial\nlesion (RR=3.9, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.1).56, level II-2\nHead CT is the investigation of choice to identify ICH following head\ninjury.

In a recent meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies, intervention rates were\nhigher in patients with MHI who had CT scan done based on neurological\ndeterioration compared with those who had routine repeat CT regardless\nof neurological changes (2.7% vs 0.6%, p<0.001). The findings suggest\nthat it is unnecessary to repeat a CT scan after MHI when neurological\nstatus remain unchanged or improves.57, level II-2 Neurological deterioration\nis an independent predictor on the need for neurosurgical intervention in\npatients with TBI who are not on antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy\n(OR=3.98, 95% CI 1.7 to 9.1).58, level II-2\nClinical findings\nClinical assessment (both clinical signs\nof skull fracture and scalp wound)\nClinical signs of skull fracture alone\nwith absence of scalp wound\nScalp wound alone\nSensitivity\n51.6%\n36.1%\n15.4%\nSpecificity\n71.4%\n87.5%\n50.0%\nPatients with MHI who are \u226565 years old and on low dose aspirin, with\ninitial negative primary head CT, have secondary ICH accurately identified\nin routine repeat head CT within 12 hours to 24 hours (p<0.00001).

Anticoagulant-associated ICH has a high risk of bleeding expansion,\ndisability or death. Pre-injury use of warfarin is a significant predictor\nof mortality in patients with traumatic ICH. The important aspect of\nmanagement of anticoagulant-associated ICH is urgent reversal of\ncoagulopathy with rapid decrease of the International Normalized\nRatio (INR) to a value of <1.4, preferably to <1.2. Interventions aimed\nat preventing the haematoma expansion are paramount as larger\nhaematomas are associated with poorer functional outcomes.78, level III\nInternational consensus-based guidelines emphasise immediate\ndiscontinuation of anticoagulant and reversal of anticoagulation in ICH\nby administration IV vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin\ncomplex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant factor VIIa as indicated. However there is no specific target INR for adequate reversal in ICH\npatients on warfarin.81, level III\nIn a review of treatments for reversing warfarin anticoagulation\nin patients with acute ICH, PCC was statistically faster than FFP in\ncorrecting INR. Recombinant factor VIIa rapidly reversed the effect of\nwarfarin on INR with a reported 5% thromboembolic risk. Vitamin K has\nslow onset of action. It carries a risk of allergic reaction. Hence it should\nbe given slowly to all patients with warfarin-associated ICH. Despite the\nmultiple treatment options available, the review did not demonstrate an\nimproved patient survival with any particular treatment option.82, level III\nA study was conducted on 13 coagulopathic patients with traumatic\nICH and treated with recombinant factor VIIa.

The risks include the reoccurrence of ICH once warfarin is\nrestarted versus the risk of thromboembolism without warfarin therapy. Careful control of anticoagulation level decreases the risk of ICH.84, level III\nA long-term clinical study indicated that recurrent WAICH is\nuncommon when anticoagulant therapy is resumed. The end point\nof thromboembolic events and WAICH is not statistically significant\nbetween those restarted and not restarted on warfarin (p=0.62). Clinical\ndecision to resume anticoagulant therapy after WAICH should include\npatient\u2019s general medical condition, risk of falls and risk factors for\nsystemic haemorrhage. Patients without these risks may benefit from\nrestarting warfarin therapy. Failure to resume therapy may subject the\npatient to thromboembolic complications.85, level III\nA systematic review concluded that it may be advisable to reinitiate\nanticoagulation earlier with the timing and intensity modified based on\npredictors of thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications.

Patients may also be considered to be\nintoxicated if tests of bodily secretions are positive for alcohol or\ndrugs that affect the level of alertness. c. An altered level of alertness can include any of the following: a GCS\nscore of 14 or less; disorientation to person, place, time, or events;\nan inability to remember three objects at five minutes; a delayed or\ninappropriate response to external stimuli; or other findings. d. A focal neurologic deficit is any focal neurologic finding on motor or\nsensory examination. e. No precise definition of a painful distracting injury is possible. This category includes any condition thought by the clinician to be\nproducing pain sufficient to distract the patient from a second (neck)\ninjury. Such injuries may include, but are not limited to, any longbone fracture; a visceral injury requiring surgical consultation; a large\nlaceration, degloving injury, or crush injury; large burns; or any other\ninjury causing acute functional impairment. Physicians may also\nclassify any injury as distracting if it is thought to have the potential to\nimpair the patient\u2019s ability to appreciate other injuries.
