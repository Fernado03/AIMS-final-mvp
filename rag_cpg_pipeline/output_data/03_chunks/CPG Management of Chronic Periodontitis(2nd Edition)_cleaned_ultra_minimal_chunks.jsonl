INTRODUCTION\nChronic periodontitis has been described as inflammation of the\nPeviodontium with slow to maderate progressive loss of the tooth\nSupporting tissues. It Is caused by an imbalance between the\n\u2018commensal flora and the defence mechanisms of the host. When\n\u2018these microorganisms accumulate in the dental biofilms it resuits in\nInflammation ofthe gingivae (gingivitis) which may lead to destruction of\n\u2018the supporting tssues.**~\"* Chronio periodontitis affects up to 40% of\nthe adult population in developed or developing countries \"\"=\"* buts\npreventable.**~\"2 The disease presentation varies and the prognosis of\n\u2018the dentition wil depend on the health status ofthe patient, as well as. \u2018the stage at which the patient presents.
