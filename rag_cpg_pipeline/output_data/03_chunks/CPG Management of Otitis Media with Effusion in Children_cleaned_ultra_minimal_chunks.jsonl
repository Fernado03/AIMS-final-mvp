INTRODUCTION\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition characterised by\na collection of fluid within the middle ear without signs of acute\ninflammation. It is common in young children, with a bimodal peak at two and five\nyears of age. Eighty percent of children have at least one episode of\nOME by the age of 10 years.1 In Malaysia, the overall prevalence is\n2.9% with an estimated cases of 761,962.2, level III These figures however\nmay not reflect the actual disease burden as confirmatory testing could\nnot be done in some children during the field survey. A study among\npreschoolers found that the prevalence rate of OME was 18.3%.3, level IIII\nThis disease is also a common ear problem among children especially\nthose with craniofacial anomalies including cleft palate and Down\nsyndrome (DS). A local study conducted in 1992 showed that the\nincidence of OME in children with cleft palate was 57.6%.4, level III\nOME is known to be a fluctuating condition with symptoms that vary with\ntime and age. However, the problem may persist in certain percentage\nof children. The main symptom of OME is impaired hearing.1; 5, level III\nThis condition is often underdiagnosed, leading to untreated hearing\nimpairment, which can cause speech and language developmental\ndelay and poor school performance.6\nWhile most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, some children\nwill need intervention in the form of educational and social action or\nthe provision of hearing aids because of the effects of hearing loss.1\nLong-standing and untreated cases of OME may progress to serious\nconditions such as adhesive otitis media, ossicular chain disruption,\nretraction pockets and cholesteatoma. Medical therapy has been widely used to treat the condition although\nevidence-based benefit has yet to be established. Surgical treatment\noptions include myringotomy with or without ventilation tube (VT)\ninsertion, adenoidectomy or both.", "chunk_order": 7}

Surgical treatment\noptions include myringotomy with or without ventilation tube (VT)\ninsertion, adenoidectomy or both. Opinions regarding the risks and\nbenefits of VT insertion vary and the management of OME therefore\nremains controversial.7, level I; 8, level III\nThe need for a local evidence-based CPG is timely due to variation\nin clinical practice, potential negative impact of OME on hearing and\ncognitive function, and to assist healthcare providers in the management\nof this condition.

The hearing impairment is of conductive type. Common associated presentations are otalgia (60%), upper respiratory\ntract infection/URTI (40%), AOM (30%) and tonsillitis (18%).25, level III\nIn children with OME, reasons for referral to hospital are speech\nproblems (43%), hearing loss (41%) and speech delay (11%).26, level II-3\nOME is an important cause of preventable hearing loss (57.1%), as\ncompared to chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and AOM (33.8%\nand 9.1% respectively).27, level III Hearing loss in children with OME may\nimpair language and cognitive development. However, retrieved studies\nshowed conflicting outcomes between OME and speech and language\ndevelopment.

The results are plotted in a frequency vs intensity graph\nknown as an audiogram. Description on the audiogram pattern is\nprovided in Appendix 5. In children referred for suspected OME, an association was found\nbetween PTA hearing thresholds and TM appearance obtained using\npneumatic otoscopy. The mean PTA of patients with OME and bubble\nwas lower than those without bubble (27.3 vs 37.4 dB HL, p=0.001).5, level III\nIn a study measuring PTA and 226 Hz tympanometry on subjects\ndiagnosed with persistent OME, the mean six frequencies of PTA air\nconduction threshold (PTACT) was found to be greater in ears with\nType B tympanogram than those with Type A tympanogram (29.3 dB\nHL vs 11.5 dB HL, p<0.001).63, level III\n5.5 OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS\nOtoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are sounds generated from the cochlea\nwhich can be recorded by a microphone fitted into the ear canal. Hence, this test is commonly used to determine cochlear status. In\nclinical setting, two types of acoustic stimuli are given to evoke the\nOAEs, which are transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs)\nand distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). As OAEs are transmitted from the cochlea to the external ear canal via\nthe middle ear, the condition of middle ear system directly influence\nthe OAEs findings. Therefore, presence of effusion in the middle ear is\nassociated with absent OAEs. Other cause of absence OAE is SNHL. In two studies, high failure rates of OAEs were found in cases of\nabnormal tympanograms. TEOAEs were absent in 93.5% of children\ndiagnosed with OME pre-operatively. Improvement of all TEOAEs\nparameters were found six weeks (p<0.01) and six months (p<0.01)\npost-operatively.44, level II-3 An association between TEOAEs failure and\nabnormal tympanogram was noted in a group of special care neonates\n(p<0.0001).59, level III\nManagement of Otitis Media with Effusion in Children\nRecommendation 3\n\u2022\nOtoscopy should be performed in suspected cases of otitis media\nwith effusion (OME).

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nIn assisting healthcare provider and patient in the management of\nspecific clinical circumstances, it is important not only to develop valid\nCPG by a sound methodology, but also to ensure the implementation\nof the evidence-based recommendations in it. There is often a gap\nbetween the development and implementation into practice of a CPG. Each implementation strategy is effective under different circumstances\nand a multifaceted approach is most likely to achieve change. The\napproach should be tailored to suit local circumstances and address\nlocal barriers. Successful strategies to change practice need to be\nadequately resourced including people with adequate knowledge and\nskills. Team work and co-operation between primary and secondary/\ntertiary care is paramount to achieve this. 13.1\nEXISTING FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\na. Hearing assessment in child developmental assessment in the\nprimary care and the School Health Programme\nb. High Risk Newborn Hearing Screening Programme in hospitals\nwith ORL and audiology services\nc. Universal Newborn Hearing Screening in selected hospitals\nd. Database on OME based on National Hearing Registry\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\ninclude:\na. Poor understanding/limited knowledge of OME\nb. Inadequate training during undergraduate and housemanship\ntraining\nc. Insufficient resources in diagnosing OME\nd. No specific data registry on OME\n13.2\nPOTENTIAL RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS\nTo implement the recommendations in the CPG, the following factors\nare identified to have potential resource implications:\na. Widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare personnel via\nprinted copies\nb.

Test techniques may have to be modified but the rigour must be\nmaintained. \u00f0\n\u2022\nThe child is required to sit on the parent\u2019s lap. \u2022\nDifferent signals, like speech sounds /s/, /sh/ and /m/, sounds\ngenerated by noise stick, high frequency rattle, chime bar, drum,\ncup and spoon are presented randomly at 0.5 to 1 meter distance,\nnext to the child\u2019s ears.", "chunk_order": 44}

It illustrates the type, degree and configuration of hearing loss. The frequency or pitch of the sound is referred to in Hertz (Hz). The\nintensity or loudness of the sound is measured in decibels (dB). The\nresponses are recorded on a chart called an audiogram that shows\nintensity levels for each frequency tested.

A myringotomy is the making of a small opening in the tympanic\nmembrane (eardrum). The operation is performed through the ear\nwithout external incision. What is a ventilation tube (grommet)? A ventilation tube is a small tube (ranging from 1.04 - 1.54 mm in\ndiameter) which is inserted onto the tympanic membrane. Why does a child need this operation? This operation is performed to ventilate (aerate) the middle ear, to drain\nthe middle ear fluid and to prevent the fluid reaccumulation. This should\nimprove the hearing if the hearing loss is due to OME.", "chunk_order": 47}

This operation is performed to ventilate (aerate) the middle ear, to drain\nthe middle ear fluid and to prevent the fluid reaccumulation. This should\nimprove the hearing if the hearing loss is due to OME. How long does the ventilation tube stay in-situ? It depends on the type of ventilation tube. The short term ventilation\ntube usually will come out on its own after 3 to 6 months. What type of anaesthetic will a child require? The operation is usually performed under general anaesthesia. What should be expected after the operation? The child may be drowsy for a few hours post-operatively. What are the risks and consequences after the operation? Most operations are safe; however there is a small chance of side\neffects/complications such as:\n\u2022\nEar pain\nThere will be slight discomfort or mild ear pain which will usually\nsubsides within 1 - 2 days and does not require analgesics. Paracetamol can be given for analgesia. Management of Otitis Media with Effusion in Children\n\u2022\nDischarge from ears\nMinimal blood-stained discharge may be present for a few days. If mucopurulent discharge occurs, medical attention is required. \u2022\nSide effects of anaesthesia\nThe child may feel drowsy, nauseated and vomiting due to the\nanaesthetic medications. \u2022\nFever\nA low grade fever (less than 38\n0C) is normal after surgery. What are the post-operative instructions? \u2022\nDo not insert anything into the ear canal to clean the discharge. Outer ear can be wiped with clean and dry cloth. \u2022\nThe ears should remain dry. Avoid water entering the ears by\nplugging the ear with vaseline-smeared cotton or ear plug while\ntaking bath.
