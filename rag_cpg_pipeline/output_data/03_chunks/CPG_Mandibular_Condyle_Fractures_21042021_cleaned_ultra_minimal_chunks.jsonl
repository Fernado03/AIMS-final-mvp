They are intended as a guide for\nthe best clinical practices in the management of mandibular condyle fractures presently. However, it must be noted that adherence to these guidelines do not necessarily lead to\nthe best clinical outcomes in individual patient care, as every health care provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the clinical\npresentations and management options available locally. REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThese guidelines were issued in June 2019 and will be reviewed in 2024 or earlier if\nimportant new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating, the head of the\nrelated specialty will be informed and a multidisciplinary team will be formed\nsubsequently. A discussion will be made on the need for a revision including the scope\nof the revised CPG. The systematic review methodology used by the Malaysia Health\nTechnology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) will be employed in reviewing the\nguidelines. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of\npublication. However, in the event of errors or omissions, corrections will be published in\nthe web version of this document, which is the definitive version at all times.

The recommendations were formulated taking into consideration the best\navailable evidence and local practices. Several improvements have been introduced\nin this edition. The scope has been expanded to include management of all\nmandibular condyle fractures. In addition, new and updated information have been\nincluded in these guidelines. Besides this, clinical audit indicators have also been\nidentified for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating outcomes. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases: Medline,\nPubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) and Embase while full\ntext journal articles were retrieved from these databases. The search was limited to\nliterature published from 2006 to 2017, humans and in English. The reference lists of\nall relevant articles retrieved were also searched to identify further studies. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off period. The search\nstrategy can be found in Appendix 1. The details of the search strategy can be\nobtained upon request from the Oral Health Technology Section, Oral Health\nProgramme, Ministry of Health Malaysia. There were eight (8) clinical questions which were assigned to members of the\ndevelopment group. The group members met a total of 16 times throughout the\ndevelopment of these guidelines. All retrieved literature were appraised by at least\ntwo members, presented in the form of evidence tables and discussed during group\nmeetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon by\nboth the development group and reviewers. This CPG is based on reference to the\nfindings of systematic review, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and\ncase reports, with local practices taken into consideration. However, when there\nwas a lack of evidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group\nmembers. Although ideally patients\u2019 views and preferences need to be considered in\nthe development of CPGs, in this instance, it was not feasible. Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures\niii\n2019\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian\nPreventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the formulation of\nrecommendation was done using the principles of GRADE. The writing of the CPG\nstrictly follows the requirement of Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE II). The draft was reviewed by a panel of internal and external reviewers. Recommendations were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs,\nand finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry of Health, Malaysia for approval.

Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures\n1\n2019\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe Mandibular Condyle is the supero-posterior process on the ramus of the\nmandible and composed of two parts: a superior part, the articular portion / condylar\nhead, and an inferior part, the condylar neck (Figure 1). Figure 1: Anatomy of Mandibular Condyle\nThe main aetiology for condylar fractures varies according to geographical, socioeconomic and demographic (age and sex) status of the population. Motor vehicle\naccidents (MVA), interpersonal violence, falls and sports injuries were the most\ncommon causes seen in developed and developing countries. The mechanism of\ninjury involved in mandibular condyle fractures were:\n\uf0b7 Indirect trauma, in which forces were transferred from the more resistant skeleton\n(e.g. chin region anteriorly and body of mandible region laterally) to the\nmandibular condyle. 1, level III\n\uf0b7 The position of the jaw (open or closed) in relation to the direction and magnitude\nof the force also played a part in the type of fractures sustained. The mandible and zygoma by nature of their location and anatomy, are the two most\ncommonly fractured facial bones. In Malaysia, studies have shown that fractures of\nthe mandible range from 42.7% - 83.1% of all facial bone fractures. Inherently weak\nareas of the mandible which commonly fracture are the condyle, the angle and the\nparasymphysis. Condylar fractures have been reported to account for 19.3% - 33.2%\nof mandibular fractures. 2-4, level III\nManagement of Mandibular Condyle Fractures\n2\n2019\nIn Malaysia, in children under the age of 15 years, mandibular fractures accounted\nfor 58.3% - 65% of all facial bone fractures, of which 27% were condylar fractures.", "chunk_order": 5}

Management of mandibular condyle fractures consists of surgical and non-surgical\ninterventions. Irrespective of the treatment methods, several complications such as\npain, restricted mandibular movement, muscle spasm, deviation of the mandible,\nmalocclusion, pathological changes in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), malunion,\nfacial asymmetry, and ankylosis have been reported. 8-10, level III Additionally, in\nchildren, fractures of the condylar process may damage the growth centres leading\nto altered growth and deformity of the facial skeleton.11, level III\nIn view of the high prevalence and potential complications of mandibular condyle\nfractures, this CPG aims to provide evidence-based guidance on the management of\nthese fractures. 2.

MANAGEMENT\nTreatment\nmodalities\nfor\nmandibular\ncondyle\nfractures\nare\nconservative\nmanagement, closed reduction (CR) and open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF). Choice of treatment modality for each patient depends on the following factors: 26-27,\nlevel III\n\uf0b7\nfracture (e.g. age, position and location of fracture, and associated injuries)\n\uf0b7\npatient (e.g. age, compliance, systemic medical conditions, cosmetic impact\nand patient\u2019s preference)\n\uf0b7\nsurgeon (e.g. experience and preference)\nOther factors that should be considered in choosing the treatment modality are cost\nand anaesthesia time. 3.1 Conservative\nThe definition of conservative management for mandibular condyle fractures varies. However, in this CPG it refers to management with:\n\uf0b7\nSoft diet\n\uf0b7\nPhysiotherapy (e.g. mouth-opening exercise)\n\uf0b7\nAnalgesics and anti-inflammatory medications\nThis management is indicated for diacapitular or condylar head fractures in\npaediatric patients. 28, level II-2\n3.2 Closed Reduction\nClosed treatment (refer to Appendix 6) is defined as treatment that does not involve\nsurgical exposure of the fracture. This usually consists of a period of intermaxillary\nfixation (IMF) using either stainless steel wires, elastics or a combination of both\nfollowed by physiotherapy. When comparing different types of IMF, Schuchardt\u2019s device (acrylated archbar) or\nscrews alone have no difference in the functional outcome, but the insertion of 4 - 6\nscrews requires much less time and is less harmful to the teeth and the\nperiodontium. 27, level III\nEvidence suggests rigid IMF for 2 weeks followed by 1-2 weeks of elastic IMF 29-30,\nlevel I or 3 weeks of rigid IMF followed by functional treatment. 27, level III For\nintra-capsular condylar fractures, 10 days of IMF followed by a functional orthodontic\nactivator is suggested. 13, 27, level III\nManagement of Mandibular Condyle Fractures\n12\n2019\nRecommendation 3\n\uf0b7 For closed reduction of mandibular condyle fractures, rigid intermaxillary\nfixation (IMF) may be carried out for:\no two weeks followed by 1-2 weeks of elastic IMF or\no three weeks followed by functional treatment\n3.3 Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF)\nORIF involves surgical exposure of the fracture, anatomical reduction, followed by\nosteosynthesis. Surgical approaches for ORIF can be retromandibular / transparotid,\npre-auricular, submandibular, endoscopic assisted intra-oral approach 27, level III or a\ncombination of these approaches (refer to Appendix 7).", "chunk_order": 9}

Mandibular condylar fractures in this group are unique as there is a significant\ncorrelation between age and site of condylar fracture. 13, 42, level II-3\nIntra-capsular fractures were more commonly seen in children aged below 12 years\nold. 42, level II-3 In children, sagittal fractures of the mandibular condyle were commonly\nseen and 4% to 26% of cases were complicated by ankyloses. 40, level I\nCT scan is the gold standard for radiographic investigations in a paediatric patient\npresenting with clinical sign and symptoms suggestive of an underlying condylar\nfractures. 13, level III\nThe management of MCF in the paediatric group consists of conservative, closed\nreduction and ORIF, with closed reduction being the most common practice. 43, level III\ni) Conservative treatment in the paediatric patients especially in diacapitular and\ncondylar head fractures consists of: 28, level III ; 44, level III\n\uf0b7 Liquid or soft diet for several weeks with close observation\n\uf0b7 Functional exercises and/or physiotherapy\nii) Closed reduction consists of:\n\uf0b7 IMF with rigid wires and/or elastics for a period of 7-10 days.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nIt is important to standardise the management of mandibular condyle fractures at all\nhealthcare facilities in Malaysia using an evidence-based CPG in order to manage it\nappropriately. Recognition of signs and symptoms and appropriate responses from\nthe health professionals are important factors in management of mandibular condyle\nfractures. Clinicians are required to keep abreast with knowledge through continuing\nprofessional education as well as understanding of patient expectations. Therefore, it\nis important for these guidelines to be disseminated to healthcare professionals in all\nhealthcare facilities. Cost implications on management of mandibular condyle fractures vary depending\non several factors such as patients\u2019 co-morbidities and expectations and type of\ntreatment advocated. Successful treatment outcomes would require proper clinical\nand radiographic assessment thus involving further cost. 6.1\nFacilitating and Limiting Factors\nWide spread practise of this CPG can be facilitated by:\na) Dissemination of the CPG to healthcare professionals and teaching\ninstitutions via printed and electronic copies\nb) Continuing professional education on the management of mandibular\ncondyle fractures for healthcare professionals\nc) Presence of adequate resources in all healthcare facilities for diagnosing\nand treating of mandibular condyle fractures\nLimiting factors for application of the recommendations of the CPG include:\na) Lack of understanding or limited knowledge on the management of\nmandibular condyle fractures\nb) Variation in skills and treatment practices\nc) Constraints in equipment and facilities\nd) Inadequate funds\nManagement of Mandibular Condyle Fractures\n19\n2019\n6.2\nPotential Resource Implications\nPotential resources implications to implement the CPG are as follows:\na) Widespread distribution of this CPG to all healthcare facilities. b) Re-enforce training of healthcare professionals to ensure knowledge and\ninformation is up to date.", "chunk_order": 14}

For bilateral condylar fractures, the malocclusion\ncommonly present is an anterior open bite. Mandibular hypomobility\nMandibular hypomobility can be defined in general as inter-incisal opening less than\n40 mm to frank ankyloses. 48, level III The affected mandibular movement includes\nmaximum inter-incisal opening (MIO), lateral excursive and protrusive jaw\nmovements are frequently adversely affected by mandibular condyle trauma. Temporomandibular joint complications\n\uf0b7 Pain\nPain is usually moderate and located in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area or\nmuscles of mastication such as temporalis and masseter of the affected site. 49, level III\nThe pain is usually present on mouth opening but occasionally may be present\nduring occlusion. \uf0b7 Temporo-mandibular joint derangement\nTMJ derangement occurs when there is a change in the shape of the disc. This\ncould lead to disc displacement and the major symptoms include joint sound,\nabnormal movement of the condyle head, impingement of condyle head, mandibular\nmovement limitation and joint pain. For TMJ derangement, changes in disc shape\nand the functional disorders of the condyle-disc complex are minimized and\nprevented by the early reduction and rigid fixation of the displaced bone fragments\nadjacent to the joint. Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures\n29\n2019\n\uf0b7 TMJ ankylosis\nAnkylosis is the most common cause of hypomobility. Ankylosis is divided into intracapsular ankylosis and extra-capsular ankylosis. The ankylosis that is associated\nwith the untreated condylar fractures is the intra-capsular type. The subtypes of intracapsular ankylosis according to Sawhney (1986) 50, level III are:\ni) Type 1: minimal bony fusion but extensive fibrous adhesions around the joint\nii) Type II: there is more bony fusion, especially at the outer edge of the joint surface,\nbut no fusion within the more medial area of the joint\niii) Type III: there is a bridge of bone between the mandible and the temporal bone\niv) Type IV: the joint is replaced by a mass of bone\n\uf0b7 Traumatic arthritis of the TMJ\nTraumatic arthritis is an arthritis that occurs secondarily after the deformity of the\njoint. It is caused by direct injury to the articular cartilage or fracture due to trauma. In the intra-capsular fracture of the condyles, articular surface injury occurs during\nthe trauma onset, and subsequently traumatic arthritis occurs due to chronic and\nrepeated joint movement. 51, level III Clinical symptoms that may occur in an early\nphase include joint sound and pain during joint movement. As bony arthritis\nprogresses, joint sound increases and as well as lock sensation, pain, and mouth\nopening limitation. Facial deformity\nDecreased mandibular growth occurs in 20% to 25% of patients with mandibular\ncondyle fracture. 51, level III This growth abnormality has been reported to be attributed\nto direct condylar growth and severe functional disorders caused by adjacent\nmuscular stiffness, injury of soft tissues, and scars.", "chunk_order": 20}

(2012) found, when compared with the retromandibular\napproach, the pre-auricular approach had more postoperative facial nerve\nweakness which they attributed to retraction injury to access lower neck\nfractures. 53, level III\n\uf0b7 Cosmetically, the scar is well hidden within the pre-auricular crease. 53, level III\n2. Retromandibular approach\n\uf0b7 Indications: direct access to the ramus and the condylar neck with minimal\nretraction. \uf0b7 Risk of facial nerve damage via the retromandibular approach is minimal. This\nrisk is increased with prolonged traction at the operative site, surgeon\u2019s\nexperience, post injury edema, and other factors causing difficult wound\naccess such as obesity. 29, level I\n3. Submandibular approach\n\uf0b7 Indications: access to ramus and low subcondylar fractures. \uf0b7 Submandibular approach showed higher incidence of facial nerve palsy and a\nhigher percentage of visible/hyperthropic scars compared to other surgical\napproaches to the mandibular condyle. 27, level III\n\uf0b7 Paralysis or paresis of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve can\nalso occur either from direct injury or from retraction forces\nOverall, scarring in open reduction was described as acceptable in most cases. 27,\nlevel III, 54 -56 level III\n1.

This is worn for 1-3 months, accompanied by functional exercises. \uf0b7 Under parental supervision, children are instructed to have a soft diet and wear a\nremovable semihard occlusal splint for 1-3 months, 24 hour per day until\nrestoration of the occlusion relationship. \uf0b7 Mouth opening exercises begin at the third week after injury and included vertical\nopening, contralateral excursions, and protrusive movements in front of a mirror. \uf0b7 Exercises continued for more than 6 months. In addition, the group suggests the use of guiding elastics if necessary as an adjunct. B) Adult Patient\nIn adults, either open or closed treatment, early rehabilitation is essential to have a\ngood functional outcome. The protocol post treatment is as follows: 56, level III\n\uf0b7 Guidance elastics for 7 days\n\uf0b7 Elastics at night for an additional 7 days\n\uf0b7 Soft diet for 30 days\n\uf0b7 Functional exercise from day 15 onwards\n\uf0b7 Intensification of functional therapy from day 30 to at least 6 months\n\uf0b7 Weekly visit as outpatient in the first 45 days post op\n\uf0b7 Monthly for the following 6 months\nHowever, this recommendation can be tailored to individual clinical needs.
