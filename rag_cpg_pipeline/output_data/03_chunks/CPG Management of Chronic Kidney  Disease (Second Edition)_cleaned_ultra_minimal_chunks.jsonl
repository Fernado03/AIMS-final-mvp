Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2018 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2022) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults (Second Edition)\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these Clinical\nPractice Guidelines (CPG) were from the Ministry of Health (MoH),\nMinistry of Higher Education and private healthcare. There was active\ninvolvement of a multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the\nprocess of the CPG development. The CPG update was done based on the first edition of evidencebased CPG on Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in\nAdults, issued in 2011. In the update, certain methodology was used\ne.g. GRADE principles, and the scope expanded/added on risk factors,\nclassification, treatment, pregnancy and complications (e.g. anaemia\nand CKD-Mineral Bone Disease). Dietary interventions and lifestyle\nmodification were not included. A literature search was carried out\nusing the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and\nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and\nGuidelines International Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of\nSearch Strategy). The search was limited to literature published in the\nlast four years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference\nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further\nidentify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to\nidentify further studies.", "chunk_order": 3}

In addition, the reference\nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to further\nidentify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to\nidentify further studies. All searches were conducted from 13 May 2016\nto 10 October 2016. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31 December 2017 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat. References were made to other CPGs on CKD e.g. \u2022 KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and\nManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease (Kidney Disease: Improving\nGlobal Outcomes CKD Work Group, 2013)\n\u2022 Chronic kidney disease in adults: assessment and management\n(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2014)\n\u2022 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Management in General Practice\n(3rd Edition) (Kidney Health Australia, 2015)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to being used as references. A total of 11 main clinical questions were developed under four\ndifferent sections (screening, treatment, referral and CKD-related\ncomplications). Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 19 times throughout the development of\nManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults (Second Edition)\nthese guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least\ntwo DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist,\npresented in evidence tables and further discussed in DG meetings. All statements and recommendations subsequently formulated were\nagreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient,\nthe recommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic reviews, metaanalyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG strictly\nfollows the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers. It was also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website\nfor feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally\npresented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the\nHTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia for review and approval.", "chunk_order": 4}

INTRODUCTION\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a global public health\nproblem because of the increasing number of patients with CKD, risk of\nprogression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and high morbidity and\nmortality.1 This growing figure will impose enormous socio-economic\nburdens on the healthcare system. CKD is a common but silent and often under-recognised condition. The Malaysian National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 showed a\nprevalence of 9.07% in adults with CKD, and only 4% of respondents\nwere aware of the diagnosis.2 There were 37,183 patients on regular\ndialysis in 2015, with 7,595 new patients entering dialysis.3 The number\nof Malaysians with CKD is projected to significantly increase in the future\nmainly due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and\nthe aging population. CKD is a strong risk factor for mortality and coronary events.4, 5 However,\nit is preventable and treatable. If CKD is detected early and managed\nappropriately, the deterioration in kidney function can be reduced by as\nmuch as 50%.6 Lifestyle changes, initiation of Angiotensin-Converting\nEnzyme Inhibitor (ACEi) or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) are\nproven interventions to delay renal disease progression and also\nreduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In Taiwan, the prevalence of CKD was estimated to be 11.9% while\nawareness was only 3.5%.7 After the introduction of a nationwide CKD\nPreventive Project in 2001, consisting of screening high-risk populations,\npatient education and multidisciplinary team care, the prevalence rate\nwas greatly reduced and the annual growth rate of patients requiring\ndialysis decreased from 6% to 3%.8 This is a successful CKD prevention\nprogramme that can be emulated in Malaysia. Early detection at primary care and timely intervention are important\nstrategies in delaying CKD progression. Shared decision making and\nclose collaboration between different levels of healthcare should\nbe implemented in the management of CKD locally. The aim of this CPG is to provide an evidence-based guidance\nfor healthcare providers to screen for CKD and commence early\ninterventions to ameliorate or even halt the progression of CKD.", "chunk_order": 8}

It can\nalso be used as a reference for the relevant stakeholders when forming\npublic health plans for comprehensive CKD management. Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults (Second Edition)\n2. RISK FACTORS\nEarly detection and intervention on patients at risk of CKD may prevent\nthe development and progression of the disease. Recommendation 1\n\u2022 Patients with diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension should be\nscreened at least yearly for chronic kidney disease (CKD). \u2022 Screening for CKD may be considered for patients with:\n\u25cb age >65 years old\n\u25cb obesity\n\u25cb cardiovascular disease\n\u25cb metabolic syndrome\n\u25cb drugs e.g. nephrotoxic drugs, long-term use of proton-pump\ninhibitors or analgesics\n\u25cb family history of CKD or hereditary kidney disease\n\u25cb gout\n\u25cb multisystem diseases with potential kidney involvement e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus\n\u25cb structural renal tract disease, renal calculi or prostatic hypertrophy\n\u25cb opportunistic (incidental) detection of haematuria or proteinuria\nThe risk factors of CKD are as follows:\nA. Diabetes mellitus\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for CKD. Patients with DM should be screened at least yearly for CKD.9\nB. Hypertension\nHypertension may be a cause or consequence of CKD and may\naccelerate the progression of renal disease leading to ESRD. Patients with hypertension should also be screened at least yearly\nfor CKD.9\nC. Age\nIndividual >65 years are at increased risk of CKD.9\nD. Obesity\nObesity increases the risk of developing low estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) with RR of 1.18 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.28) and\nalbuminuria with RR of 1.51 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.67), independent of\nmetabolic syndrome.10, level II-2\nE. Cardiovascular Disease\nPatients with atherosclerotic vascular disease have 1.4 times\ngreater risk of developing CKD compared with those without the\ndisease in a 2-year follow-up.9\nManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults (Second Edition)\nF. Metabolic Syndrome\nMetabolic syndrome is a risk factor for CKD as shown by a large\nmeta-analysis of 11 cohort studies (OR=1.55, 95% CI 1.34 to\n1.80). The strength of the association increases as the number of\ncomponents of metabolic syndrome increases (p=0.02).11, level II-2\nG.", "chunk_order": 9}

Drugs\nThere is conflicting evidence in the association between chronic\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin and\nparacetamol usage and the development of CKD.9 However, among\nthe most common risk factors for acute decline in GFR for patients\nwith established CKD is NSAIDs, including cyclooxygenase-2\ninhibitors.12\nUse of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) has been shown to\nsignificantly increase the risk of developing CKD (RR/OR range\nof 1.10 to 1.50)13 - 15, level II-2 and progression of CKD (HR between\n1.26 to 1.32).15 - 16, level II-2 The risk correlates with cumulative dose\nof exposure.14 - 16, level II-2 However, this association was not evident\nwith cumulative dose of H2-blocker.16, level II-2\n\u2022 Certain herbal products including those containing aristolochic acid\nare associated with CKD.9\nH.

Other risk factors\nGout17, level II-2 and asymptomatic hyperuricaemia18, level II-2 are\nassociated with CKD. Individuals with incidental detection of proteinuria and/or haematuria\nduring opportunistic medical screening need to be investigated for\nCKD.9\nOther possible risk factors include autoimmune disease,\nnephrolithiasis, structural renal tract disease, prostatic hypertrophy,\nlow birth weight of <2,500 g, smoking, low socioeconomic status,\nanaemia, nocturia and physical inactivity.9\nManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults (Second Edition)\n3. ASSESSMENT\n3.1 Screening\nCKD screening includes urinalysis and renal function. 3.1.1 Proteinuria\nRecommendation 2\n\u2022 Urine dipstick should be used to screen for proteinuria and\nhaematuria. \u2022 In patients with diabetes, albumin: creatinine ratio on an early\nmorning spot urine sample should be performed to screen for\nmicroalbuminuria if urine dipstick for protein is negative. Proteinuria has both diagnostic and prognostic value in CKD. Presence\nof proteinuria should be confirmed by a repeat test within three months. Refer to Algorithm 1 and 2 on Screening and Investigations for CKD\nin Adults with and without Diabetes. Urine protein excretion may be influenced by factors as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Factors affecting urinary protein excretion\nSource: Ministry of Health Malaysia. Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in\nAdults.

The term microalbuminuria\nis discouraged as it can be misleading in suggesting that the albumin\nmay be small or different in some way.12\n24-hour urine collection should be used for protein quantification. However, an early morning urine protein: creatinine ratio (uPCR) can\nbe used as an alternative.12\nThe diagnosis of proteinuria is shown in Table 2.9\nTable 2.

A positive dipstick test for blood on two\nout of three occasions warrant a full microscopic examination. Urine microscopy (preferably phase contrast microscopy) on a fresh\nspecimen can be used to differentiate haematuria of glomerular or nonglomerular origin.

The Cockcroft-Gault equation has been traditionally used for drug\ndosing based on creatinine clearance. In recent practice, CKD-EPI\nequation is used for drug dosing based on eGFR especially for newer\ngeneration drugs. However drug dosing adjustment should be done\naccording to the United States Food and Drug Administrative- or\nEuropean Medicines Agency-approved product labelling. Cystatin C is used for eGFR assessment and it is independent of\nmuscle mass, age, sex, weight, height or dietary protein intake.9\nThe combination of SCr and serum cystatin C is more accurate than\neither marker alone for eGFR.

INTERVENTIONS IN DELAYING THE PROGRESSION OF\nCHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE\nThe aim of CKD treatment is to delay its progression, reduce CV risk\nand manage CKD-related complications. Optimal blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose control and, use of\nrenin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers in proteinuric-CKD are the\nmain strategies to delay CKD progression. Lifestyle modifications\n(smoking cessation, reduction of weight, low salt diet and other dietary\ninterventions) and avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic agents are\nadditional measures that should be instituted. Refer to Algorithm 4 for Treatment for Chronic Kidney Disease in\nAdults. 4.1 Treatment of Hypertension and Proteinuria for Renoprotection\nThe majority of CKD patients (70 - 80%) have hypertension (usually\nsystolic) which is more severe than non-CKD patients.9 Control of\nhypertension and proteinuria are the two most important interventions\nin delaying renal disease progression.

Angiotensin-Converting\nEnzyme\nInhibitor/Angiotensin\nReceptor Blocker\nACEi and ARB confer both renoprotective and cardioprotective effects. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on ACEi\nin both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus\n(T2DM), and ARB in T2DM with kidney disease showed that the risk\nof ESRD was significantly reduced by 40% with ACEi and 22% with\nARB when compared with placebo or no treatment. ACEi and ARB also\nsignificantly reduced progression of micro- to macroalbuminuria and\ninduced regression from micro- to normoalbuminuria (RR of 3.1 and\n1.4 respectively). This benefit was seen regardless of baseline BP.9\nThere was conflicting evidence on the use of ACEi or ARB in nonproteinuric DKD. In a meta-analysis of diabetes patients with\nnormoalbuminuria, ACEi reduced the development of DKD by 42%.

Avoid\nNSAIDs\nincluding\ncyclooxygenase-2\ninhibitors\n[e.g. mefenamic acid, diclofenac acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin,\nketoprofen, salicylic acid (high dose), meloxicam, celecoxib and\netoricoxib]\niii. Avoid long-term PPI use unless with clear indication. iv. Adhere to risk mitigation strategies to avoid contrast-induced AKI. \u2022 Avoid radio-contrast agents in high risk patients if possible. They\nare those with pre-existing renal impairment (SCr \u2265132 \u03bcmol/L\nor an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), DM, volume depletion, CCF,\nnephrotic syndrome, decompensated liver cirrhosis or concurrent\nNSAIDs/diuretic use. \u2022 Consider an alternative imaging study e.g. ultrasound, noncontrasted computerised tomography scan or magnetic resonance\nimaging. \u2022 Use isotonic saline peri-procedure. \u2022 There is insufficient evidence to support the use of N-acetylcysteine\nand sodium bicarbonate. \u2022 Use non-ionic contrast media with low osmolarity (e.g. ioversol\nand iopamidol) or iso-osmolarity (e.g. iodixanol). \u2022 Use the lowest dose of contrast possible and avoid repeated\nstudies within 48 hours. v. Gadolinium should be avoided in patients with impaired renal\nfunction (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) due to increased risk of\nnephrogenic systemic fibrosis. vi.

Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults (Second Edition)\n8. SCREENING FOR COMPLICATIONS\nCKD patients are prone to develop a host of complications, reflecting\nthe loss of exocrine and endocrine function of the kidneys. The two most common complications i.e. anaemia and Chronic Kidney\nDisease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) are discussed here. The evidence on the screening and monitoring of these complications\nare scarce. Thus, the recommendations in this CPG are mainly adapted\nfrom pre-existing international CPGs. Recommendation 13\n\u2022 In chronic kidney disease (CKD), screening for:\n\u25cb anaemia should be done when estimated Glomerular Flitration\nRate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2\n\u25cb CKD-mineral and bone disorder when eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2\n8.1 Anaemia\nAnaemia is defined as a Hb concentration of <13 g/dL in adult males\nand <12 g/dL in adult females.12, 65\nRenal anaemia is a common complication of CKD due to reduced\nerythropoietin production by the kidney and reduced absorption of iron. It usually starts to develop when the eGFR is <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The\nprevalence of anaemia increases markedly with decreasing eGFR.61\nWhen the eGFR is \u226560 ml/min/1.73 m2, the anaemia is more likely to be\nrelated to other causes.66\nIron deficiency and other causes of anaemia e.g.", "chunk_order": 26}

Suggested Hb monitoring in CKD\n*ND=non-dialysis\nTreatment with ESA must be commenced by or in consultation with a\nnephrologist.61\nThe optimal Hb target in CKD is 10.0 - 12.0 g/dL. However, it should be\nindividualised based on symptoms and co-morbidities.66\n8.2 Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder\nCKD-MBD is a common complication of CKD. Changes in the\nmetabolism of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) typically start to occur when eGFR <60 ml/\nmin/1.73 m2.61\nKDIGO recommends to start monitoring serum levels of corrected\ncalcium, phosphate and ALP at CKD stage G3a.68 However it may be\nmore relevant to initiate the monitoring when eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2\nin local setting. Frequency of monitoring of the above parameters depends on stage of\nCKD, its treatment, presence and magnitude of abnormalities, and rate\nof progression of CKD.68, 69\nThe suggested frequency of monitoring for CKD-MBD is outlined in\nTable 7.

Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in\nAdults. MoH: Putrajaya: 2011\nDESCRIPTION\nControlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a\nrisk to fetus in the first trimester, and the possibility\nof fetal harm appears remote. Animal studies do not indicate a risk to the fetus and\nthere are no controlled human studies, or animal\nstudies do show an adverse effect on the fetus but\nwell-controlled studies in pregnant women have\nfailed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus. Studies have shown that the drug exerts animal\nteratogenic or embryocidal effects, but there are\nno controlled studies in women, or no studies are\navailable in either animals or women. Positive evidence of human fetal risk exists, but\nbenefits in certain situations (e.g. life-threatening\nsituations or serious diseases for which safer drugs\ncannot be used or are ineffective) may make use of\nthe drug acceptable despite its risks. Studies in animals or human have demonstrated\nfetal abnormalities or there is evidence of fetal risk\nbased on human experience, or both, and the risk\nclearly outweighs any possible benefit.", "chunk_order": 39}
