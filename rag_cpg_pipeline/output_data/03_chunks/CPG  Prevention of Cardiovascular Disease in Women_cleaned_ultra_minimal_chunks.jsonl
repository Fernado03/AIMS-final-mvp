FOREWORD BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH MALAYSIA\n2\nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector-General of Health Malaysia\nCardiovascular disease, till this day, remains the primary cause\nof mortality globally. Although it affects both genders, a greater\nemphasis appears to be placed on male patients, who appear\nto develop the disease at an earlier age compared to females. However, it is also known the incidence of cardiovascular\ndisease in females rapidly rises to match males after\nmenopause. From the National Cardiovascular Disease\nRegistry in Malaysia (2011-2013), it was demonstrated that\nfemale patients had a higher in-hospital and 30-day mortality\nfor acute coronary syndrome compared to male patients. Such statistics demand a greater focus being placed, not only on the diagnosis and\ntreatment, but critically on the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women in our\ncountry. Malaysia has a rising prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the population. Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia afflict both gender groups. Coupled with\nsmoking and other non-communicable cardiovascular risk factors, it is important to place\nequal emphasis on both gender groups in the effort to prevent cardiovascular disease. The Ministry of Health is committed towards reducing the rates of non-communicable\ndiseases, including those leading to cardiovascular disease, and these Guidelines form\nan important reference point to all stakeholders. The advent of newer diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has also provided the\nopportunity to improve prevention of cardiovascular disease, including in women. Techniques such as multislice computed tomography of the coronary arteries and\ncardiac magnetic resonance imaging provide the clinician greater options for disease\ndetection, yet each has its limitations. Contemporary strategies such as these will\nenhance the capacity of the clinician to improve both primary and secondary prevention\nof cardiovascular disease, augmenting established strategies such as the exercise\nstress test. Research in cardiovascular medicine has accelerated in recent years, and\nwith such a rapidly expanding evidence base, these updated Guidelines are timely.", "chunk_order": 0}

It is 2 \u00bd times more common\nas a cause of death than all cancers combined. \u2022\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to myocardial ischemia\nin women are varied and maybe multiple. Women with angina may have:\n\uf0d8 Atherosclerotic obstructive Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)-\n(coronary lesions > 50% luminal narrowing)\n\uf0d8 Non-obstructive CHD (\u2265 20% and < 50% luminal narrowing). The\nprognosis of these patients is not benign. It is worse if myocardial\nischemia is documented. \uf0d8 Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (< 20% luminal\nnarrowing)\n\u2022\nOther unique gender specific cardiac issues include:\n\uf0d8 Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy\n\uf0d8 Spontaneous coronary artery dissections\n\u2022\nPresenting symptoms for CHD and stroke in women may be both typical\nand sometimes atypical. \u2022\nPrognosis for women following a myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke is\npoorer than in men. \u2022\nOther diseases that are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV)\nrisk in women include:\n\uf0d8 connective tissue diseases (especially rheumatoid arthritis, systemic\nlupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic vasculitis) and the drugs\nthat are used to treat these diseases\n\uf0d8 chemotherapy and radiation induced cardio toxicity\n\uf0d8 infections such as influenza, periodontal disease and human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n\uf0d8 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n\u2022\nIncreased awareness, early detection with appropriate investigations and\nmanagement is important. \u2022\nAll women above the age of 40 years should know their CVD risk. \u2022\nAssessment of CVD risk involves:\n\uf0d8 History: Looking for symptoms suggestive of CHD or CHD\nEquivalents, family history of premature CHD, smoking status,\nphysical activity\n\uf0d8 Physical Examination: Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist\ncircumference, pulses, blood pressure (BP)\n\uf0d8 Investigations: Blood glucose, lipid profile\n\u2022\nRisk Classification helps to identify High Risk women and to guide\nintensity of risk reduction efforts and the need for pharmacotherapy. Women may be classified according to their CVD risk (Table 1, pg 8) as:\n\uf0d8 High Risk\n\uf0d8 At Risk\n\uf0d8 Optimal Risk\n\u2022\nRisk classification can also be done using the The Framingham Risk\nScore (FRS) in Table 2 (pg 9 & 10). The AHA/ACC pooled Risk\nEquations may also be used although in 2 retrospective studies, the\nFRS was a better estimate of CV risk in our local population. The 2013\nACC/AHA Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk\ncalculator (Table 3, pg 11) is also available at www.cvriskcalculator.com. \u2022\nPrevention of CVD involves a healthy lifestyle and risk factor reduction \u2013\nthe targets of risk factor reduction will depend on the individual\u2019s CVD\nrisk.", "chunk_order": 2}

Unfortunately many women and most healthcare professionals have the\nmisconception that CVD is not a woman\u2019s disease and that it is a disease that\nonly affects men. This Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the Prevention of Cardiovascular\nDisease in Women is the second edition. The first edition was published in\n2008. This CPG has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the\nNational Heart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health and the Academy\nof Medicine.

A review of current medical literature on Cardiovascular Disease in Women\nand Women\u2019s Heart Health from 2008 (the date of the last CPG) till 30th\nAugust 2015 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the\nfollowing electronic databases \u2013 PubMed and Cochrane Database of\nSystemic Reviews. The following MeSH terms or free text terms were used either singly or in\ncombination:\n\u201cCardiovascular disease in women\u201d, \u201cHeart disease in women\u201d, \u201cMyocardial\ninfarction in women\u201d, \u201cCoronary heart disease in women\u201d, \u201cStroke in women\u201d,\n\u201cHypertension in women\u201d, \u201cDyslipidaemia in women\u201d, \u201cCombined oral\ncontraceptives\u201d, \u201cHormone replacement therapy\u201d. The search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and\npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully\nselected from this huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant\narticles retrieved were searched to identify further studies. Experts in the field\nwere also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines -\nthe American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC)\nand European Society of Cardiology - were also studied. All literature\nretrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all statements\nand recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The\ngrading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was\nadapted from the AHA/ACC and the European Society of Cardiology (pg. 18). After much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the\nTechnical Advisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, Ministry of\nHealth Malaysia and key health personnel in the major hospitals of the\nMinistry of Health and the private sector for review and feedback.

Period of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast\nwith recent developments and knowledge that is being learnt regarding\nwomen\u2019s health. Implementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical\ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n\u2022 Increasing public awareness of cardiovascular disease in general and\neducating them on the importance of knowing their individual\ncardiovascular risk\n\u2022 Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on\nmethods of cardiovascular risk assessment and the implementation of\nappropriate preventative strategies depending on each individual\u2019s risk\nstatus\n\u2022 Clinical audit by individual hospitals, units and general practices to\nensure compliance.

In 2 surveys carried out 2 years apart among middle-aged urban Malaysian\nfemale office workers and other professionals, more than two thirds of women\nsurveyed said that cancer was the main cause of death among women.16 A\ncontemporary study done in Spain and the United States (US) found that only\n35% and 55% of women respectively below the age of 55 years perceived\nthemselves at risk of heart disease before their index MI.17\nThis lack of awareness has contributed to:\n\u2022 failure in providing adequate information and health promotion to the\npublic regarding CVD in women.", "chunk_order": 12}

Due to their atypical presentations, women are\noften not appropriately triaged in the emergency room resulting in a delay in\nthe diagnosis and treatment.18,20 This has adverse consequences on their\nprognosis. This CPG highlights the important gender differences in CVD. There are\ndifferences in the clinical presentation, predisposing risk factors and the\npresence of co-morbidity in women. The accuracy of diagnostic tests and\nphysiologic responses to exercise differ. Cultural norms, socioeconomic and\npsychological factors all affect the way women respond to their illness. All\nthese factors have an impact on the management of CVD in women. This CPG provides evidence based recommendations focusing on preventing\nCVD in women. Cardiovascular disease often strikes without warning,\nunderscoring the importance of prevention. The impact of the different risk\nfactors on CVD in women, the role of lifestyle changes and the use of\nappropriate drug therapies in the prevention of CVD are discussed. Decision\nmaking however, should be individualized and based on sound clinical\njudgment. 2. TYPES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE\nMen and women have similar lifetime risks of CVD at age 55 years. There are\nhowever, considerable differences in the first manifestation.21 Men are more\nlikely to develop CHD as a first event, while women are more likely to have a\nstroke or heart failure (HF) as their first event, although these manifestations\ntend to appear when they are older.21\n2.1.

Coronary Heart Disease\n2.1.1. Presenting Symptoms\nIn general, women present with CHD 10 to 20 years later than men.22-26 Before\nmenopause, the prevalence of CHD is low.25\nThere are gender differences in the symptoms at presentation.18,20,22 Angina\npectoris is an earlier and more common presentation in women as compared\nto men who more often present with MI.27 Women often have atypical\npresentations.27 In addition to chest pain or discomfort, women also have a lot\nof non chest related pain symptoms. Compared to men, women\u2019s symptoms\nare more often precipitated by mental or emotional stress and less frequently\nby exertion.27\nThe prodromal symptoms of an MI may also be atypical e.g. shortness of\nbreath, sleep disturbances, diaphoresis, epigastric pain and fatigue.28,29\nHowever, when presenting as an ACS, there are no gender differences where\nwomen may also have typical symptoms (acute chest pain associated with\nsweating).18,19\nWomen presenting with an MI tend to have more atherosclerotic plaque\nerosions than plaque rupture.30 In autopsy studies, plaque erosions accounted\nfor about 25% of MI.30 Most of these erosive lesions have a thick fibrous cap\nand do not have a necrotic core. In a series of patients who presented with MI\nand underwent aspiration thromboectomy followed by optical coherence\nstudies, the residual lesion showed relatively minor luminal narrowing.31 Most\nof these patients were younger individuals including premenopausal women\nand smokers.31\nFollowing an MI, women have worse outcomes irrespective of age.,11,32,33\nMore women had sudden cardiac death (SCD) before their arrival in hospital\nand almost two thirds of women who died suddenly had no previous\nsymptoms.26,34\nParadoxically, women tend to have lower prevalence of obstructive coronary\ndisease but more symptoms, ischemia and adverse outcomes.26,35,36 It has\nbeen postulated that this could be due to abnormal coronary vasomotor\nreactivity, microvascular dysfunction, distal coronary erosion/embolization\nand non obstructive coronary disease.26,37 In view of the varied\npathophysiology of heart disease in women, a more appropriate term would\nbe Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) rather than CHD. Studies seem to suggest that the adverse outcomes seen in women could be\ndue to their baseline risk and clinical characteristics rather than to gender\ndependent factors or to bias in therapies.38\n2.1.2. Risk Factors\nThe lifetime risk for CHD is generally lower in females and depends on their\nrisk profile.", "chunk_order": 14}

Risk Factors\nThe lifetime risk for CHD is generally lower in females and depends on their\nrisk profile. At age of 55 years, with an optimal risk factor profile, lifetime risk\nfor CHD is 3.6% for men and < 1% in women; with \u2265 2 risk factors, it is 37.5%\nin men and 18.3% for women.39 In one study, women were found to\nexperience the combined end point of CV death, MI, stroke and HF\nhospitalization, an average of 5.7 years later than men of similar risk profiles. For MI there was a delay of 10.7 years.23\nThere are important gender-related differences in the prevalence and\noutcome of cardiac risk factors (section 4, pg 52). Generally, women with CHD\nare more likely to be obese and have type 2 diabetes when compared to\nmen.17,18,26 Elderly hypertensive women and young female smokers are\nespecially at risk for CHD. Risk assessment can be used to raise awareness of CVD, educate patients\nabout their CV risk, prompt lifestyle changes, guide therapy, and predict both\n10-year and lifetime risk of CVD.40 (section 5, pg 72)\n2.1.3. Diagnosis and Investigations\nWomen with chest pain are less likely to be referred for appropriate\ninvestigations due to the following:\n\u2022 patient factors\n- differences in presenting symptoms27-29\n- cultural norms \u2013 passive nature, fearfulness, anxiety, denial,\nself-sacrifice and care giver roles\n- co-morbidity e.g. arthritis, obesity\n- age\n\u2022 physician factors\n- lack of awareness and misconceptions\nInvestigations for diagnosing CHD include non-invasive and invasive tests. There are important gender differences in the sensitivity and specificity of the\nvarious non-invasive tests. 2.1.3.1. Functional tests for ischemia\nConventional exercise stress testing has a lower diagnostic accuracy in\nwomen for obstructive CHD. The sensitivity is 31-71% and specificity is about\n66 to 78% in women and about 80% for both in men.18,41,42 This is partly due\nto:\n\u2022\nlower CHD prevalence in pre-menopausal women and thus a lower\npre-test probability of disease\n\u2022 poor exercise tolerance resulting in failure to achieve an adequate level\nof stress\n\u2022 presence of baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities making\ninterpretation difficult\nDespite these limitations, a normal stress ECG at adequate workloads in\nwomen with intermediate probability of CHD is a good indication that there is\nno significant obstructive lesion.41,41 An exercise stress test, however, does not\ndetect myocardial ischemia in women with non- obstructive coronary lesions.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a newer imaging tool to investigate\nCHD in women. It has superior spatial resolution and does not use ionizing\nradiation unlike SPECT.44 The prognostic implications of stress CMR using\neither adenosine or dobutamine is being investigated in women. A negative\nstress CMR study is associated with very low risk of CV death and MI.45\n2.1.3.2. Other Imaging Modalities\nComputed tomographic (CT) Coronary Calcium scoring and CT coronary\nangiography are increasingly being utilized in the diagnosis of CHD in women. Calcium scoring has been shown to improve CV risk prediction.46-49\nThe presence of coronary calcium redefined a group of women improperly\nlabelled as low risk by Framingham criteria.46,47\nA calcium score of \u2265300 was associated with a 6.7% and 8.6% absolute risk\nof CHD and CVD respectively over a 3.75 year period as compared to women\nwith undetectable calcium.46 However, a more recent analysis showed that the\npresence\nof\nany\ncalcium\ntogether\nwith\ntraditional\nrisk\nfactors\n(MESA-Score) provided a better estimate of 10 year CHD risk50\n(for MESA-Score see www.mesa-nhlbi.org/MESACHDRisk/MesaRiskScore/\nRiskScore.aspx). In symptomatic patients with low or intermediate pre-test probability and low\nor zero calcium score, CT angiography accurately rules out obstructive CHD. Care should be taken to adhere to radiation safety guidelines. However, in patients with known CHD and/or extensive coronary calcification\nand/or high pre-test probability of CHD, an invasive coronary angiogram is\nsuperior for diagnostic accuracy.47\n2.1.3.3. Conventional/Invasive Coronary Angiography\nWomen are less likely to be offered invasive coronary angiography in view of\ntheir\natypical\nsymptoms. When\nperformed\nappropriately,\ncoronary\nangiography is associated with a similar low complication rate in both gender. Its underutilization in women results in under-diagnosis, suboptimal treatment\nand poorer long term outcome. In women, atheromatous plaques tend to be distributed diffusely, rather than\nin clumps. As such, coronary angiographic studies in women tend to be\nmisinterpreted as \u201cnormal\u201d.26 Autopsy studies in young people who were\ncertified as having ischemic heart disease as a cause of death, showed that\nfewer women had obstructive CHD despite pathological evidence of an MI\n(obstructive CHD in this study, was defined as \u2265 75% cross-sectional area\nstenosis in an epicardial vessel or \u2265 50% left main).35\nIn a substudy of the WISE registry, intravascular coronary ultrasound showed\nthat almost 80% of women who had \u201cnormal\u201d coronary arteries by\nconventional coronary angiogram, had evidence of atherosclerosis involving\nmore than 40% of the interrogated vessel length and 73% had positive\nremodeling with preserved lumen size.51 These patients were classified as\nhaving non-obstructive CHD. 2.1.4.", "chunk_order": 16}

Unique Gender Specific Cardiac Issues\n2.1.5.1. Non-obstructive CHD\nDefinitions for non obstructive CHD differ. According to the Veteran Affairs\nClinical Assessment Reporting, and Tracking (CART) Program, based on the\ncoronary angiographic findings, non-obstructive CHD may be defined as:52\n\u2022\ncoronary artery stenosis \u2265 20% but < 50% in the left main coronary artery\n\u2022\na stenosis \u2265 20% but < 70% in any other epicardial coronary artery\nIn the WISE study, non-obstructive CHD was defined as at least one coronary\nstenosis \u2265 20% but < 50% luminal narrowing while obstructive CHD was\ncoronary stenosis \u2265 50%.37 A < 20% luminal narrowing was defined as\n\u201cNormal\u201d. Persons with non-obstructive CHD may have atheromatous\nplaques occurring in \u201cclumps\u201d with positive remodelling or as diffuse\ninvolvement of the vessel wall.35,51\nNon-obstructive CHD is more common in women.37,53 Patients with non-\nobstructive CHD may present as stable angina, ACS and sudden death.37\nThe prognosis of this condition is not benign. Compared to persons with no\napparent coronary lesions (< 20% luminal narrowing) non-obstructive CHD\nwas associated with significantly higher risk of MI and all cause mortality in\nboth gender.37,54\nIn the WISE study, symptomatic women with non-obstructive CHD but who\nhad exercise induced myocardial ischemia documented by MRI had a 3 year\nevent rate of 43% when compared to 13% in symptomatic women with no\ndemonstrable myocardial ischemia.55\nIn a systemic review, 7% of patients presenting with MI had non-obstructive\ncoronary arteries.56 A third of patients presented with STEMI and two-thirds\nwith NSTEMI. About 40% of the patients were women with a mean age of 54\nyears. Compared with MI due to obstructive coronary artery disease, these\npatients tended to be younger, females and have less hyperlipidemia.", "chunk_order": 17}

The\none-year all-cause mortality in patients with MI due to non-obstructive disease\nwas 4.7% compared to 6.7% for those with MI and obstructive coronary\narteries.56\nNon-obstructive CHD is associated with limitations in flow reserve at the\ncoronary microvascular level. However, little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms\ncontributing to myocardial ischemia in these subjects. The etiology appears\ndiverse, multifactorial and may involve more than one mechanism.57,58\n2.1.5.1.1. Management\nThere are no randomized trials on optimal prevention and treatment strategies\nfor non obstructive CHD. In patients with evidence of atherosclerosis, statins\nand ACE-I have been beneficial against progression of disease in short term\ntrials.37 \u03b2-blockers have been shown to give more relief of angina compared to\ncalcium channel blockers. Imipramine has also been shown to provide\nsymptom relief.37\n2.1.5.2. Cardiac Syndrome X\nCardiac Syndrome X is angina in the absence of obstructive CHD (< 20%\nluminal narrowing). There is however, a wide variation and lack of consensus\non its definition.59 There is also considerable overlap with non-obstructive\nCHD.59\nA proposed more precise definition of Cardiac Syndrome X entails the\nfollowing criteria:60-62\n\u2022\nExercise-induced, angina-like chest discomfort\n\u2022\nST-segment depression during spontaneous or stress-induced typical\nchest pain\n\u2022\nNormal epicardial coronary arteries at angiography\n\u2022\nNo spontaneous or inducible epicardial coronary artery spasm upon\negonovine or acetylcholine provocation\n\u2022\nAbsence of cardiac or systemic diseases associated with microvascular\ndysfunction such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or diabetes\nRecently a modified definition that includes evidence of ischemia in any form\nof functional testing (exercise stress test, stress echocardiography, SPECT,\nCMR, positron emission tomography, [PET] or intracoronary Doppler\nultrasound) has been proposed.60,61\nThere are several groups of patients who have angina-like chest pain and\nnormal coronary arteries at angiography but fail to meet one of the above\ncriteria. Examples include those with angina predominantly at rest, those with\ndiabetes or hypertension, or those with lack of ST depression on ECG during\nangina. It remains unclear whether the pathogenesis of angina in these patients is the\nsame as in patients who fall under the strict definition of Cardiac Syndrome\nX.60\nCardiac Syndrome X is more common in women than men; about 70% of\npatients are women who are approaching or are post-menopausal.60,62,63\nAbout 50% of women undergoing coronary angiography for chest pain do not\nhave major obstructive CHD.64 In early CHD, men have higher degrees of\natheroma and epicardial endothelial dysfunction, whereas women have more\ndisease of the microvasculature.65\nIn symptomatic patients with \u201cnormal\u201d coronary arteries, further tests for\nmyocardial ischemia (stress contrast echocardiogram or preferably\nmyocardial perfusion scans such as CMR/SPECT) may be warranted.

Treatment of\nheart failure is as outlined in section 2.1.5.6.1, pg 41. About 3.5% of patients\nhowever, suffer a recurrence of TCM.84\n2.1.5.4. Spontaneous Coronary Dissection\nSpontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is a very rare condition with\nan incidence of 0.07-1.1% of all coronary angiograms performed.88 The\nprevalence may be as high as 24% in women < 50 years of age who present\nwith MI.89 It affects predominantly young females - 70-80% are women and the\nmean age at presentation was 42 years.88,90 In one series however,\n62.3% of women who had SCAD were post menopausal.91\nThey usually present as an ACS \u2013 almost 50% as STEMI.

Cardiac Arrhythmias\nWomen tend to have a higher prevalence of sick sinus syndrome,\ninappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia,\nidiopathic right ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmic events in the long QT\nsyndrome.93\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia. It is\n1.5 more frequent in men than women but in those over 70 years old, the\nprevalence is similar in both gender probably because of the longer average\nlifetime of women.94,95 Women are more likely to experience an impaired\nquality of life with longer and more symptomatic episodes and frequent\nrecurrences.96,97 In subjects older than 75 years of age, female sex has been\nassociated with an additional risk of stroke.98 A recent study found that\npatients with non valvular AF had a high prevalence of left ventricular\nhypertrophy (LVH), which was related to female gender, older age,\nhypertension, and previous MI.99 There is also a strong association between\nAF and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).100\nWomen have a lower propensity to ventricular arrhythmias. However, women\nwith CHD have been noted to have more easily inducible ventricular\narrhythmias101,102 and those with congestive heart failure have a higher\nfrequency of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).103\nWomen have faster resting heart rates yet longer QTc intervals.94,104,105 They\nare more prone to develop torsades de pointes during administration of\ncardiovascular drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization (QT interval).106,107\nIn the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) study108 two factors\nsignificantly increased the hazard ratio (HR) for arrhythmic death or\nresuscitated cardiac arrest in non-randomized patients given anti-arrhythmic\ndrugs.", "chunk_order": 21}

Epidemiology\nStroke is now the leading cause of death in women worldwide and has been\nprojected to remain an important cause of mortality till 2030.14,136 However in\nthe US and UK, it is the second most important cause of death after CHD.22,137\nWomen have a higher lifetime risk of stroke than men and are on average\nabout 4 years older at stroke onset than men.23,138,139 (\u2248 75 years compared\nwith 71 years) In younger and middle-aged groups, age-specific incidence\nrates of stroke in women are much lower than men but in the older age groups\n(> 75 years), incidence rates are approximately equal or even higher than in\nmen.140,141 Women are more likely to die or have disability following a stroke\nthan men.12,13 This could be due to their older age at presentation and their\npre-stroke disability which is greater than that of men.13\n2.2.2. Presenting Symptoms\nIn general, there are no gender differences in the clinical presentation of\nstroke although women report a higher frequency of headache and facial\nsensory deficits and men have more prodromal symptoms and gait\ndisturbances.142-144\n2.2.3. Risk Factors\nWomen and men share many common risk factors for stroke although there\nare gender differences in the prevalence of the different risk factors.145 (Table\n6, pg 43) Women are more likely to have AF and hypertension, whereas men\nare more likely to have a history of CHD, MI, peripheral arterial disease,\ndiabetes, alcohol and tobacco use.146,147 Diabetes and metabolic syndrome\n(Met S) have a greater effect on stroke risk in women.148,149\nOther stroke risk factors include:-\n\u2022\nAF\n\u2022\nCarotid artery disease\n\u2022\nTransient ischaemic attacks\n\u2022\nFamily history of premature stroke- Ischemic strokes tend to occur in\nfamilies.150,151 A meta \u2013 analysis found that female probands were\nmore likely to have a positive family history of stroke in any parent than\nwere male probands and were also more likely to have a history of stroke\nin their mothers than fathers152,153\n\u2022\nPrevious history of stroke154,155\n2.2.3.1.

Migraine with visual aura\nincreases the risk of stroke.161-163 This risk is higher in current cigarette\nsmokers and current users of oral contraceptives.163\n2.2.4. Diagnosis and Management\nMost studies have found no gender differences in terms of stroke types,\nalthough some studies have found an increase in subarachnoid and\ncardio-embolic strokes in females.13\nThere are no gender differences in the way strokes are diagnosed and\nmanaged. Please refer to Malaysian CPG on Management of Ischemic Stroke\n(2012). 2.3. Peripheral Arterial Disease\nThe prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is lower in women under\n50 years of age but it increases with age and in those over 80 years, the\nprevalence is as high as in men. Even for the same disease states, women\nhave poorer prognosis with event rates that are higher than men especially\nwhen the ankle brachial index (ABI) is low.164-167 Women have an increased\nrisk of MI, cardiovascular and total mortality.165-167 They also have faster\nfunctional decline and greater mobility loss than men with PAD.168\n2.3.1.

The diagnosis of PAD may be objectively confirmed by the\nmeasurement of the ABI by Doppler ultrasound. The presence of PAD\nindicates a high risk individual and alters the intensity of risk factor\nmodification. 2.3.3. Management\nPatients with intermittent claudication should undergo a supervised exercise\nprogram to improve symptoms of claudication and exercise performance.164\nWomen however, respond less well to exercise training. Treatment options include medical therapy, angioplasty and surgery. Patients\nwith PAD whether symptomatic or not, should be treated as aggressively as\npatients with CHD with risk factor modification, anti-platelet agents (aspirin or\nclopidogrel) statins, \u03b2-blockers and ACEI.170-181\nAfter adjusting for risk factors, the following drugs have been found to be\nbeneficial in reducing mortality:170\n\u2022\nStatins HR; 0.46\n\u2022\n\u03b2-blockers HR = 0. 68\n\u2022\nAspirin HR = 0.72\n\u2022\nACEI HR = 0.80\nA phosphodiesterase III inhibitor (cilostazol) has been shown to improve\nexercise performance and quality of life in symptomatic patients but there is\nno data that it results in a reduction of adverse cardiovascular events.182,183\nThe use of \u03b2-blockers has previously been discouraged in the presence of\nPAD because of the possibility of worsening limb ischaemia. However a meta-analysis has shown that these drugs can be safely used in\nstable patients with mild to moderate symptoms of PAD.180 A more recent\nreview showed that \u03b2-blockers do not adversely affect walking distance, calf\nblood flow, calf vascular resistance and skin temperature in persons with\nintermittent claudication although most of the trials done were small, of poor\nquality and done more than 20 years ago.180 Thus the presence of stable PAD\nis not a contraindication for the use of \u03b2-blockers in patients with CHD. Symptomatic patients should be considered for intervention \u2013 angioplasty or\nsurgery. The diagnosis can be confirmed with either a magnetic resonance\nangiogram (MRA) or CT angiography (CTA) prior to intervention.

OTHER DISEASES WITH INCREASED RISK FOR\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE\n3.1. Connective Tissue Disease and the Heart\nPatients with connective tissue disease especially SLE, rheumatoid arthritis\nand systemic vasculitis are at increased risk for CVD.188-193 This excess risk of\npremature CVD is seen most commonly in SLE where CVD is the third most\ncommon cause of death.188 The CVD risk is 5-6 times greater in women\nespecially in those aged 35-44 years where the risk may be as high as 50\ntimes the general population.189,190 The causes are multifactorial and include\nincreased prevalence of the traditional risk factors, impaired endothelial\nfunction, systemic inflammation and the presence of autoantibodies such as\nanti-phospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant which are associated\nwith increased thrombotic risk.188,191\nCardiovascular manifestations of rheumatological diseases include:\n\u2022\nMyocardial- congestive heart failure, LVH, diastolic dysfunction,\nmyocardial fibrosis, amyloidosis\n\u2022\nPericardial \u2013 pericardial effusion, pericarditis\n\u2022\nValvular \u2013 Libman-Sacks vegetation, valvular regurgitation, valvular\nnodules\n\u2022\nArrhythmic \u2013 SCD, ventricular arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias,\natrioventricular block\n\u2022\nVascular \u2013 atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, vasculitis, thrombosis\nPatients with connective tissue disease should have their CV risk assessed\nand have their CV risk factors addressed according to guidelines. Some of the\ndrugs used for the treatment of these rheumatological disorders may have\ncardiac effects which also have to be addressed.194-197\n3.2. Cancer and the Heart\nChemotherapeutic agents have potential cardiotoxicity. In symptomatic\npatients, chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is defined as a decrease in\nLVEF by \u2265 5% to < 55%. In asymptomatic individuals, it is defined as a\ndecrease in LVEF by \u2265 10% to < 55%.198 Cardiotoxicity may be:\n\u2022\nIrreversible \u2013 type 1 (e.g. anthracycline induced toxicity)\n\u2022\nReversible \u2013 type 2 (e.g. herceptin induced toxicity)\nVascular toxicity is a recognized side-effect of some chemotherapeutic agents\nespecially the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This includes serious arterial\nthrombotic events such as acute MI, stroke and acute ischemic limb.199\nRadiation also causes significant cardiac toxicity after a long latent period\neven more so if the doses exceed 30 Gy.200 Radiation-induced heart disease,\nto date, remains significant as most patients currently seen are those who had\nhigher exposures 20-30 years ago.201 Radiation also induces and accelerates\natherosclerosis on top of traditional risk factors.202,203\nFor the management of patients on potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic\nagents, see Appendix 1, pg 89.

Infections and the Heart\n3.3.1. Influenza\nClinical trials have shown an association between a recent respiratory\ninfection and acute MI.204 In a recent study done in UK and Hong Kong, there\nwas strong evidence for a link between influenza and MI associated deaths\nand hospitalizations in both regions.205 A meta-analysis of 5 published\nrandomized clinical trials of 6735 patients showed that influenza vaccination\nwas associated with a lower risk of composite cardiovascular events.206 The\ngreatest treatment effect was seen among the highest-risk patients with more\nactive coronary disease. In a case-control study done in Australia, influenza\ndid not predict MI but vaccination was found to be protective.207 This protective\neffect is comparable to that of currently accepted therapies for secondary\nprevention of MI. It is advisable that high risk CVD patients receive annual influenza\nvaccination. However, to date, there is no supportive epidemiological data\nfrom tropical regions. 3.3.2. Periodontal Disease\nA number of observational studies have shown that there is an association\nbetween periodontal disease (PD) and CVD although the evidence for a\ncausal relationship is still controversial. Treatment of PD has been shown to result in improvement in surrogate\nmarkers of inflammation and endothelial function but there is no data that it\ncan prevent CVD.208-210\nMaintaining good dental hygiene and regular dental visits are recommended. 3.3.3. Human Immunodeficiency Virus\nStudies have shown that HIV infected individuals of both gender, are at\nincreased risk of premature CVD.211-214 Atherosclerosis tends to be diffuse,\ncircumferential and is often accelerated.215-219 The reasons for this increased\nCVD risk are multifactorial and includes systemic immune activation resulting\nin endothelial activation and atherosclerosis, metabolic derangements due to\nanti-retroviral therapy and also the high prevalence of traditional risk factors\nsuch as smoking and obesity in these patients.220-222 This increased CVD risk\npersists even after adjustment for Framingham risk factors, other co\nmorbidities and substance use. All HIV infected individuals should be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle\nwith CV risk factor modifications. 3.4. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)\nOSA is a sleep disorder associated with high blood pressure, CVD, and/or\nobesity. Observational studies seem to suggest a causal relationship between\nOSA and CVD although the data is not conclusive.223,224\nIt occurs more frequently in men than women - due to differences in obesity\nand the distribution of adipose tissue, upper-airway anatomy and muscle\nfunction, control of ventilation, and the effect of sex hormones and leptin.224-226\nIt is likely that OSA may be underdiagnosed in women.227 Observational\nstudies indicate that untreated severe OSA is an independent predictor of\ncardiovascular mortality in women.228 However, there are no randomised\ncontrolled trials to support this.", "chunk_order": 29}

Management of OSA includes general measures such as weight reduction,\navoidance of alcohol and sedative drugs in the evening.224 The use of\ncontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves quality of life, reduces\napnoeic spells, daytime somnolence, and blood pressure. The benefits of\nCPAP in preventing CVD remains unresolved.224,227,229\nRegistry data indicate that CPAP is associated with reduced all-cause\nmortality in middle-aged and elderly men but there was no significant effect in\nwomen.228 However, a recent randomized trial in patients with systolic heart\nfailure found that adaptive servo-ventilation actually increased all cause and\ncardiovascular mortality.230\nKey Messages:\nOther diseases that that are associated with an increased CV Risk in\nwomen include:\n\u2022\nConnective tissue diseases (especially rheumatoid arthritis, SLE and\nsystemic vasculitis) and the drugs that are used to treat these\ndiseases\n\u2022\nChemotherapy and radiation induced cardio toxicity\n\u2022\nInfections such as influenza, peridontal disease and HIV\n\u2022\nObstructive Sleep Apnoea\n4. CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS\n4.1. Personal History of CHD and/or CHD equivalents\nPersons with established CVD are at high risk for recurrent vascular events. In the GRACE registry, the 6 month risk of CV death and major CV event rate\nafter an ACS, was 5-8% and 15-20% respectively.231 A study done in England\nshowed that following the first MI, the risk of a recurrent MI was highest during\nthe first year and the cumulative risk increased gradually thereafter. For\nwomen, the 1 and 7 year cumulative risk was 7.2% and 16.2% respectively\nwhich were higher than that in men (5.6% and 13.9% respectively).30 Older\nage, no revascularization procedures, and the presence of comorbidities were\nassociated with a higher recurrence risk.30\nIn patients with stable CHD, the 1 year rate of CV death was 1.9% and the rate\nof CV death, MI or stroke was 4.5%.232 Following a stroke, the risk of a\nrecurrent stroke was 8% and the risk of death 4.5%. The rates continued to\nincrease steadily up to 4 years.154,155\nPersons with CHD Equivalents are also at high risk for CV events. This\nincludes:\n\u2022\nCerebrovascular disease\n\u2022\nPeripheral arterial disease\n\u2022\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)\n\u2022\nMultiple risk factors that confer a 10 year FRS of > 20%233\nThe presence of vascular disease in any one of the vascular beds usually\nindicates co-existing disease in other parts of the vascular tree.

Age (and Menopause)\nThe age-specific incidence rates for CHD in women are lower than in men at\nevery age.22,234-237 The onset of CHD may be delayed by about 10 years in\nwomen.23,24,25\nAtherosclerosis starts in early adolescence and progresses throughout a\nwoman\u2019s lifetime, the rate of progression depending upon the presence and\nseverity of the risk factors. In mid-life, a woman\u2019s risk for CVD increases\ndramatically. This is due to:-\n\u2022\nthe effect of increasing age, an effect that is also similarly observed in\nmen\n\u2022\nthe hormonal imbalances that occur with the menopause, and\n\u2022\nan increase in the prevalence of risk factors for heart disease often seen\nin mid-life such as:-\n-\nobesity and changes in body fat distribution and storage from the\nhips to the waist- gynaecoid (subcutaneous fat) to an android\n(abdominal obesity) pattern\n-\nphysical inactivity\n-\ndyslipidaemia\n-\nhypertension\n-\nworsening glucose tolerance/ insulin resistance\n-\nlifestyle change associated with an increase in risk factors\nIt is still not clear if this increase in the prevalence of risk factors is due to\noestrogen deficiency or part of the \u201cageing\u201d process. Women who experience early menopause are at increased CVD risk. When\ncompared to those with a natural menopause, women with:\n\u2022\nearly menopause--before their 46th birthday--are twice as likely to suffer\nfrom CHD and stroke. This finding is independent of age, race/ethnicity\nand traditional risk factors.238\n\u2022\nendogenous oestrogen deficiency had more than 7-fold increase in\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) risk in the Women\u2019s Ischemia Syndrome\nEvaluation (WISE) study.239\nOther studies have also shown that menopause before the age of 50, either\nspontaneous or surgically induced, is associated with an increased risk of\nCVD.240,241 This risk is mainly for CHD and not stroke.

This effect is more marked in women than men, particularly after the\nmenopause. Menopause causes an increase in total adiposity and a\nredistribution of fat to the abdominal region.321,322 In a prospective clinical study\nof older women followed up for more than 6 years, it was found that Met S and\nhigh waist-to-hip ratio were associated with increased risk of CV events.323\nThe \u2018clustering\u2019 of metabolic abnormalities that occur in the same individual\nappears to confer increased risk of future development of CVD and T2DM. The presence of any one of the components should trigger further screening\nfor the other associated CV risk factors. Unfortunately, the value of Met S as a scientific concept remains controversial. Although several epidemiologic studies have identified an increased risk of\nCVD in individuals with Met S,324-330 the presence of Met S does not predict an\nelevated CHD risk beyond the sum of its components.327,331\nThe traditional risk assessment algorithms are recommended to quantify\nglobal CVD risk. Excess abdominal adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance,\ncreating an atherogenic inflammatory milieu, characterized by high levels of\nC-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers (e.g., fibrinogen,\nplasminogen activator inhibitor-1, cytokines, and adhesion molecules).323-332\nEpidemiologic studies have shown a positive correlation between levels of\nthese biomarkers and CVD risk. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in particular, NASH (non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis), is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic\nsyndrome.333 Recent data suggest that NAFLD is linked to increased CV risk\nand is an independent CV risk predictor.334,335\n4.8. Overweight/ Obesity\nOverweight/ obesity increases CVD risk. With increasing body mass, both\nCHD mortality and all-cause mortality are increased.336,337 A recent study\nshowed a higher BMI, particularly \u2265 30, is also associated with a greater risk\nof SCD and it appeared to be a stronger risk factor in middle aged rather than\nolder women.338 Many CVD risk factors (such as dyslipidaemia, glucose\nintolerance and hypertension) are associated with obesity. With increasing\ndegrees of overweight/ obesity, there is an increased likelihood of developing\nthese risk factors. In Malaysia, in just 9 years from 2006 to 2015, there was a further increase\nin the prevalence of obese and overweight males and females (Table 10, pg\n61 and Figure 3A and B, pg 62).296,339 The prevalence of obesity is higher in\nMalaysian women than men.275\nTable 10: Prevalence of Overweight/Obesity in NHMS III296 (2006) and\nNHMS V275 (2015)\nAdults\nOverweight\nBMI 25 \u2013 29.9 kg/m2\nObese\nBMI > 30kg/m2\nNHMS III296\nNHMS V275\nNHMS III296\nMales\n29.7%\n31.6%\n10.0%\n15.0%\nFemales\n28.6%\n28.3%\n17.4%\n20.6%\nOverall\n29.1%\n30.0%\n14.0%\n17.7%\nNHMS V275\nThe prevalence shown above uses the international definition of overweight/\nobesity.

The reason for this lower\ncut-off points is because Asians have a higher CVD risk at lower BMI.341,342\nFurthermore, Asians also have a higher abdominal adiposity compared to\nCaucasians for the same BMI.343\nWith increasing age, there is an increased prevalence of overweight and\nobese individuals especially in females.

Mood disturbances, mostly severe depression, are prevalent in women with\nPCOS and contribute to impaired quality of life, fatigue, sleep disturbances,\nphobia, appetite changes, and binge eating resulting in higher BMI and\ngreater insulin resistance and CVD risk factors than non-depressed women\nwith PCOS.353\nWomen with PCOS often have subclinical, early coronary and other vascular\ndisease documented by coronary angiography, carotid artery scanning and\ncoronary artery calcium measurement.354-356 Echocardiographic abnormalities\ninclude increased left atrial size and left ventricular mass index, lower left\nventricular ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction.357,358\nTable 11: Beneficial effects of a 10% weight loss in the obese individual351\nMortality\n>20% \u2193 total\n>30% \u2193 diabetes related\n>40% \u2193 obesity related cancer\nBlood Pressure\n10 mmHg \u2193 systolic\n20 mmHg \u2193 diastolic\nDiabetes\n30-50% \u2193 in fasting glucose\n50% \u2193 in developing diabetes\n15% \u2193 in HBA1c\nLipids\n10% \u2193 total cholesterol\n15% \u2193 LDL-cholesterol\n30% \u2193 triglycerides\n8% \u2191 HDL-cholesterol\nThe WISE Study found that women with PCOS have higher CV event rates,\nmultivessel CVD and lower survival compared with non-PCOS women.359\nAll women with PCOS should have CV risk assessed as follows360\n\u2022\nFamily history of early CVD\n\u2022\nCigarette smoking\n\u2022\nWaist circumference and BMI at each clinic visit\n\u2022\nComplete lipid profile every 2 years or sooner if weight gain occurs\n\u2022\nOGTT every 2 years or sooner if additional risk factors are identified\n\u2022\nBP check at each clinic visit\n\u2022\nAssess for OSA\n\u2022\nAssess for depression, anxiety, and quality of life\nWomen with PCOS with obesity, cigarette smoking, dyslipidaemia,\nhypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and subclinical vascular disease\nare at risk, whereas those with Met S and/or T2DM are at high risk for CVD.360\nFor overweight/ obese women with PCOS, a 5\u201310% weight loss should be\ntargeted.

Walking for at least 1 hour per week predicted lower CHD risk. Time spent walking was more important than walking pace.381 A recent large\nstudy showed that any physical activity was beneficial compared to inactivity\nin reducing CV risk.381 Among active women, moderate physical activity 4-6\ntimes per week had the best CV risk reduction compared to those who\nexercised daily.382\nThese benefits of physical activity were seen in all women irrespective of the\nbaseline CHD risk.383,384 A structured, moderate-intensity physical activity\nprogram was found to be beneficial even in sedentary men and women aged\n70 to 89 years.385\nObesity is often associated with physical inactivity and both independently\ncontribute to the development of CHD in women. Being physically active\nattenuates moderately but does not eliminate the adverse effects of obesity on\ncardiac risk.

Instead\nthere a small increased risk of stroke in post-menopausal women.250\nThere is some evidence that women who start treatment within the first 10\nyears of their menopause, seemed to have a small protection against death\nand MI, with no increased risk of stroke.251 However, even in this group, the\nrisk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is increased. This apparent benefit in\npreventing CVD in younger women should be considered alongside other\npossible benefits and emerging evidence of harm, including the risk of breast\ncancer, ovarian cancer, and DVT.

In non-pregnant women this\nshould not exceed 1 drink (10 g/day) per day.405-407 At moderate to high levels,\nthe risk of death is higher in women than in men, probably owing to increasing\nrisk of cancer and both haemorrhagic and ischemic strokes.408,409 Heavy\nconsumption of alcohol (3 or more drinks a day) is also related to\nhypertriglyceridemia, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and\nliver disease. When men and women consume the same amount of alcohol, women\nexperience higher blood alcohol concentrations. This is because women\nmetabolize\nethanol\ndifferently\nand\nhave\na\nlower\ngastric\nalcohol\ndehydrogenase activity, resulting in higher blood ethanol levels.

TOTAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT\nAll asymptomatic apparently healthy women \u2265 40 years of age should have\ntheir CV risk assessed. Women with established CV risk factors or family\nhistory of premature CVD can be assessed at a younger age. This should be\nan integral component of periodic health examinations of all women in\naddition to their regular gynaecological and breast examinations. Women can\ndo this CV risk assessment in government clinics for a nominal fee. CV risk refers to the likelihood of a woman developing a CV event, fatal or\nnon-fatal, over a defined period of time.

Women at high risk should\nundergo intensive lifestyle interventions and where appropriate, drug\ntherapies\n\u2022\nimprove physician recognition, detection and treatment of risk factors\nIdeally, the CV risk model should be based on data derived from the local\npopulation. Currently, we do not have such a CV risk score. The risk score that\nis widely used in Malaysia is the Framingham general CVD risk score tool for\nprimary care that assesses the 10 year risk of developing CVD.424 (Table 2, pg\n9 & 10) It provides sex-specific CVD risk scores and allows for the calculation\nof an individual\u2019s heart/vascular age.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION OF CVD\nIN WOMEN\nThe INTERHEART study found that 9 potentially modifiable factors accounted\nfor 96% of the population attributable risk of a first MI in women compared to\n93% among men.24,443 These 9 modifiable risk factors include dyslipidaemia,\nhypertension, diabetes, smoking, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors,\nregular physical exercise, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and\nregular alcohol consumption.24 Hypertension, diabetes, alcohol intake, and\nphysical activity were more strongly associated with MI in women compared to\nmen.24 Generally risk factors were more strongly associated with acute MI in\nyounger (< 60 years) compared to older (\u2265 60 years) women and men.24\nIn Malaysia, according to the NHMS IV (2011), almost half of women > 30\nyears are hypertensive, a third are obese and have high cholesterols and a\nfifth have diabetes.296 An earlier survey (NHMS III 2006) showed that women\ndisplayed a higher prevalence and a younger age shift in CV risk factor\nclustering.444\nIt was estimated that 90% of CHD events occurred in people with at least 1 CV\nrisk factor.445 Borderline CV risk factors contribute incrementally to this CVD\nrisk.445 As the number of risk factors increase, the CV risk also increases and\nsurvival decreases.440\nThus it is important to assess the global CVD risk since mildly raised levels of\nseveral risk factors, in the long term, will result in increased global CVD risk. All CVD risk factors should be identified and managed aggressively according\nto guidelines. 6.1. General Recommendations\nThe following healthy lifestyle measures are important in all women. By\nadopting a healthy lifestyle, women can reduce their CVD risk by as much as\n55%.440 A healthy life style has been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure in\npost-menopausal women even in the absence of antecedent CAD,\nhypertension and diabetes.446\n6.1.1. Nutrition\nKnowing how much calories one needs a day is a good start for healthy living. IIa, C\nI, B\nThis depends on several factors such as age, gender, BMI and level of\nphysical activity. Home cooked meals are preferable to eating out. A diet encompassing food from all the food groups is recommended. Healthy\nfood choices that reduce CVD risk should be encouraged.446-454\nGeneral recommendations should fit in with the local culture. Energy intake\nshould be adjusted to avoid overweight/ obesity.", "chunk_order": 48}

Replace saturated fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats whilst\nstill maintaining a nutritionally calorie adjusted diet. Reduce total fat < 30% of\nenergy, of which < 1/3 should be saturated.456,457\nCarbohydrates are either refined or complex. Complex carbohydrates (e.g. whole grains, peas, beans, lentils) are the preferred choice as they are\ndigested more slowly and supply a steady release of energy.455 Refined grains,\nsuch as white rice and white flour that have been processed, are deficient in\nmany nutrients and fibre unless enriched. Fibre makes one feel full and\nsatisfied longer and discourages over-eating. The effect of dietary soluble fiber on serum cholesterol levels has been\nextensively studied. Intakes of 9 to 16.5 g/day of a variety of soluble fibers\n(mostly psyllium and guar) produced net reductions in serum total and LDL\ncholesterol levels of 5.5% to 11% and 3.2% to 12.1%, respectively.458\nI, B\nI, B\nI, B\nSweets and sucrose-sweetened beverages should be discouraged.

It is\nrecommended that a qualified dietitian be involved in dietary counselling and\neducation.
