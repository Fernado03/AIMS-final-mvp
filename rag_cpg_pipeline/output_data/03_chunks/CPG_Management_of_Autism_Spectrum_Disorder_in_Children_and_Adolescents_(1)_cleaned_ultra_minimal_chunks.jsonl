Guidelines Development and Objectives\nGuidelines Development\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this Clinical Practice\nGuidelines (CPG) are staff of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of\nHigher Education Malaysia. A multidisciplinary review committee (RC) was\nactively involved during this CPG development process. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following databases:\nGuidelines International Network (G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, PUBMED,\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and International Health\nTechnology Assessment websites. A search strategy to cover all aspects\non management of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was developed in the\nMedline database and adapted to other databases. Search strategies were a\ncombination of MeSH and keyword searches including abbreviations (refer to\nAppendix 1 on an example of Search Strategy). The search was restricted to\nhuman studies, literature published in the English language and the last ten\nyears. If the evidence was insufficient, the period of publication was extended\nfor another ten years. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature\nand guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. All searches\nwere conducted from May 2012 till November 2013. Literature searches were\nrepeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process. The aim was to identify and include any further relevant papers published\nbefore 28 February 2014. Future CPG updates will consider evidence\npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be\nobtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to other CPGs on ASD such as i) Guidelines on\nTreatment, Diagnosis and Clinical Intervention for Children and Young People\nwith Autism Spectrum Disorder (SIGN 98-2007), ii) AMS-MOH Clinical Practice\nGuidelines 1/2010 - Autism Spectrum Disorders in Pre-school Children, iii)\nAutism Spectrum Disorder by the Ministry of Health New Zealand 2008, and\niv) Autism diagnosis in children and young people: Recognition, referral and\ndiagnosis of children and young people on the autism spectrum (NICE, 2011). These CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research\nand Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. A total of 27 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2) The DG members met 23 times throughout the\ndevelopment of these guidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by\nat least two DG members using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist,\npresented in evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed upon by\nboth the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations\nwere made by consensus of the DG and RC. These CPGs are based largely\non the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, with\nlocal practices taken into consideration.", "chunk_order": 2}

Introduction\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised\nby impairments in communication, behaviour and social functioning beginning\nin childhood. There is no local epidemiological study on ASD prevalence in\nMalaysia. However, in a feasibility study on the use of Modified Checklist for\nAutism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) among children of 18 to 36 months of age in child\nhealth clinics by Ministry of Health Malaysia, the prevalence of ASD in Malaysia\nwas approximately 1.6 in 1,000.1 In the USA, the overall prevalence of ASD is\n14.7 per 1,000 (one in 68) children aged 8 years and the prevalence shows an\nincreasing trend over the years.2\nClinicians have been seeing an increasing number of children with speech delay\nand social communication difficulties who require further assessment.", "chunk_order": 5}

Children\nwith speech delay and behavioural issues are frequently placed in special\neducation classes without an accurate diagnosis. While waiting for diagnosis to\nbe established, these children should be referred for the relevant interventions. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention of children with ASD is crucial for the\nbest outcome. The importance of early recognising and initiation of early referral\nto optimise the child\u2019s potential must be emphasised. This has prompted the need to produce a CPG for the wide usage of healthcare\nproviders in Malaysia as well as to provide assistance to parents of children with\nASD. It is hoped that this CPG can give a clear picture to primary care providers\nto direct these children in an efficient manner. Referral pathways to specialists\nand various interventionists have been outlined in this CPG in order to facilitate\nthis process. 2. Risk Factors\nThe aetiology of ASD is unclear. It is multi-factorial which includes both genetic\nvulnerability and environmental factors. Only risk factors deemed important by\nthe DG and RC are discussed here. a. Advancing Parental Age\nParental age is among the most consistently studied risk factor and the risk for\nASD increases with parental age. \u25cf\nMaternal age:\n\u25cb >35 years old vs 25 - 29 years old (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.19 to\n1.45)3, level II-2\n\u25cb >40 years old vs <30 years old (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.86)4, level\nII-2\n\u25cf\nPaternal age: compared to \u2264 29 years old,5, level II-2\n\u25cb 49 years old (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87)\n\u25cb \u2265 50 years old (OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.88)\n\u25cb \u2265 55 years old (OR = 4.36, 95% CI 2.09 to 9.09)\n\u25cf\nFirst born of mother aged >35 years old and father aged >40 years\nold vs parents aged 25 - 29 years old, adjusted OR = 3.1, 95% CI 2.0\nto 4.7.6, level II-2\nb. Prematurity (<37 weeks of gestation) in particular those born <33 weeks\nare at risk of developing ASD (OR = 5.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 27.7).4, level II-2\nc. Neonatal encephalopathy has OR for ASD ranging from 3.06 to 5.59. 4, level II-2\nd.", "chunk_order": 6}

Genetic Risk\nThe adjusted relative recurrence risk of ASD is increased with increasing\ngenetic relatedness:3, level II-2\n\u25cf\nMonozygotic twins\n=\n153.0 (95% CI 56.7 to 412.8)\n\u25cf\nDizygotic twins\n=\n8.2 (95% CI 3.7 to 18.1)\n\u25cf\nFull siblings\n=\n10.3 (95% CI 9.4 to 11.3)\n\u25cf\nMaternal half-siblings\n=\n3.3 (95% CI 2.6 to 4.2)\n\u25cf\nPaternal half-siblings\n=\n2.9 (95% CI 2.2 to 3.7)\n\u25cf\nCousins\n=\n2.0 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.2)\nThe RR of ASD for infants with multiple older affected siblings is significantly\n2.2 times higher than those who had only one older affected sibling.7, level II-2\ne. Peri-conceptional supplement\nUse of folic acid supplement in mothers around the time of conception (four\nweeks before and eight weeks after pregnancy)8, level II-2 or peri-conceptional\nprenatal vitamin intake (containing more iron, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and\n800 \u00b5g of folic acid as compared to ordinary multivitamins)9, level II-2 appears\nto offer some benefit especially in those who are genetically susceptible. f. Immunisation (Vaccination)\nBased on a Cochrane systematic review of 10 studies, no significant\nassociation was found between MMR immunisation and autism.10, level II-2\nIn another study, increasing exposure to antibody-stimulating proteins\nand polysaccharides in vaccines during the first two years of life was not\nassociated with risk of developing ASD.11, level II-2\nImmunisation is not associated with the development of autism spectrum\ndisorder. 3. Screening\nScreening for ASD is important as early detection enables early intervention\nand better outcomes. There are limited studies on the effectiveness of\nscreening tools for ASD in children. Three systematic reviews (SRs) found\nthat Checklist for Autism in Toddler (CHAT), Modified Checklist for Autism\nin Toddlers (M-CHAT) and Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)\nperformed better in the screening of young children for ASD. The primary\nstudies were inadequate with small sample sizes, lack of blinding between\nscreening and diagnosis, and largely did not follow up children with negative\nresults.12, level II-1; 13, level II-1; 14, level II-1\nIt is important to be aware that false positive or false negative results from\nany use of screening tests may cause unnecessary parental anxiety or delay\ncorrect diagnosis. The ultimate decision about the need for referral and further\nassessment should be made on clinical grounds. a. Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT)\nModified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) [Appendix 3] is a 23-item\nquestionnaire on child behaviour and development reported by parents for\nchildren aged 18 and 24 months of age.15, level III It has been translated into\nMalay and Chinese languages for local use in healthcare facilities in Malaysia.

The ICD and DSM categorical system classifications have led to development\nof the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Diagnostic\nInterview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO). Clinical\nexperience and professional training are crucial in order to establish the\ndiagnosis. Observation in different settings such as school and home may\nbe helpful. Besides ADI-R and DISCO, other ASD-diagnostic instruments that can be\nused to facilitate assessment are Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule\n(ADOS) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). ADOS is a reliable\ndiagnostic instrument to supplement clinical history. Refer to Appendix 8\nfor more details. a. Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)\nThis is a structured interview conducted with parents / carers of individuals\nfor assessment of ASD. It is used for diagnostic purpose for anyone with\na mental age of at least 18 months.

Parent Education and Support\nManaging children with ASD can be a huge challenge to their families. Children\nneed parental involvement and support in acquiring social and communication\nskills. Parents without proper training may contribute to the failure of children\napplying learnt skills outside the classrooms. Thus, parental involvement is\nimportant to ensure the continuity of intervention. A SR showed that parental training improved parent-child interaction\n(shared attention: SMD = 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.68 and parent synchrony:\nSMD = 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.23).
