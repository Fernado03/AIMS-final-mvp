The search was limited to literature published in the last ten\nyears, on humans and in English. If the evidence was insufficient, the\nperiod of publication was extended for another ten years. In addition, the\nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched to\nfurther identify relevant studies. Experts in the field were also contacted\nto identify further studies. All searches were conducted from 27 October\n2011 to 27 September 2012. Literature searches were repeated for all\nclinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing\nany relevant papers published before 31 July 2013 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off\ndate. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request\nfrom the CPG Secretariat.

The\nCPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. A total of 14 clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. (Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions)\nThe DG members met 28 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings.

This may arise as a result of biomechanical,\nbiochemical and/or genetic factors. The process may involve one or\nmultiple joints. In the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study, it was estimated that\n251 million people suffered from knee OA worldwide. Musculoskeletal\ndiseases which included OA was the second greatest cause of disability\nas measured by years lived with disability.1\nOA is prevalent in the ageing population. In 2010, WHO estimated that\n524 million people were aged 65 or older and this number is expected\nto triple which represents 16% of the world\u2019s population by 2050.2\nIn view of its potential public health burden and emergence of more\nrecent advances in the management of OA, it is timely to update the\nCPG on Management of OA 2002 using evidence-based methodology. It is hoped that this CPG serves as a useful guide in the daily practice\nof health care providers in various disciplines from the public, academic\nand private sectors. Management of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n2\n2. EPIDEMIOLOGY & RISK FACTORS\n2.1 Epidemiology\nThere is wide variability of OA prevalence depending on age, gender of\npopulation studied and case definition used. The most commonly used\ncase definition is radiographic OA, symptomatic OA and self-reported\nOA. Symptomatic OA is defined as the presence of the radiographic\nfeatures of OA in combination with symptoms attributable to it. Not all\nindividuals with radiographic OA have concomitant symptoms; thus\nradiographic OA has the highest prevalence.3, level III\na. Hand OA\nIn the Framingham Osteoarthritis Hand OA study, the mean baseline\nage was 58.9 years. The age-standardised prevalence of hand OA was\nhigher in women (44.2%) than men (37.7%). The prevalence was even\nhigher in erosive (9.9% vs 3.3%) and symptomatic (15.9% vs 8.2%)\nhand OA. Majority of women (96.4%) and men (91.4%) with hand OA\nat baseline showed progression at 9-year follow up.4, level II-2\nb. Hip OA\nThe prevalence of symptomatic hip OA in United States of America\n(USA) was 9.2% among adults age >45 with a slight female\npreponderance.5, level III In another study, the crude prevalence of\nradiographic hip OA in Chinese aged 60 - 89 years was 0.9% in women\nand 1.1% in men. Hip OA was 80 - 90% less frequent in the Chinese\nthan white persons in the USA.6, level III\nc. Knee OA\nIn the Johnston County OA Project of USA, the lifetime risk of developing\nsymptomatic knee OA in at least one knee was 44.7% (95% CI 40.0%\nto 49.3%) by age 85 years.", "chunk_order": 5}

Knee OA\nIn the Johnston County OA Project of USA, the lifetime risk of developing\nsymptomatic knee OA in at least one knee was 44.7% (95% CI 40.0%\nto 49.3%) by age 85 years. The lifetime risk is higher in those with\nhistory of knee injury and increased BMI.7, level II-2\nThe prevalence of symptomatic knee OA was 4.9% among adults age\n>26 years in the Framingham study,5, level III 16.7% among adults age\n>45 in the Johnston County study,7, level II-2 and 12.1% among adults\naged >60 in the NHANES III study.5, level III\nIn the Beijing Osteoarthritis Study of persons aged 60 years and above,\nthe prevalence of radiographic knee OA was 42.8% in women and\nManagement of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n3\n21.5% in men. Symptomatic knee OA occurred in 15.0% of women and\n5.6% of men. Compared with women of the same age in Framingham,\nwomen in Beijing had a higher prevalence of radiographic knee OA\n(prevalence ratio=1.45, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.60) and of symptomatic knee\nOA (prevalence ratio=1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.75). The prevalence of knee\nOA in Chinese men was similar to that in their white USA counterparts\n(prevalence ratio of 0.90 for radiographic OA and 1.02 for symptomatic\nOA). Possible explanations for these differences range from genetic\ndifferences to heavy physical activity among Chinese.8, level III\nIn the Community Orientated Program for the control of Rheumatic\nDisease (COPCORD) study in Malaysia which was initiated by ILAR\nand WHO, 9.3% of adult Malaysians had knee pain and more than half\nof those examined had clinical evidence of OA. The prevalence ranged\nfrom 1.1% to 5.6% in the various ethnic groups. This prevalence is likely\nto be an underestimate as the study only included those with pain in the\npast week and not all subjects with knee pain attended the subsequent\nmedical examination. Hip pain was less common, with only 2.2% of the\nstudy population affected.9, level III\nTo better understand the burden of disease, further epidemiological\nstudies are needed to obtain the prevalence and incidence of OA in\nMalaysia. 2.2 Risk Factors\nMultiple risk factors have been associated with the development and\nprogression of OA. The risk factors can be categorised as the following:-\na. Non-modifiable\n\u2022 Advancing age10, level II-2\n\u2022 Female [OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5 (case-control studies),\nOR=1.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.3 (cohort studies)]10, level II-2\n\u2022 Genetic influence on hand and knee OA in women ranges from\n39% to 65% (p<0.001)11, level II-2\n\u2022 Presence of Heberden\u2019s nodes in hand OA increase the risk for\nfuture knee OA, OR=1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.810, level II-2\nb.", "chunk_order": 6}

Management of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n5\n3. CLASSIFICATION\nThere are various methods of classifying OA. The disease can be\nclassified by the joint involved such as hand, hip and knee. It can also\nbe classified by aetiology as shown below:-\na. Primary or Idiopathic\nPrimary OA includes generalised OA, a condition associated with\nHeberden\u2019s nodes and polyarticular disease. It occurs especially in the\nhand, with a female preponderance and has a high prevalence in first\ndegree relatives.13\nb. Secondary\ni. Metabolic such as acromegaly, haemachromatosis and\nchondrocalcinosis\nii. Anatomic such as slipped femoral epiphysis, Legg-Perthes\ndisease, congenital dislocation of the hip, leg length inequality,\nhypermobility syndromes and avascular necrosis\niii. Trauma such as joint injury and fracture through a joint or\nosteonecrosis\niv. Inflammatory such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy\nand septic arthritis\nManagement of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n6\n4. DIAGNOSIS\nOA is frequently diagnosed by an overall clinical impression. However,\nthere are diagnostic criteria by American College of Rheumatology and\nEuropean League Against Rheumatism which can be used as a guide. 4.1 Clinical Features\nClinical features of OA depend on the extent of the disease. Patients\nmay have radiological evidence of OA without clinical symptoms. Symptoms of OA include:-\ni. Joint pain - Pain is the most common presenting complaint. It is\nusually insidious in onset, of variable intensity through the day,\nmay be intermittent and relapsing, increased by joint use and\nimpact and relieved by rest. Night pain may occur in severe OA. Refer to Appendix 3 for possible mechanisms of pain in OA. ii.", "chunk_order": 7}

It is\nusually insidious in onset, of variable intensity through the day,\nmay be intermittent and relapsing, increased by joint use and\nimpact and relieved by rest. Night pain may occur in severe OA. Refer to Appendix 3 for possible mechanisms of pain in OA. ii. Stiffness - Stiffness may be defined as a sensation of tightening\nof the involved joint that usually occurs after inactivity, such as in\nthe morning or when arising after sitting for a prolonged period. In contrast to inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis,\nstiffness in OA usually lasts only a few minutes and almost always\nless than 30 minutes. iii. Swelling - There may be fullness and swelling of the joint with or\nwithout associated warmth and loss of function. iv. Gait disturbance - OA of weight-bearing joints if significant is\nassociated with gait disturbance, increased muscle spasm and\na reduced quality of life. An affected knee or hip can produce a\nprominent limp. Impaired function of a weight-bearing joint will\ncause added stress on the contralateral weight-bearing joints, for\nexample a patient with impaired right knee function and pain will\nhave difficulty with the left hip and vice versa. v. Bony swelling - In hand OA, hypertrophic bone formation in the\ninterphalangeal joint may result in reduced dexterity and difficulty\nin performing fine movements such as sewing. OA of the first\ncarpometacarpal (CMC) joint may result in writing difficulties. vi. Loss of muscle bulk - Inactivity secondary to pain, for example in\nknee OA, may lead to significant weakness and loss of quadriceps\nmuscle bulk. vii. Limb deformity - Enlargement of the knee joints may occur resulting\nin increasing deformity of the knees, such as \u2018knock knees\u2019 (valgus)\nor \u2018bowing\u2019 (varus). viii. Clicking or grinding sensation - There may be a clicking or grinding\nsensation with joint motion resulting in discomfort or pain. Management of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n7\nix. Instability - The sensation of instability in the knee or hip may cause\nthe patient to seek assistance in ambulation, such as using a cane\nor crutch. Signs of OA include:-\ni. Gait - OA of weight-bearing joints, for example the hip, knee, ankle\nand/or foot leads to altered gait patterns. ii. Tenderness - Tenderness of soft tissues such as synovium,\ncapsule, bursae and periarticular muscles, or periosteum at the\ninsertion of capsule or ligaments may be present. iii. Joint swelling - Enlargement of the joint may be due to synovitis,\nsynovial effusion or bone enlargement. iv. Crepitus - Grinding, crunching or cracking may be present over a\njoint with OA. v. Limitation of motion - There may be loss of function with reduced motion\nas a result of synovitis/effusion or periarticular soft tissue contractures. vi.", "chunk_order": 8}

However, it is most notable in the interphalangeal joints\nof the hands with enlargement and subluxation, the first CMC\njoint, the knees (varus/valgus) or the hips (shortened extremity). Deformity may be associated with joint fusion or instability. 4.2 Diagnostic Criteria\nThe diagnostic criteria for classification of OA are based on the American\nCollege of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

It involves nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment. Refer to Appendix 9\nfor checklist on management of OA. 6.1 Non-Pharmacological Treatment\na. Education\nPatient education is an important non-pharmacological approach in\nthe management of OA. There are various types of patient education\nprogrammes and they have to be tailored according to the individual\nneeds, goals and functional capabilities. It should include information\nof the diagnosis, nature of the disease, therapeutic options and\nthe importance of ongoing patient participation in the disease\nmanagement.22 - 25, level I Patients who have an understanding of the\ndisease tend to cope better and report less pain.26 The most important\ngoal is to instill a positive attitude.

Lifestyle Modification\nLifestyle medicine is defined as the application of environmental,\nbehavioural, medical and motivational principles to the management of\nlifestyle related health problems.27, level III\nLifestyle modification involves initiating and maintaining lifestyle\nchanges. In hip and knee OA, behavioural changes focus on weight\nreduction and physical activity or exercise. i. Weight Reduction\nObesity is an important modifiable risk factor for the development and\nprogression of knee OA. Weight reduction is beneficial in pain reduction\nand improvement of function.28 - 30, level I In a RCT done by Messier et\nal., each unit of weight loss will result in 4-fold reduction in the load\nexerted on the knee per step during daily activities.31, level I There is no\nevidence available to support the effect of weight loss in hip OA.32\nManagement of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n15\nRecommendation 3\n\u2022 Weight reduction should be emphasised in the management of\npatients with knee osteoarthritis and who are overweight. (Grade A)\nii. Physical Activity\nExercise is effective in reducing pain in hip and knee OA. The frequency,\nintensity, duration and rate of progression of exercise can vary. The\namount and intensity of exercise required is uncertain. In order to\nimprove adherence, the following are suggested:-\ni. Individualised exercise programme\nii. Graded type activity\niii. Amount of activity based on personal goal setting\niv. Feedback on progress\nv. Appropriate positive reinforcement\nvi. Problem solving skills incorporated\nThe EULAR 2013 Recommendations on the Non-Pharmacologic\nTreatment for Hip and Knee OA recommends that the intensity and\nduration of exercise should increase over time.32\nIn hip and knee OA, pacing of activities and/or integrating Activities of\nDaily Living (ADL) as part of the exercise regime is more effective than\nusual care but not comparable to standardised exercise.32\nIn knee OA, aerobic training (walking) is effective in reducing pain\n(ES=0.48, 95% CI 01.13 to 0.43) and improving physical function\n(ES=0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.58).33, level I The evidence for mixed\nexercise programmes, including strengthening, aerobic and flexibility\ncomponents, in patients with knee OA is conflicting. One type of\nexercise has not been shown to be better than another (strength,\naerobic or mixed exercises).32\nRegular non-competitive exercise does not exacerbate OA nor increase\nthe likelihood of requiring joint replacement. c. Physiotherapy\nPhysiotherapy can improve muscle strength, balance, coordination and\njoint mobility. It should be started as soon as possible to improve pain\nand physical capacity. Management of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n16\ni. Exercise\nExercise programmes should be individualised while taking into\nconsideration patient\u2019s preference and ability to perform the activities. Land-based exercises include joint range of movement (ROM), muscle\nstrengthening and low impact aerobic exercises. They should be\nsupervised and done regularly (refer to Appendix 4 and Appendix 5).", "chunk_order": 13}

Such exercise has short term benefits in reducing pain (SMD= -0.40,\n95% CI -0.50 to -0.30) and improving physical function (SMD= -0.37,\n95% CI -0.49 to -0.25) in knee OA.33, level I However in hip OA, the benefit\nis only seen in pain reduction (SMD= -0.38, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.09) but\nnot in physical function (SMD= -0.10, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.32).34, level I\nAquatic exercise may be advantageous for OA patients. A Cochrane\nSR showed improvement in pain (SMD=0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35)\nand quality of life (SMD=0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61) for three months\nonly in hip and knee OA. However, there was no statistically significant\ndifference on walking ability.35, level I\nIn the same review, aquatic exercise was better than land-based\nexercises in reducing pain in knee OA (SMD=0.86, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.47). However, there was no effect on walking ability and stiffness.35, level I\nii. Transcutaneous Electrostimulation (TENS)\nThere is a lack of evidence to support the use of transcutaneous\nelectrostimulation for knee OA from the most recent Cochrane\nSR.36, level I However, the ACR 2012 recommends the use of TENS for\npatients with chronic moderate to severe pain who are not suitable for\ntotal knee arthroplasty.37\niii. Thermotherapy\nThermotherapy is commonly used in physical rehabilitation for OA\npatients. ACR recommends the use of thermal agents for hip and knee\nOA in combination with exercise supervised by a physiotherapist.37\nA SR showed that cold pack usage did not show a significant effect in\npain reduction in knee OA (WMD= -1.60, 95% CI -4.53 to1.33).38, level I\nManagement of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n17\niv.

Occupational Therapy\nOccupational therapy aims to improve health, prevent disability and help\nindividuals to achieve their optimum functional level and independence\nin performing ADL. The evidence suggests that people with pain, difficulty and frustration\nin performing daily activities and work tasks should be referred early\nto an occupational therapist for splinting, joint protection training and\nassistive device provision.40\nA NICE-commissioned CPG recommends that assistive devices such\nas walking sticks and tap turners should be considered as adjuncts to\ncore treatment in OA patients with specific ADL problems.40 The height\nof the walking stick handle should be at the wrist level when the user is\nstanding. It is important to prescribe appropriate assistive device with\nproper training to the patients (refer to Appendix 6). Joint protection and home exercises (JPE) are used in the treatment of\nhand OA. JPE increases grip strength significantly by 25% (p<0.0005)\nand global hand function by 65% (p<0.05).41, level I Refer to Appendix 7 for\nJoint Protection Principles.

Bicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty\nThis type of surgery is an alternative to TKR when advanced medial\nor lateral compartment OA is associated with significant patellofemoral\nOA. 8.5 Arthrodesis\nThe aim of arthrodesis or joint fusion is to fuse the diseased joint in\nan optimal position. This would make the joint stiff but stable. The\nmost common indication for knee arthrodesis is pain and significant\nligamentous instability in an unreconstructable knee following an\ninfection at the site of a knee arthroplasty. Arthrodesis of the knee can\nprovide a stable, painless extremity for young active patients. In general, arthrodesis is not the preferred surgical option in OA. Recommendation 15\n\u2022 Arthroscopic lavage and debridement should not be offered as\na treatment in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee except in selected\nconditions*.

Management of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n31\nb. Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI)\nAutologous chondrocyte implantation is an approach that has been\nused to treat symptomatic knee cartilage defects. The aim of this\ntreatment is to replenish cartilage through the recruitment of progenitor\ncells as potential cartilage precursors, allowing the development into\nchondrogenic cells and finally cartilage.110, level I\nMost of the studies on usage of ACI were done on younger age patients\nwith articular cartilage damage due to secondary causes of OA such as\nsports injury or trauma. Hence, there is a lack of evidence presently to\nrecommend the use of ACI in the treatment of primary OA. c. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)\nPlatelet rich plasma (PRP) is a natural concentrate of autologous blood\ngrowth factors studied in different fields of medicine in order to test its\npotential to enhance tissue regeneration. The preliminary short-term results within 3 to 6 months indicate that\ntreatment with autologous PRP intra-articular injections may be useful\nfor early OA, aiming to reduce pain and improve knee function and\nquality of life.111, level III However, there is no further improvement after 6\nmonths.111, level III; 112, level II-2\nDue to a lack of available evidence, the CPG is unable to recommend the\nuse of intra-articular stem cells, autologous chondrocyte implantation or\nplatelet-rich plasma in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Management of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n32\n9. REFERRAL\n9.1 Rheumatology Referral\nOsteoarthritis is one of the major causes of disability in adults. Early\ndiagnosis and intervention are important to minimise the impact of\nshort-term and long-term morbidity. Rheumatology opinion should be\nsought for evaluation of arthritis with unclear diagnosis. 9.2 Orthopaedic Referral\nReferral to the orthopaedic surgeon should be made when the patient\ndoes not experience satisfactory improvement in terms of pain, stability\nor function despite adequate pharmacological and non-pharmacological\ntreatment. The patients should be made to understand the reason for\nreferral. Recommendation 16\n\u2022 Referral of osteoarthritis cases to either rheumatology or orthopaedic\nclinic should provide the following information:-\n\uf099 Diagnosis\n\uf099 Severity and its impact on activity of daily living\n\uf099 Co-morbidities that might require further medical assessment\n\uf099 Relevant investigation results and current medications (Grade C)\n10. PRIMARY PREVENTION\nIdentifying and modifying the risk factors can help in preventing OA and\nits progression. Many of these risk factors are of particular importance\nin weight-bearing joints.

Management of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n33\n11. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nIt is important to standardise the management of OA at all healthcare\nlevels in Malaysia using an evidence-based CPG in order to manage\nOA appropriately. It is therefore crucial for healthcare providers to\nunderstand the disease as it is a common disease which may result in\nsignificant disabilities. 11.1 Facilitating & Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:-\n1. Wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers (hard\nand soft copies)\n2. Regular rheumatology update for healthcare providers\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:-\n1. Poor understanding/limited knowledge of OA\n2. Insufficient resources in the management of OA particularly in\nrehabilitation\n3. Variation in treatment practice and preferences\n11.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:-\n1. Ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare\nproviders via printed and electronic copies. 2. Re-enforce training (with adequate funding) of healthcare\nproviders by regular seminars or workshops to ensure\ninformation is up-to-date\n3. Availability of rehabilitation services and trained manpower in\nOA management including multidisciplinary team at different\nlevels of healthcare\n4. Ensure availability of recommended drugs in primary care\nsetting\n5. Ensure patient empowerment via patient education materials\nManagement of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n34\nTo assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following is proposed as\nclinical audit indicator for quality management:-\n*Those at high risk of GI complications (such as ulceration, bleeding,\nperforation and obstruction) are:-\ni. age more than 65 years old or\nii. on high dose of NSAIDs, aspirin, corticosteroid or anticoagulant or\niii. previous history of upper GI complications\nPercentage of OA\npatients referred\nto rheumatology\nor orthopaedic\nclinic with proper\ndocumentation\nNumber of OA patients referred to\nrheumatology or orthopaedic clinic with proper\ndocumentation within a period of time\nX 100%\nNumber of OA patients referred to\nrheumatology or orthopaedic clinic\nin the same period of time\n=\nPercentage of\npatients with\nsymptomatic\nOA at risk of GI\ncomplications*\nprescribed with\nNSAIDs alone\nX 100%\nNumber of patients with symptomatic OA\nat risk of GI complications\nin the same period of time\n=\nNumber of patients with symptomatic OA\nat risk of GI complications prescribed with\nNSAIDs alone within a period of time\nManagement of Osteoarthritis ( Second Edition)\n35\nREFERENCES\n1.
