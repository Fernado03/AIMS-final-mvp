The Review Committee was actively involved in the\ndevelopment process of these guidelines. The previous edition of the CPG on Management of Periodontal\nAbscess (2004) was used as the basis for the development of these\nguidelines. The recommendations were adapted taking into consideration local\npractices. Several improvements have been introduced in this edition. In addition\nto the general text and photographic updates, new and updated\ninformation has been included in the management such as use of\nantimicrobials, key messages and recommendations. Besides this,\nclinical audit indicators have also been identified for the purpose of\nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes. Evidences were retrieved from publications up to June 2016. Literature\nsearch was carried out using the following electronic databases:\nPUBMED/MEDLINE; Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR);\nISI Web of Science; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and full text\njournal articles via OVID search engine. In addition, the reference\nlists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further\nstudies.", "chunk_order": 1}

In addition, the reference\nlists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further\nstudies. The following free text terms or MeSH terms were used either\nsingly or in combination to retrieve the articles: periodontal abscess,\nacute periodontal abscess, chronic periodontal abscess, multiple\nperiodontal abscess, gingival abscess, pericoronal abscess, perioendo lesions, periodontal probing, aetiology, microbiology, periodontal\npathogens, oral hygiene, smoking, diabetes mellitus, tooth extractions,\nchemotherapeutic, antibiotics, treatment, debridement, photodynamic\ntherapy and supportive periodontal therapy. Only literatures in English\nwere retrieved. Management of Periodontal Abscess\n2016\nThere were 15 clinical questions which were assigned to members\nof the development group. The group members met a total of 11\ntimes throughout the development of these guidelines. All retrieved\nliterature were appraised by at least two members and presented in\nthe form of evidence tables and discussed during group meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were agreed upon\nby both the development group and review committee. This CPG is\nbased on reference to the findings of randomized controlled trials,\ndescriptive studies, clinical experiences, case reports and adapted\naccording to local practices. However, when there was lack of\nevidence, recommendations were based on consensus of group\nmembers. Although ideally patients\u2019 views and preferences need to\nbe considered in the development of CPGs, in this instance, it was not\nfeasible. The levels of evidence of the literature were graded using the modified\nversion from the United States (U.S) / Canadian Preventive Services\nTask Force, while the grading of recommendations was based on the\nmodified version of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\n(SIGN). The draft was reviewed by a team of internal and external reviewers. It\nwas made available on the websites of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia\nand Academy of Medicine, Malaysia for comments and feedbacks. Recommendations were presented to the Technical Advisory\nCommittee for CPGs, and finally to the HTA and CPG Council, Ministry\nof Health, Malaysia for approval.

Periodontal abscess occurs mainly in\nperiodontitis sites with deep pockets although it can develop in nonperiodontitis sites. Microorganisms are the cause for the periodontal abscess. The\ncommon microorganisms involved are: 5-7, Level III\na) Fusobacterium nucleatum\nb) Porphyromonas gingivalis\nc) Tannerella forsythia\nd) Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens\ne) Peptostreptococcus micros\nLower prevalences were observed for:\na) Prevotella melaninogenica\nb) Campylobacter rectus\nc) Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans\nSimilar proportions of facultative and strict anaerobes were found, of\nwhich a higher proportion were gram-positive facultative cocci, closely\nfollowed by gram-negative anaerobic rods. 1,7, Level III\nIn periodontitis\u2013affected sites, the mechanisms that may lead to\nabscess formation include: 2, Level III\na) Exacerbation of a chronic lesion as a consequence of changes\nin the subgingival microbiota composition, with an increase\nin bacterial virulence, or a decrease in host defence. This is\nfurther aggravated by the existence of tortuous pockets,\npresence of furcation involvements and vertical defects, which\nmay result in a reduced capacity to self-drain.", "chunk_order": 6}
