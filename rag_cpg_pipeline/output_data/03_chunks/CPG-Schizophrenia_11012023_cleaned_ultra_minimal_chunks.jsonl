Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2021 and will be reviewed in a\nminimum period of four years (2025) or sooner if new evidence\nbecomes available. When it is due for updating, the Chairperson of\nthe CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty will be informed. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope of\nthe revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed, and the latest\nsystematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed.

REFERRAL\n\u2022 Early referral to psychiatric service should be considered for people\nwith schizophrenia having diagnostic or treatment issues. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS\n\u2022 People with possible schizophrenia should be assessed thoroughly\nby history taking, (self-report and collateral), physical examination,\nmental state examination and relevant investigations (if indicated). \u2022 Schizophrenia should be diagnosed using either Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) or\nInternational Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problem\n10th Revision (ICD-10). TREATMENT\na. Pharmacological intervention\n\u2022 Antipsychotics (APs) should be offered in schizophrenia as it is the\nmainstay of the treatment. \u2022 Treatment adherence should be regularly monitored and maximised\nuntil the termination of treatment is indicated in schizophrenia. \u2022 Long-acting (depot) injectable AP in schizophrenia:\n\uf0a1 should be offered when there is medication adherence issue\n\uf0a1 may be considered based on patient\u2019s preference\n\u2022 APs should be offered to prevent relapse in schizophrenia. \uf0a1 Second-generation APs are the preferred choice. \uf0a1 Standard dose of APs should be considered as maintenance\ntreatment. \u2022 Intermittent treatment using APs should be avoided in schizophrenia. b.", "chunk_order": 2}

A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database\nof Systemic Reviews and others e.g. PubMed and Guidelines\nInternational Network (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans,\n\u201call adults (19 plus years)\u201d, publication from year \u201c2009 to Current\u201d and\nEnglish language. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature\nand guidelines were searched and, experts in the field contacted to\nidentify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 19 Nov\n2018 to 26 Feb 2019. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 30 June 2021 to be included. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from\nthe CPG Secretariat. References were also made to other CPGs on schizophrenia e.g.:\n\u2022 Practice Guideline for The Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia\n(Third Edition) [The American Psychiatric Association (APA),\n2021]\n\u2022 Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Adults [National Institute for\nHealth and Care Excellence (NICE), 2014]\n\u2022 Management of Schizophrenia [Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines\nNetwork (SIGN), 2013]\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as\nreferences. A total of 35 clinical questions (CQ) were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). The DG\nmembers met 33 times throughout the development of these guidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using\nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence\ntables and further discussed at each DG meeting. All statements and\nrecommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the DG and\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\nv\nRC. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were made\nby consensus of the DG and RC. This CPG was developed largely\nbased on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001),\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external\nreviewers.

INTRODUCTION\nSchizophrenia is a term that describes a major psychiatric disorder\nthat alters an individual\u2019s perception, thought, affect and behaviour. Globally, it was ranked as the 11th leading cause of disability in 2013.1\nIn the Second Report of the National Mental Health Registry on\nSchizophrenia in 2003 to 2005, the incidence rate of schizophrenia in\nMalaysia was stated as 5 cases/100,000 population/year. However, the\nexpected rate was 100 cases/100,000 population/year and possible\nreasons for low reported incidence were delayed or under reporting and\nadministrative reasons. The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was\nlong with a mean of 28.7 months and longer among females. The clinical\nimportance of DUP was that it was one of the few prognostic factors\nwhich can be altered through changes in health service delivery.2 This\nemphasises the value of early recognition and the necessity for early\nreferral and intervention including during prodromal period. Although the prevalence of schizophrenia worldwide was low,3 its\nimpact on health, social and economy are tremendous for patients,\nfamilies/caregivers and society. In an economic evaluation in Malaysia,\nbased on a total estimated number of treated cases of 15,104, the total\neconomic burden of treatment for schizophrenia stood at USD100\nmillion which was equivalent to 0.04% of the national gross domestic\nproduct. On average, the mean cost per patient was USD6,594. Of\nthe total economic burden, 72% was attributed to indirect cost (USD72\nmillion), followed by direct medical cost at 26% and the remaining on\ndirect non-medical cost.4 This huge magnitude of this disease burden is\nvital for policymakers to prioritise service for schizophrenia. Worldwide, mental health services have experienced a series of\nparadigm shifts along with the development of medical technologies\nand the human rights movements where the services are delivered in\nthe community.5; 6 The community-based mental health service takes\ninto account the fact that people with schizophrenia face difficulties\nin essential issues e.g. employment, housing, and relationship\nwith families and friends,6; 7 besides stigma and discrimination. Ideally,\nsuch service should include care and treatment delivered close to\nhome.8, level III In Malaysia, efforts on integrating the care for mentally\nill patients in the community have started since 1997 as outlined in\nthe National Mental Health Policy.9; 10 Subsequently, the development\nof community mental health centre (CMHC) begun in 2011.", "chunk_order": 8}

CMHC,\nor Mentari as it is branded in Malaysia, is a centre for treatment and\ncare of mental health that offers screening, diagnosis, treatment\nand rehabilitation of any person suffering from any mental disorder\nin accordance with the Mental Health Act 2001 and Mental Health\nRegulation 2010.11\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\nThe holistic management of schizophrenia encompasses biologicalpsychosocial-spiritual approach to various dysfunction domains\ni.e. positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction,\nmood symptoms and motor symptoms. Since the first edition of\nManagement of Schizophrenia in Adults in 2009, numerous advances\nin the management of mental disorder have developed including\ntreatment targeting those who are difficult to treat or have intolerable\nto medications and non-adherence to treatment. In this edition of CPG,\nmore clinical questions were added to address the advances. New\nissues being addressed are screening, early intervention in psychosis,\nspecial population and social issues. The summary on management\nand pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia are illustrated in Algorithm 1\nand 2. Management of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\n2. EARLY DETECTION AND REFERRAL\n2.1 Risk Factor\nLatest meta-analysis/systematic review showed significant risk factors\nfor schizophrenia were:\na. substance-induced\npsychoses\nassociated\nwith\ncannabis,\nhallucinogens and amphetamines had an increased risk of\ntransition to schizophrenia12, level II-2\nb. increasing paternal age with RR ranging from 1.05 to 1.7913, level II-2\nc. most urban environment compared with most rural environment\n(OR=2.37, 95% CI 2.01 to 2.81)14, level II-2\nd. prenatal exposure to a range of infections and inflammatory\nresponses may be a risk factor e.g. Herpes Simplex (HSV-2)\nwith OR ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 and toxoplasma gondii (OR=1.79,\n95% CI 1.01 to 3.15)15, level II-2\nIn a recent systemic review, there was a risk to develop schizophrenia\nin the offspring of mother with prenatal Toxoplasma gondii infection. Association with HSV-2 infection was likely due to confounding factor. In contrast, maternal influenza infection was a viable risk factor for\nschizophrenia.16, level III However, quality of the included primary papers\nwere not mentioned. Other risk factors would include:\n\u2022 family history of schizophrenia17\n\u2022 history of obstetric complications e.g. pre-eclampsia and extreme\nprematurity17\n\u2022 cannabis use17\n\u2022 history of childhood central nervous system infection17\n\u2022 refugee and migrant status with HR of 2.90 (95% CI 2.31 to 3.64)\nand 1.75 (95% CI 1.51 to 2.02) respectively18, level II-2\n2.2 Screening\nA new 32-item self-rating screening tool (SPro) was developed for prepsychotic states. SCL-90-R-PARA/PSYC was generated based on\n\u201cParanoid Ideation\u201d (PARA) and \u201cPsychoticism\u201d (PSYC) subscales of\nSymptom-Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) to explore psychosis-like\nsymptoms.", "chunk_order": 9}

A study examining predictive validity of SPro against SCL90-R-PARA/PSYC on military men showed an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI\n0.65 to 0.84).19, level III\nIn another study on preliminary validity of the brief version self-report\nProdromal Questionnaire (PQ-B) among adolescents and young adults\nat two prodromal psychosis research clinics showed good validity of\nprodromal psychosis syndromes (AUC=0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.84).20, level III\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\nA two-stage study to screen relatives of people with schizophrenia\nand general individuals for sub-threshold psychosis used Screening\nQuestionnaire (SQ) and General Health Questionnaires-12 (GHQ-12)\nin the initial stage. Those who screened positive were reassessed using\nthe Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State in the second\nstage. Of 29% people initially screened positive by both SQ and GHQ-12,\nonly 4% were positive after final assessment. These indicated that both\nSQ and GHQ-12 were not suitable for screening early psychosis.21, level III\n\u2022 More evidence is warranted before screening tools for pre-psychosis\nin schizophrenia can be recommended. \u2022 Prodromal phase is characterised by impairments in psychosocial\nfunctioning, odd and eccentric behaviour, poor communication\nand motivation, blunted or flattened affect and neglect of personal\nhygiene. \u2022 People with risk factors* in developing schizophrenia and with\nprodromal symptoms may require further assessment to rule out\nschizophrenia; this may be repeated if indicated over time. *refer to Subchapter 2.1\n2.3 Referral\nSince the integration of mental health care into the primary care\nservices in 1996,10 most health facilities in Malaysia are able to provide\nmental health services that focus on mental health promotion and\nprovide early detection and treatment for people with mental disorders. These facilities include the primary care clinics (both in the government\nand private sectors) and the district hospitals. The integration program\nunderlines the importance of both the primary and tertiary centres\nworking together to create a seamless pathway for people with mental\nillness in receiving care. \u2022 For people with schizophrenia treated in primary care, early\nreferral to psychiatric service should be considered in the following\ncircumstances:17; 22\n\uf0a1 presence of prodromal or attenuated symptoms\n\uf0a1 unclear diagnosis\n\uf0a1 plan for psychosocial rehabilitation\n\uf0a1 treatment adherence issues\n\uf0a1 poor response to treatment\n\uf0a1 potential violent behaviour to self or others\n\uf0a1 intolerable side effects from medication\n\uf0a1 co-morbid substance use disorder\n\uf0a1 special group e.g.", "chunk_order": 10}

ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS\n3.1 Bio-Psychosocial Assessment\nBio-psychosocial assessment is essential in the diagnosis of\nschizophrenia. Established tools e.g. Mini International Neuropsychiatric\nInterview (MINI) and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders\n(SCID) are used for diagnosis, while Brief Psychiatric Rating Scales\n(BPRS) and Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale for Schizophrenia\n(PANSS) are performed for severity assessment. It can be used in both\nprimary and secondary/tertiary care. In two cross-sectional studies, Structured Clinical Interview for\nDSM-5 Disorders-Clinician Version (SCID-5-CV) showed \u03ba value\nof >0.8 for diagnosis of schizophrenia with sensitivity and specificity\n>0.70.23 - 24, level III\nNew evidence on assessments for people with schizophrenia are\ndiscussed below:\n\u2022 A small cross-sectional study showed Self-evaluation of Negative\nSymptoms had excellent psychometric properties in measuring the\nsymptoms (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of 0.867 at baseline and 0.897 at 4 - 8\nweeks).25, level III\n\u2022 The 4-item Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-4) on speech\nquantity, emotion, social drive and interest was effective in rapidly\nassessing negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. It\nwas not affected by geographic regions of practice, professional\ncredentialing or their familiarity with the use of schizophrenia\nsymptom rating instruments.26, level III\n\u2022 A small validation study demonstrated that Personal and Social\nPerformance (PSP) scale was significantly correlated with other\nsimilar functioning measures such as PANSS, Global Assessment\nof Functioning (GAF), Quality of Life Scale (QLS) and Clinical\nGlobal Impression Scale (CGI-S) with r of -0.31, 0.35, 0.37 and\n-0.27 respectively for construct validity at baseline.", "chunk_order": 11}

A stronger\ncorrelation between PSP and CGI-S at follow-up was noted with\nr= -0.60 in test-retest reliability.27, level III In another study on those with\nacute symptoms, PSP had good interclass reliability of 0.87. The\ncorrelations between baseline severity based on PANSS and CGI-S\nwith PSP were also significant.28, level I\n\u2022 Among neurocognitive assessments, the Brief Cognitive Assessment\nTool for Schizophrenia (B-CATS) had an administration time\nof approximately 10 minutes. It correlated significantly (r=0.76)\nwith widely used neurocognitive battery i.e. the Measurement\nand Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia\n(MATRICS).29, level III\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\n\u2022 In a large multicentre validation study in people with schizophrenia,\nBrief Negative Symptom Scale showed excellent internal consistency\n(Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1=0.94), strong correlation with the PANSS negative\nsubscale score (\u03c1=0.76) but weak correlations with the PANSS\npositive subscale (\u03c1=0.21) and Calgary Depression Rating Scale for\nschizophrenia (CDSS) total score (\u03c1=0.27).30, level III\nBesides the above assessments, the self-administered WHO Disability\nAssessment Schedule II (WHODAS 2.0) has been used for assessing\nhealth status and disability in people with schizophrenia and mentally\nill patients.31, level III\nAssessment of people with possible schizophrenia consists of\nthorough history taking (collaborative history from patient/family/\ncaregiver), physical examination, mental state examination (MSE) and\ninvestigations where indicated.

Since the\ndiscovery of chlorpromazine in 1952, APs remain the cornerstone of\nschizophrenia treatment in both acute as well as maintenance phases. They generally can be classified as first-generation APs (FGA) and\nsecond-generation APs (SGA). The FGAs derive their effect on positive\nsymptoms by predominantly blocking the dopamine 2 (D2) receptors,\nwhich often results in debilitating extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). The SGAs are however more versatile and act by blocking other\nsubtype dopamine receptors (e.g. clozapine blocks D1 and D4) as well\nas serotonergic, adrenergic and histaminergic receptors. SGAs tend to\ncause more metabolic issues. Although there may be meaningful distinctions in clinical response and\ntolerability of different APs in an individual patient, there is no definitive\nevidence that one AP is superior to another, with the possible exception\nof clozapine.

Doses were classified as:56, level I\n\u2022 standard dose (above or equal to the lower limit of the\nrecommended target dose range for acute treatment)\n\u2022 low dose (50 - 99% of the lower limit)\n\u2022 very low dose (<50% of the lower limit)\nCompared with standard dose:\n\u2022 low dose increased risk of relapse by 44% (RR=1.44, 95% CI 1.10\nto 1.87) and all-cause discontinuation by 12% (RR=1.12, 95% CI\n1.03 to 1.22)\n\u2022 very low dose increased risk of relapse by 72% (RR=1.72, 95%\nCI 1.29 to 2.29) and all-cause discontinuation by 31% (RR=1.31,\n95% CI 1.11 to 1.54)\nIn terms of safety, there were no significant differences between\ndifferent doses in intolerability -related discontinuations, anticholinergic\nuse and rating scale-based assessments of akathisia, dyskinesia and\nparkinsonism. Most primary studies in the meta-analysis were classified\nas having some concerns in risk of bias assessment. Recommendation 5\n\u2022 Antipsychotics (APs) should be offered to prevent relapse in\nschizophrenia. \uf0a1 Second-generation APs are the preferred choice. \uf0a1 Standard dose of APs should be considered as maintenance\ntreatment. 4.1.5\nIntermittent treatment in relapse prevention\nIn a Cochrane systematic review on people with schizophrenia,\nintermittent AP treatment compared with maintenance treatment at \u226526\nweeks follow-up showed:57, level I\n\u2022 higher relapse (RR=2.46, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.54)\n\u2022 higher hospitalisation rate (RR=1.65, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.06)\n\u2022 no difference in tardive dyskinesia (RR=1.15, 95% CI 0.58 to\n2.30)\nThe quality of evidence in the first two outcomes was moderate while\nthe last outcome low. In a later meta-analysis of ten studies, stabilised people with\nschizophrenia who had been exposed for at least six months to\nintermittent or placebo strategies had higher risk of relapse compared\nwith those on continuous treatment with OR of (3.36, 95% CI 2.36 to\n5.45) and 5.64 (95% CI 4.47 to 7.11) respectively.58, level I\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\nRecommendation 6\n\u2022 Intermittent treatment using antipsychotics should be avoided in\nschizophrenia. 4.1.6\nTreatment for extrapyramidal signs, sedation and weight\ngain associated with antipsychotics\nThere are several common adverse effects of APs e.g. sedation, EPS,\nweight gain, constipation, cardiovascular complications and metabolic\nsyndrome.

The aim of these\npsychosocial intervention varies depending on the treatment goal. The\ncommonly used interventions are discussed below. 4.3.1\nPsychoeducation\nPsychoeducation improves understanding of mental health issues,\nrecognising early warning signs of relapse and understanding on\nthe work of psychiatric services.22 A psychoeducation programme\nincludes key information about diagnosis, symptoms, psychosocial\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\ninterventions, medications and side effects as well as information about\nstress and coping, crisis plans, early warning signs (EWS) and, suicide\nand relapse prevention.36\nIn a Cochrane systematic review of low-quality evidence on people with\nschizophrenia, brief psychoeducation either individual, group or family,\nwas better than routine care in prevention of:62, level I\n\u2022 non-compliance with medication at short-term (RR=0.63, 95% CI\n0.41 to 0.96) and medium-term (RR=0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.54)\n\u2022 relapse at medium-term (RR=0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93)\nAnother Cochrane systematic review on promoting well-being\nand reducing distress of siblings of people with schizophrenia,\npsychoeducation was better than standard care in coping with (family)\nburden at 12 months (MD= -8.80, 95% CI -15.22 to -2.34).63, level I\nIn an RCT looking on community-based comprehensive intervention\nwhich included psychoeducation, social skills training, cognitive\nbehaviour therapy (CBT) and, strategies against stigma and\ndiscrimination (SASD) vs control for people with schizophrenia, the\nintervention was significantly effective at nine months on the following\noutcomes:64, level I\n\u2022 overcoming stigma\n\u2022 anticipated discrimination\n\u2022 functioning based on GAF total score\n\u2022 reduction in BPRS total score\n\u2022 reduction in PANSS negative score\nEWS are early symptoms that are distinctive to the person with\nschizophrenia and often precede acute psychotic relapse. Examples\nare change in sleep pattern, irritability, social withdrawal, difficulty in\nconcentration and decline in self-care. Thus, intervention on EWS aims\nto detect and manage these signs for prevention of relapse. A Cochrane\nsystematic review showed that training to recognise EWS of relapse in\nschizophrenia was better compared with treatment as usual in:65, level I\n\u2022 preventing relapses (RR=0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79)\n\u2022 preventing re-hospitalisation (RR=0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66)\n\u2022 improving medication compliance (MD=0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77)\nIn subgroup analysis, time taken to relapse after treatment was\nlonger if EWS intervention was delivered to patients only compared\nwith treatment as usual (HR=0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53), but no\ndifference was shown when EWS intervention was delivered to both\npatient and their carer/health professionals.", "chunk_order": 26}

Apart from that, time to rehospitalisation after treatment was longer (HR=0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to\n0.83) when the intervention was delivered to both patients and their\ncarer/health professional. In this review, the overall quality of the 34\nRCTs was very low. Management of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\nSIGN recommends that psychoeducation should not be offered as a\nstand-alone intervention to people with schizophrenia and professionals\nshould ensure that people with schizophrenia and their families/carers\nare informed about the illness.49 APA recommends that people with\nschizophrenia receive psychoeducation.36\nIn Malaysia, family psychoeducation programmes have been conducted\nfor many years based on the Family Link programme module.66\nRecommendation 8\n\u2022 Psychoeducation which includes early warning signs interventions\nshould be given in addition to other interventions in schizophrenia. 4.3.2\nSupported employment\nIn a Cochrane systematic review for adults with severe mental illness\nwhere schizophrenia disorders were well represented, supported\nemployment increased levels of any employment compared with other\nvocational approaches (RR=3.24, 95% CI 2.17 to 4.82). It also showed\nsome advantages in other secondary outcomes e.g. duration of any\nform of paid employment, job tenure for competitive employment and\ntime to first competitive employment in long-term. However the primary\npapers were of very low quality.67, level I\nNICE recommends to offer supported employment programmes to\npeople with psychosis or schizophrenia who wish to find or return to\nwork. Apart from that, it is recommended to consider other occupational\nor educational activities, including pre-vocational training, for people\nwho are unable to work or unsuccessful in finding employment.22\nAPA also recommends that patients with schizophrenia receive\nsupported employment services.36 Guidelines on implementation of\nsupported employment programme for people with mental illness\nincluding schizophrenia has also been developed locally.17\nRecommendation 9\n\u2022 Supported employment should be offered in schizophrenia. 4.3.3\nCognitive remediation therapy\nCognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia that is fully\nevident at the time of first episode and the most affected areas are\nattention, verbal memory and executive functioning.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of schizophrenia should be guided by an evidencebased approach, in order to provide quality care to the people with\nschizophrenia. Several factors may affect the implementation of\nrecommendations in the CPG\n8.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\n\u2022 wide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to\nhealthcare providers\n\u2022 training and updates in relation to schizophrenia to healthcare\nproviders\n\u2022 accessibility to relevant multidisciplinary teams\n\u2022 public awareness campaigns related to mental health and mental\ndisorders including schizophrenia\n\u2022 inter-ministerial\ncollaboration\nand\ninvolvement\nof\nnongovernmental organisations to support the people with\nschizophrenia and their caregivers\nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG\nare:\n\u2022 limited exposure and training among healthcare providers on\nmanagement of schizophrenia\n\u2022 variation in availability of expertise and access to service provision\n\u2022 insufficient resources in terms of budget, expertise, medications,\npsychosocial intervention\n\u2022 socio-cultural barriers and stigma and lack of awareness among\npatients, families, community and healthcare providers\n\u2022 lack of local data on schizophrenia, e.g. research, registry, etc.,\nfor planning on services\n8.2 Potential Resource Implications\nThis CPG recommends early detection and referral, comprehensive\nassessment and treatment of schizophrenia. These require increased\nawareness among healthcare providers, the public and other\nstakeholders to establish early diagnosis and uninterrupted various\nforms of treatment as well as support to the patients and their caregivers. Patient-centred care and shared decision making are key elements in\nsuccessful management in schizophrenia. However, treatment non-adherence is a widely recognised problem\nin schizophrenia. This includes failure to start treatment programmes,\nManagement of Schizophrenia (Second Edition)\ndefault in outpatient clinic appointments and failure to medicate with\nprescribed APs. The outcome of this discouraging situation is increase\nin relapse of psychotic symptoms, hospitalisation, aggression, poor\nQoL, stigmatisation and premature death. Accordingly, a Key Performance Index for psychiatric service i.e. outpatient defaulter rate is being monitored in both primary and\nsecondary/tertiary care under MoH. By doing so, effective psychosocial\ninterventions e.g. psychoeducation can be targeted to people with\nschizophrenia. This CPG also recommends that depot APs be prescribed\nto patients with a history of non-adherence in order to improve their\noutcomes. Simultaneously, data on depot prescriptions can be captured\neasily along with the KPI of defaulted patients as a surrogate maker of\nCPG utilisation based on the recommendation of depot. Moreover, the\nslightly expensive SGA depots with few intolerance issues and longer\ninjection intervals should be used more widely in the country.

The individual experiences two or more of the following for a\nsignificant portion of time during a 1-month period. And at least one\nof these must be (1), (2), or (3):\n1. Delusions\n2. Hallucinations\n3. Disorganized speech (incoherence or derailment)\n4. Completely disorganized or catatonic behavior\n5. Negative symptoms, such as diminished emotional expression\nB. For a significant amount of time since the disturbance began, level\nof functioning in one or more major areas (e.g., work, interpersonal\nrelations, or self-care) is clearly below the level achieved prior to\nonset. \u2022 In children or adolescents, there is a failure to achieve the expected\nlevel of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning. C. Signs of the disturbance continue for 6 months or longer. This period\nmust include at least 1 full month of symptoms that meet the first\ncriteria and may include periods of residual symptoms. During these\nresidual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested\nonly by negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms outlined in\nthe first criteria, only in a lesser form. D. The disturbance cannot be better explained by schizoaffective\ndisorder, depressive or bipolar disorder because either:\n\u2022 No major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently\nwith the active-phase symptoms or if mood episodes have occurred\nduring active phase symptoms, it\u2019s been for a minor amount of time. E. The disturbance cannot be attributed to the physiological effects of a\nsubstance (e.g., a drug of abuse or medication) or another medical\ncondition. F.", "chunk_order": 58}

Hallucinatory voices giving a running commentary on the\npatient's behaviour, or discussing him between themselves,\nor other types of hallucinatory voices coming from some part\nof the body. d. Persistent delusions of other kinds that are culturally\ninappropriate and completely impossible (e.g. being able to\ncontrol the weather or being in communication with aliens\nfrom another world). 2. or at least two of the following:\ne.
