However, variations in\nthe management of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis still exist\namongst ophthalmologists in Malaysia. This national guideline has been\ncompiled by a committee comprising of ophthalmologists, a pharmacist\nand a nursing officer from the public and private sector. It aims to present\nevidence-based recommendations as a guide for the prophylaxis and\nmanagement of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis. Relevant key words \u2018post-operative endophthalmitis\u2019, \u2018endophthalmitis\u2019,\n\u2018endophthalmitis AND causative organism\u2019, \u2018endophthalmitis AND\nprophylaxis\u2019, \u2018endophthalmitis AND infection control\u2019, \u2018endophthalmitis AND\nclinical features\u2019, \u2018endophthalmitis AND management\u2019 were used to generate\nliterature from the following databases (PubMed), Cochrane Database of\nSystematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews and\nCochrane Controlled Trial Register via OVID search engine. Searches\nwere also manually done in non-indexed journals and \u201cgrey literature\u201d. Existing guideline, mainly the ESCRS Guidelines on prevention,\ninvestigation and management of post-operative endophthalmitis was\nincluded as reference. The experience and knowledge of the CPG\ndevelopment group was also considered when formulating the guideline. Assessment of the evidence was conducted independently by individual\nmembers and discussed as a group before decisions were made. In each\narea considered, the best evidence available was given more weightage. Less well designed studies were either merely mentioned or excluded unless\nthey added a different perspective. Related articles were selected and out\nof these, relevant articles were chosen and graded using the modified\nversion of the Catalonian Agency for Health Technology Assessment and\nResearch (CAHTAR) model. The grading of recommendations was modified\nfrom the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN).

INTRODUCTION\nPost-operative infectious endophthalmitis is an infrequent but\ndevastating complication of ophthalmic surgery. Its occurrence can\nlead to poor visual prognosis, and increase in health care cost. The\nrate of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis therefore is frequently\nused as an indicator for quality assurance of ophthalmology services. It is currently used as one of the national indicator approaches (NIA)\nin the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). 1.1 Definition\nFor practical purposes, post-operative infectious endophthalmitis\nis defined as intraocular inflammation caused by an infective\nprocess following intraocular surgery. Intra-ocular surgery is\ndefined as any ocular surgery where the full thickness of the\ncornea and / or sclera has been breached. This definition\nexcludes patients with penetrating eye injury. Acute infectious endophthalmitis usually presents within two\nweeks of surgery, whereas chronic infectious endophthalmitis\nusually present a few weeks or months following surgery. 1.2 Magnitude of Problem\nOver the past decades, the incidence of post-operative infectious\nendophthalmitis has shown a decline due to improvements in\nsurgical techniques and instrumentation. Emphasis on sterility\nand prophylactic measures may also have a role in this decline. The incidence of post-operative endophthalmitis ranges from\n0.07% (1, Level 8; 2, Level 8) to 1.8% (3, Level 8). Incidence rates differ with\nthe type of surgery.", "chunk_order": 2}

Emphasis on sterility\nand prophylactic measures may also have a role in this decline. The incidence of post-operative endophthalmitis ranges from\n0.07% (1, Level 8; 2, Level 8) to 1.8% (3, Level 8). Incidence rates differ with\nthe type of surgery. Cataract surgery, being the most commonly\nperformed ocular surgery, is the most common type of surgery\npreceding endophthalmitis, with incidences ranging from 0.07%\nto 0.13% (4, Level 8). The incidence following specific type of surgery\nwas : secondary intraocular lens (IOL) 0.30% to 0.40 %, extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with or without IOL\nimplantation 0.072% to 0.18%, phacoemulsification 0.015% to\n0.5%, penetrating keratoplasty 0.11 % to 0.18%, glaucoma\nfiltering surgery 0.06% to 1.8%, pars plana vitrectomy 0.046% to\n0.07%, combined trabeculectomy and cataract surgery 0.11%,\ncombined penetrating keratoplasty and cataract surgery 0.19%\n(4, Level 9, 5 Level 8 ). In Malaysia, the rates of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis\nfollowing all intraocular surgery in MOH hospitals ranged from\n0% to 1.13%, with a mean of 0.26 % for 2 consecutive years\n(2003 and 2004) and a mean of 0.18% for the year 2005\n(Unpublished data, Annual MOH census). The rate following cataract surgery based on the National Cataract\nSurgery Registry of MOH hospitals was 0.19% in 2002, 0.24% in\n2003 and 0.16% in 2004 (6, Level 9 ; 7, Level 9; 8, Level 9 ). 1.3 Causative Organism\nThe microbial spectrum seen in post-operative endophthalmitis\ndepends on various factors including environmental, geographic\nclimatic conditions as well as types of surgery.

PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES\nThe low incidence of post-operative infectious endophthalmitis makes\nit difficult to assess accurately the efficacy of preventive measures. Many studies either have low statistical power in assessing the\ninfluence of a change in procedure on the incidence of post-operative\nendophthalmitis, or measure surrogate outcomes such as change in\nconjunctival flora or aqueous bacterial counts. In addition, most of\nthe studies on prophylaxis were related to cataract surgery and thus\nits application to other forms of ocular surgeries may not apply. As the ocular surface is a common source of pathogens (10, Level 2; 11, Level 8)\nvarious measures have been used to prepare the ocular surface\nbefore surgery to reduce normal ocular surface flora. 2.1 Antiseptic Measures\na. Preoperative povidone iodine on skin and conjunctival sac\nPovidone iodine 5% solution has been shown to decrease the\nnumber of colonies isolated from the conjunctiva by 91% and\ndecrease the number of species by 50%. (9, Level I; 31, Level 3; 32, Level 7; 33,\nLevel 7; 34, Level 7; 35, Level 4; 36, Level 8; 37, Level 8). Instillation of topical 5%\npovidone iodine solution into the conjunctival sac just before\nsurgery significantly reduced the incidence of culture positive\nendophthalmitis as compared to silver nitrate solution (38, Level 4; 9,\nLevel I). Even when used at 1.25% preoperatively, topical povidone\niodine has shown a significant reduction in the conjunctival\nbacterial counts (39, Level 4). Its application to the eye at the end of surgery has also been\nshown to be effective in reducing conjunctival bacterial flora and\nwas in fact more effective when compared to topical broad\nspectrum antibiotics (40, Level 7). However, on the basis of available clinical studies, only povidone\niodine in a concentration of 5% in balanced salt solution (BSS)\nor isotonic saline can be recommended as the preoperative\nantiseptic of choice (26, Level 9). Chlorhexidine 0.05% should be used as\nthe alternative in patients who are allergic to povidone iodine (26, Level 9). The use of povidone iodine was not associated with significant\nadverse reactions (38, Level 4). b. Draping of periorbital area\nInadequate draping of the periorbital areas with exposed lids and\nlashes to the surgical site might be a possible risk factor (14, Level 9). c. Trimming of eyelash\nPreoperative trimming of eyelashes is not associated with a\nreduction of risk of post-operative endophthalmitis (22, Level 8; 9, Level 1). d.", "chunk_order": 5}

Trimming of eyelash\nPreoperative trimming of eyelashes is not associated with a\nreduction of risk of post-operative endophthalmitis (22, Level 8; 9, Level 1). d. Preoperative irrigation of lacrimal passages\nPreoperative irrigation of the lacrimal passages has no significant\neffect as prophylactic measure (9, Level 1). e. Preoperative saline irrigation of conjunctival sac\nSaline irrigation of conjunctival sac did not reduce the bacterial\nflora (9, Level 1; 34, Level 4). 2.2 Antibiotics Prophylaxis\na. Intracameral antibiotic\ni. Intracameral injection of cefuroxime at the end of surgery\nIntracameral injection of 1mg cefuroxime in 0.1 ml at the end of\nphacoemulsification surgery has been shown to significantly\nreduce the risk of post-operative endophthalmitis up to five folds\nin a multicenter European study (41, Level 2). This prophylactic\nmeasure has been adopted by all Swedish cataract surgeons (42,\nLevel 7). Refer Appendix 4 for the dilution of intracameral cefuroxime. Careful dilution should be undertaken to ensure its safe use and\nto prevent potential toxicity. ii. Intracameral irrigation of antibiotic through addition of\nvancomycin into irrigating solution\nAnterior chamber contamination at the end of cataract surgery\nvaries from 0.18% to 13.7% (26, Level 9; 43, Level 8). Although some\nstudies evaluating intraocular fluid contamination have shown\nthat irrigating solution with vancomycin have reduced positive\naqueous cultures (44, Level 9; 45, Level 8; 46, Level 2), whether the reduction is\nmeaningful remains doubtful (26, Level 9). Furthermore, it has been\nshown that exposure to an antibiotic for a short duration during\nintraocular surgery has little effect on organisms commonly\nresponsible for endophthalmitis (47, Level 9). As its use can cause\nretinal toxicity from inadvertent dilution error including irreversible\nmacular infarct, as well as resulting in antibiotic resistance, it is\ngenerally not recommended (48, Level 9; 49, Level 9; 50, Level 9). b. Preoperative topical antibiotic\nThere is insufficient evidence to show that the use of preoperative\ntopical antibiotic significantly reduces the risk of post-operative\ninfectious endophthalmitis (9, Level 1; 41, Level 2). c. Preoperative systemic antibiotic\nIntravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is not proven to be of benefit\nin preventing post-operative endophthalmitis (26, Level 9). d. Post-operative subconjunctival antibiotic injection\nSub-conjunctival antibiotic injection at the conclusion of surgery\ndoes not appear to prevent post-operative endophthalmitis (22, Level 9). 2.3 Heparinized Intraocular Infusion Solution and Heparin\nCoated IOL\nHeparin coats the lens and intraocular surface and thus prevent\nbacterial adherence (51, Level 9). However there is no sufficient\nevidence to indicate benefits of both heparinized irrigating solution\nand heparin coated IOL in preventing post-operative infectious\nendophthalmitis (52, Level 3). 2.4 Operating Theatre\na.", "chunk_order": 6}

However there is no sufficient\nevidence to indicate benefits of both heparinized irrigating solution\nand heparin coated IOL in preventing post-operative infectious\nendophthalmitis (52, Level 3). 2.4 Operating Theatre\na. Air flow design\nThere are no current guidelines for the type of airflow best required\nto prevent post-operative infectious endophthalmitis for\nintraocular surgery. The ideal type of airflow system is being\ninvestigated by the ESCRS multi-centre study on endophthalmitis\nafter phacoemulsification surgery (26, Level 9).. b. Equipment sterilization\nAll equipment for surgery should be sterile. Care is required with\nboth washing and autoclaving the instruments. It is preferable\nthat tubing that becomes wet within the operative procedure\nshould not be reused. Bottles of balanced salt solution (BSS)\nshould never be kept overnight or used for more than one\noperating session. Operating theatre trolleys must be kept dry\nas wet areas are easily contaminated with Pseudomonas\naeruginosa (26, Level 9). Further details of prophylactic measures are given in Appendix 1. Recommendations for prophylaxis\nUse of povidone iodine 5% as an antiseptic agent for preparation of\nskin and conjunctival sac preoperatively is recommended. (Grade A)\nProper draping of the eyelid margin using an adhesive non porous drape\nand the use of speculum to cover all the eyelashes is recommended. (Grade C)\nIntracameral injection of 1 mg cefuroxime in 0.1ml at the end of surgery\nis recommended. Careful dilution should be undertaken to prevent\npotential toxicity. (Grade A)\n3. DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATIONS\nPatients who have undergone intraocular surgery and who develop\nthe following clinical features should be assessed and monitored\nclosely. Prompt management with intravitreal tap and intravitreal\nantibiotic injection should be performed in clinically suspected cases\nof post-operative infectious endophthalmitis. 3.1 Clinical Features\na.", "chunk_order": 7}

DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATIONS\nPatients who have undergone intraocular surgery and who develop\nthe following clinical features should be assessed and monitored\nclosely. Prompt management with intravitreal tap and intravitreal\nantibiotic injection should be performed in clinically suspected cases\nof post-operative infectious endophthalmitis. 3.1 Clinical Features\na. Acute post-operative endophthalmitis\nThe symptoms and signs may include the following:\n-\nOcular pain (74-85%) (53, Level 2; 16, Level 7; 26, Level 9; 50, Level 9)\n-\nReduced vision (>90%) (53, Level 2; 16, Level 7 ; 50, Level 9; 26, Level 9)\n-\nSwollen lids (35%) (54, Level 8; 50, Level 9)\n-\nInflamed or oedematous conjunctiva (>80%) (54, Level 8; 50, Level 9;\n26, Level 9)\n-\nDischarge into conjunctiva (26, Level 9; 50, Level 9)\n-\nCorneal oedema (26, Level 9, 50, Level 9)\n-\nCloudy anterior chamber with cells, hypopyon or fibrin (7585%) (54, Level 8; 26 , Level 9; 50, Level 9)\n-\nVitreous clouding (vitritis) (26, Level 9; 50, Level 9 )\n-\nInvolvement of posterior segment with retinitis, and/or retinal\nperiphlebitis, retinal oedema and papillary oedema (26, Level 9; 50, Level 9)\nInvolvement of posterior segment is virtually always accompanied\nby severe anterior segment inflammation. b. Chronic post-operative infectious endophthalmitis\nPatients may present with any of the symptoms and signs of\nacute post-operative endophthalmitis. Features include:\n-\nCorneal oedema (55, Level 8)\n-\nMutton fat keratic precipitates on IOL or corneal endothelium\n(4, Level 9)\n-\nPersistent low grade uveitis that may respond to\ncorticosteroids initially ( typical) (4, Level 9)\n-\nHypopyon \u2013 sometimes so small that it can only be visible\nwith gonioscopy, or recurrent hypopyon that fails to respond\nto corticosteroid (4, Level 9; 26,level 9)\n-\nWhite \u2018string-of-pearl\u2019 infiltrate in the anterior chamber and\nvitreous are sometimes seen in fungal infections (4, Level 9)\n-\nPlaque located on the posterior capsule, IOL or retained\nlens particles (40-89%) (56, Level 9; 57, Level 9; 4, Level 9)\n-\nVitreous clouding (vitritis) from chronic inflammation (4, Level\n9; 26, Level 9)\n3.2 Investigations\nWhen a clinical diagnosis of acute or chronic post-operative\ninfectious endophthalmitis is made, a vitreous tap should be\nperformed within ONE hour after clinical diagnosis, together\nwith administration of an intravitreal antibiotic injection (26, Level 9). Anterior chamber tap is helpful in the identification of the causative\norganism as some organisms grow from the aqueous but not\nfrom the vitreous sample. Aqueous and vitreous specimens should be sent for gram stain,\nculture and sensitivity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods\noffer much improved pathogen detection especially in the case\nof chronic endophthalmitis with low pathogen counts (58, Level 8)\n. However, due to its high sensitivity, problems with availability and\nthe risk of contamination, its use as routine diagnostic test is\nlimited (26, Level 9).", "chunk_order": 8}

Vitreous biopsy has not been shown to have better microbial\nyield as compared to vitreous tap (59, Level 2). Conjunctival and corneal swabs are usually not helpful in isolating\nthe causative microorganisms (38, Level 4). Refer Appendix 2 for the performance of anterior chamber tap,\nvitreous tap and intravitreal antibiotic injection. 4. TREATMENT\nThere is variation in the treatment of post-operative infectious\nendophthalmitis and the treatment approach is usually based on\ninstitutional protocol. 4.1 Treatment\nof\nAcute\nPost-operative\nInfectious\nEndophthalmitis\na. Antimicrobial therapy\ni. Intravitreal antibiotics\nIntravitreal antibiotics should be given as soon as possible after\nclinical diagnosis has been made (4, Level 9; 26, Level 9; 50, Level 9). This\nshould be preceded by intravitreal tap. Intravitreal antibiotic may\nbe repeated as necessary judging by the clinical response, usually\nat an interval of 48-72 hours (50, Level 9). The time interval for repeat\nintravitreal antibiotic depends on the half-life of the antibiotic used. A combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics covering both gram\npositive and negative organism is used. The choice of antibiotics\nshould be reviewed following the culture and sensitivity results. The commonly used antibiotic combinations are:\n-\nVancomycin (2mg in 0.1ml) AND Ceftazidime (2mg in 0.1ml)\n(60, Level 2; 4, Level 8; 61, Level 9) OR\n-\nVancomycin (2mg in 0.1ml) AND Amikacin (0.4mg in 0.1ml)\n(4, Level 8; 53, Level 2)\nCeftazidime is preferred over amikacin in view of amikacin related\nretinal toxicity (53, level 2; 62, level 9; 48, Level 9; 4, Level 9). Patient\u2019s clinical progress should be observed and monitored\nclosely. Early referral for a vitreoretinal opinion after intravitreal\nantibiotic injection is recommended. Refer Appendix 3 for the preparation of intravitreal drugs using\naseptic technique. ii. Topical and subconjunctival injection of antibiotic\nThe aim of topical and subconjunctival injection of broad spectrum\nantibiotics use is to treate possible ocular surface and anterior\nsegment infection. Topical ceftazidime (5% or 50mg/ml), topical\nvancomycin (5% or 50mg/ml) or other broad spectrum antibiotics\neye drops are used, either as monotherapy or combined therapy,\nhourly round the clock initially with subsequent tapering according\nto clinical response (50, Level 9). Subconjunctival injection of antibiotic\ncan be used together with intravitreal antibiotics in the treatment\nof post-operative endophthalmitis. This is done in the hope of\nachieving higher concentration of antibiotics around the eye and\nin the anterior chamber, especially when the frequent round the\nclock instillation of topical antibiotics at the initial period is not\npossible (4, Level 9).", "chunk_order": 9}

When giving subconjunctival antibiotic,\nsubconjunctival mydricane can be given to get pupillary dilatation\nwhich helps the movement of antibiotic around the eye. iii. Systemic antimicrobial therapy\nThe Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study concluded that systemic\nceftazidime and amikacin did not have any effect on the course\nand outcome of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery (53, Level 2). In cases of severe, virulent endophthalmitis, systemic intravenous\nantibiotics of the same choice as intravitreal antibiotics should\nbe given (4, Level 9). Alternatively, oral moxifloxacin (400mg daily for\n10 days) or oral ciprofloxacin (750mg bd for 14 days) can be\ngiven. However, systemic fluoroquinolones are to be used with\ncaution in children (50, Level 9). Oral clarithromycin (500mg bd for 2 weeks) is recommended for\npatients with acute post-operative endophthalmitis with a culture\nnegative eye (66, Level 8; 67, Level 8). It acts as a biofilm reducing agent to\nenhance the efficacy of cefuroxime, ceftazidime and amikacin. In view of a high incidence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, fourth\ngeneration fluoroquinolones, oral moxifloxacin (400mg daily for\n10 days) has been used (65, Level 9). In addition, moxifloxacin has\nan anti-biofilm effect on coagulase- negative staphylococci, which\nare one of the commonest infecting organisms following cataract\nsurgery. Besides, moxifloxacin has also been shown to have\nbetter penetration to inflamed ocular tissue (68, Level 9; 69, 2006, Level 8). This may therefore improve the ocular prognosis. When oral\nmoxifloxacin is used, the use of oral clarithromycin is not indicated\n(65, Level 9). b. Anti-inflammatory therapy\nThere is limited evidence on the efficacy of intravitreal and\nperiocular corticosteroids in the treatment of post-operative\ninfectious endophthalmitis. While intravitreal dexamethasone\nreduces early inflammation in bacterial endophthalmitis, it has\nno independent influence on the visual outcome (63, Level 8; 64, Level 8). Intensive topical prednisolone acetate 1% or dexamethasone 1%\nevery 1 to 2 hours is recommended to control anterior chamber\ninflammation. Its use should begin soon after intravitreal injection\nof antibiotics (65, Level 9). Oral prednisolone one day after intra-vitreal antibiotic therapy\nhas not been shown to have any negative effect on the course of\ninfection in bacterial endophthalmitis (53, Level 2). It may be used in\nthose who have no contraindications for corticosteroid (50, Level 9; 65,\nLevel 9). The dosage of oral prednisolone is 1 mg/kg/day, to be\ntapered by 10mg each week for a total duration of up to 3 weeks\n(65, Level 9).", "chunk_order": 10}

The dosage of oral prednisolone is 1 mg/kg/day, to be\ntapered by 10mg each week for a total duration of up to 3 weeks\n(65, Level 9). Tablet ranitidine is prescribed simultaneously for gastric\nprotection. Patients with fungal endophthalmitis should not be\ngiven prednisolone. c. Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA)\nTPA has only been reported to be useful as adjunctive therapy in\nanimal studies and in a small case series of endophthalmitis with\nsevere fibrinous anterior chamber reaction (70, Level 9; 71, Level 9; 72, Level 9). There is insufficient evidence for its routine use for both acute\nand chronic post-operative endophthalmitis. However,\nintracameral injection of 25 mg in 0.1 ml is recommended in\npatients with severe fibrinous anterior chamber reactions\nparticularly in eyes with pupils that do not dilate with mydriatics. d. Vitrectomy\nAccording to Endopthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS), routine\nimmediate vitrectomy is not necessary in patients with better than\nlight perception vision at presentation but is of substantial benefit\nfor those who have light perception- only vision (53, level 2; 73, Level 9). However, limitations of EVS leave this conclusion open to future\nmodification (26, Level 9; 74, Level 9). Refer algorithm for the management of acute post-operative endophthalmitis\n13\nRecommendation for treatment of acute post-operative\nendophthalmitis\nIntravitreal antibiotic should be given within 1 hour of diagnosis and\nrepeated when necessary. (Grade C)\nIntensive topical antibiotic and steroid should be given round the clock\ninitially. (Grade C)\nSubconjunctival antibiotic is given when indicated. (Grade C)\nThe use of oral or intravenous antibiotics is recommended for\nendophthalmitis patients with virulent infection. (Grade C)\nSystemic corticosteroid may be given. (Grade C)\nOral clarithromycin (500mg bd for 2 weeks) is recommended in culture\nnegative cases with poor clinical response. (Grade C)\nIntracameral tissue plasminogen activator (25mg in 0.1ml) is\nrecommended in patients with severe anterior chamber reaction. (Grade C)\nVitrectomy may have a role in improving prognosis. Therefore, early\nreferral for a vitreoretinal opinion is recommended. (Grade C)\nVitrectomy with or without silicone oil tamponade has been shown\nin recent case series, to increase the chance of surgical success\nand decrease the number of additional procedures in eyes with\npost-operative infectious endophthalmitis (75, Level 7). 4.2 Treatment of Chronic Post-operative Infectious\nEndophthalmitis\na. Antimicrobial therapy\nIntravitreal antibiotic is given to all patients with chronic postoperative endophthalmitis. The choice of intravitreal antibiotic is\nsimilar to that in acute post-operative endophthalmitis (76, Level 6; 4,\nLevel 9). The decision to use topical and systemic antimicrobials in chronic\npost-operative infectious endophthalmitis is the same as that for\nacute post-operative infectious endophthalmitis (26, Level 9).", "chunk_order": 11}

The decision to use topical and systemic antimicrobials in chronic\npost-operative infectious endophthalmitis is the same as that for\nacute post-operative infectious endophthalmitis (26, Level 9). For suspected fungal endophthalmitis, intravitreal amphotericin\nB (5ug or 10ug in 0.1ml) has been proven to be effective. Intravitreal miconazole (0.01mg in 0.1ml) should be considered\nfor fungi resistant to amphotericin B (76, level 9; 4, Level 9). Combined systemic therapy with amphotericin B and imidazole\nis effective in infection with Fusarium sp. whereas voriconazole\nor fluconazole is effective for Candida albicans. Itraconazole\ncan be used for other Candida species, Aspergillus or\nCryptococcus (77, Level 9). The indication for he use of systemic clarithromycin is as per\nacute post-operative endophthalmitis (66, Level 8; 67, Level 8; 26, level 9). b. Vitrectomy\nThere is insufficient evidence for or against vitrectomy in the\ntreatment of chronic post-operative endophthalmitis. However,\nin cases of suspected or confirmed Propionebacterium acnes or\nfungal endophthalmitis following cataract surgery, removal of IOL\nand posterior lens capsule with vitrectomy should be considered\n(4, Level 9; 18, Level 9). Refer algorithm for the management of chronic post-operative endophthalmitis\n5.
