Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2017 and will be reviewed in a minimum period of four years (2021) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope\nof the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

The quality of each retrieved evidence and its effect\nsize are carefully assessed/reviewed by the CPG Development\nGroup. In formulating the recommendations, overall balances of the\nfollowing aspects are considered in determining the strength of the\nrecommendations:-\n\u2022 overall quality of evidence\n\u2022 balance of benefits versus harms\n\u2022 values and preferences\n\u2022 resource implications\n\u2022 equity, feasibility and acceptability\nLevel\nI\nII-1\nII-2\nII-3\nIII\nStudy design\nEvidence from at least one properly randomised controlled trial\nEvidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without\nrandomisation\nEvidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control\nanalytic studies, preferably from more than one centre or\ngroup\nEvidence from multiple time series with or without intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the\nresults of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s)\ncould also be regarded as this type of evidence\nOpinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience;\ndescriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert\ncommittees\nManagement of Colorectal Carcinoma\nii\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe following recommendations were highlighted by the guidelines\nDevelopment Group as the key clinical recommendations that should\nbe prioritised for implementation.

Screening/Surveillance in Moderate and High Risk Groups\n\u2022 Asymptomatic individuals with positive family history should be\nscreened for colorectal carcinoma. \u2022 All individuals whose family history is suggestive of a hereditary\ncolorectal cancer syndrome should be referred to a clinical genetics\nservice for genetic risk assessment, where accessible. Diagnostic and Radiological Investigations for Staging\n\u2022 Computed tomography scan should be used for staging and\nsurveillance of colorectal carcinoma. \u2022 Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice in diagnosing\nand staging of rectal carcinoma. \u2022 In colorectal carcinoma, standardised histopathology reporting\nproforma incorporating tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging\nsystem should be used. Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\niii\nSurgical Management\n\u2022 Patients undergoing colorectal carcinoma surgery should have:\n\uf0a1 antibiotic prophylaxis\n\uf0a1 venous thromboembolism prophylaxis\n\u2022 A thorough surgical exploration should be performed at the time of\nresection in colorectal carcinoma. \u2022 Low rectal surgery should be performed by surgeons credentialed in\nthe management of rectal carcinoma. \u2022 Total mesorectal excision should be performed for middle and low\nrectal carcinoma. \u2022 If abdominoperineal resection (APR) is required, it should be\nperformed as cylindrical APR. Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy\n\u2022 Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for stage II colon\ncarcinoma with high risk features. Patient should be carefully selected\nand counselled. \u2022 Fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with oxaliplatin should be given in\nstage III colon carcinoma. \u2022 Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be offered to T3-T4 or node\npositive rectal carcinoma. \u2022 Palliative chemotherapy may be considered in metastatic colorectal\ncarcinoma. \uf0a1 Combination chemotherapy is the preferred regime. Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\niv\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these CPG were\nfrom the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Higher Education\n(MoHE). There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review\nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platforms: Guidelines International Network\n(G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews\n(CDSR) and Pubmed. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy. The inclusion criteria are all patients with colorectal\ncarcinoma regardless of study design. The search was limited to\nliterature published in the last 20 years and on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines\nwere searched and experts in the field contacted to identify relevant\nstudies. All searches were conducted from 7 May 2015 to 28 January\n2016. Literature search was repeated for all clinical questions at the\nend of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers\npublished before 30 April 2017 to be included.", "chunk_order": 2}

Future CPG updates\nwill consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details\nof the search strategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG\nSecretariat. Reference was also made to other guidelines as listed below:\n\u2022 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) - Diagnosis and\nManagement of Colorectal Cancer (December 2011)\n\u2022 New Zealand Guideline Group (NZGG) - Management of Early\nColorectal Cancer (May 2011)\n\u2022 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) - The\nDiagnosis and Management of Colorectal Cancer (November 2011)\nThe CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for\nResearch and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to it being used as reference. A total of 14 clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG members met 23 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\ndifferences in opinion are resolved consensually. The CPG was based\nManagement of Colorectal Carcinoma\nv\nlargely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical\ntrials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers.

Age-adjusted incidence rate\nwas 1.33 times higher among male than female. The incidence was\nhighest in Chinese followed by Malay and Indian. Overall mortality rate\nwas 9.8 cases per 100,000 population and age-adjusted mortality rate\nwas 1.42 times higher in male than female.2, level III\nThe most common presenting symptoms of CRC are altered bowel\nhabit (41.7%) followed by blood in stool (35.5%), abdominal pain\n(31.5%), weight loss (31.0%), anaemia (9.8%) and intestinal obstruction\n(9.3%).2, level III\nLeft-sided carcinoma is the commonest form and constitutes 81.8% of\nall notified cases. Majority of patients are at stage III and IV (54.36%)\nwhile only 8.4% are diagnosed at stage I according to the tumour-nodemetastasis (TNM) staging.2, level III\nThe estimated societal cost of CRC management in government\nhospitals in Malaysia using conventional chemotherapy ranges between\nRM13,622 to RM27,163 based on different stages, with an average of\nRM21,377 per patient. The cost of treatment is higher when combined\nconventional chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody is used.3 With\nincreasing number of new cases detected every year, the economic\nburden of CRC management is escalating especially if the patients\npresent in advanced stage. Management of patients with CRC consists of a comprehensive strategy\nof screening, diagnosis, staging, appropriate treatment and follow-up. Hence, this first national CPG on CRC is developed to assist healthcare\nproviders in the management of CRC. 2. SCREENING AND SURVEILLANCE\n2.1 Screening in Average Risk Population\nAverage risk population is defined as population with no known risk\nfor CRC. There is no retrievable evidence on the age to start CRC\nscreening for average risk population. This section is written based on\nrecommendation by existing guidelines on CRC and unpublished data\nfrom international and local cancer registries. Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\nMost of the major CRC guidelines recommend screening of CRC to\nstart at the age of 50 years old.4-5, level III\nDepending on the method used, the following screening intervals for\nCRC among average risk population recommended by major guidelines\nare shown in the following Table 1.5, level III; 6, level II-2; 7-8, level III\nTable 1. Screening Intervals for CRC Based on Methods\nThe US Preventive Task Force recommends screening for CRC to start\nat the age of 50 years and continues until age 75 years. The decision to\nscreen for CRC in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be individualised,\ntaking into account the patient\u2019s overall health and prior screening\nhistory.9, level III\n2.2 Screening Modalities\nMost CRC arise from adenomatous polyps that progress from small\nto large polyps and later to cancer.

The slow transition from polyps to\ncancers in most patients gives the window of opportunity for screening\nand early cancer detection. Multiple tests are available for CRC screening. Each test has its own\nstrength and weakness in the attributes of an ideal screening tool. a. Faecal Tests\nFaecal test is a non-invasive tool for screening CRC in general\npopulation. It can detect presence of blood, proteins e.g. enzyme M2PK and DNA. Faecal occult blood test (FOBT) has qualitative and quantitative testing\nmethods. In a meta-analysis of fair to high quality evidence, the pooled\nsensitivity to detect CRC was 74% (95% CI 62 to 83) for quantitative test\nmethods and 79% (95% CI 61 to 90) for qualitative test methods.9, level III\nImmunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) and guaiac-based FOBT (gFOBT)\nare two methods of qualitative FOBT. The sensitivities of iFOBT and\ngFOBT are 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.73) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.60)\nrespectively. The specificities of iFOBT and gFOBT are comparable\nat 0.85 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.87) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.82)\nMethodology\nFaecal occult blood\nStool DNA test\nCT colonography\nColonoscopy\nMinimum interval\nYearly\n3-yearly\n5-yearly\n10-yearly\nManagement of Colorectal Carcinoma\nrespectively.10, level I Screening with FOBT has a 16% reduction in the\nrisk of CRC mortality (RR=0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90).11, level I\nFaecal M2-PK test has a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 79% (95%\nCI 73 to 83) and 80% (95% CI 73 to 86) respectively.12, level I On the\nother hand, quantitative faecal DNA test has a higher sensitivity at 92%\n(95% CI 84 to 97) to detect CRC.9, level III These two faecal tests for CRC\nscreening are, however, not widely used locally in screening for general\npopulation due to high cost incurred. In a health technology assessment (HTA) report by MaHTAS, screening\nprogramme using iFOBT can be effective for prevention of advanced\nCRC (risk of developing advanced CRC was reduced by 28-46%) and\nreduced mortality by 23-60%. Regular iFOBT can detect pre-cancerous\nlesions and CRC in early stages and thus reduce mortality from\nCRC.13, level II-2\nb. Sigmoidoscopy\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy needs less rigorous bowel preparation and can\nbe performed as a clinic-based procedure without the need for sedation. Small polyps can be biopsied during procedure but excision of larger\nlesions (>1 cm) may be performed during subsequent colonoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy reduces the CRC incidence by 18-32% and mortality\nby 26-38% in general population. There is low incidence of bowel\nperforations associated with it.14-17, level I\nc.

Colon Capsule Endoscopy\nColon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is used to obtain images of the\ncolon by using video cameras embedded in an ingested capsule. The\ntechnique is less invasive but does not allow biopsy or polyp removal. CCE has a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI 66 to 76) and specificity of 75%\n(95% CI 66 to 83) for polyps of any size. It is a safe screening modality\nfor CRC with low rate (4.1%) of mild to moderate side effects such as\nnausea and abdominal pain.23, level II-2\ne. Computed Tomographic Colonography/Virtual Colonoscopy\nComputed Tomographic Colonography (CTC) uses multiple thin slice\ncomputed tomographic data to construct images of the bowel mucosa\nin two or three dimensions in detecting polyps. CTC requires bowel preparation similar to conventional colonoscopy\n(CC) and during the procedure, air or carbon dioxide is introduced into\nthe rectum via a rubber catheter. No sedation is required and patient is\nusually able to return to work post procedure. The sensitivity and specificity of CTC for the detection of adenomas\n\u22656 mm are 82.9% (95% CI 74 to 89) and 91.4% (95% CI 84 to 96)\nrespectively. For adenomas \u226510 mm, the sensitivity and specificity\nare higher at 87.9% (95% CI 82 to 92) and 97.6% (95% CI 95 to 99)\nrespectively.24, level II-2\nThe drawbacks of CTC include radiation exposure and the need for\ncolonoscopy after the identification of polyps for excision and tissue\ndiagnosis, while smaller lesions need to be followed up by surveillance\nCTC.

Carcinoembryonic Antigen\nThere is no recommendation made by the US Preventive Services\nTask Force, NICE guidelines and SIGN guidelines on the use of serum\ncarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test for CRC screening.25-26; 27, level III\nHence, it should not be relied on as a screening tool. Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\n\u2022 Based on a local economic evaluation conducted by MaHTAS,\niFOBT followed by colonoscopy shown to be the most cost-effective\nscreening strategy compared with no screening or colonoscopy\nalone with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of\nRM9,377.65.28\nRecommendation 1\n\u2022 Screening of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) should be offered at age of\n50 years and continues until age 75 years for average risk population. \u2022 Immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) is the preferred\nmethod to screen for CRC in average risk population. \u2022 If iFOBT is positive, an early colonoscopy is necessary. \u2022 If iFOBT is negative, yearly test should be performed. 2.3 Screening/Surveillance in Moderate and High Risk Groups\n2.3.1 Family History\nFamily history is a well-established risk factor for CRC.

PRIMARY CARE AND REFERRAL\nIn Malaysia, CRC screening is done mainly in primary care. Most of\nthe patients with symptomatic CRC often present at later stages of\nthe disease. In an attempt to improve early detection of CRC, various\nefforts have been done to establish CRC screening programme in\nprimary care setting. Therefore, one of the objectives of this CPG is to assist Family Medicine\nSpecialists and other primary care providers in providing structured\nscreening and referral programme according to the symptoms and risk\nstratification (refer to Algorithm A and B). Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\n4. DIAGNOSTIC AND RADIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR\nSTAGING\n4.1 Diagnostic Investigations\na. Colonoscopy\nComplete endoscopic colonoscopy is required in all suspected CRC\ncases in order to detect synchronous lesion and obtain biopsy specimen. b. Barium Enema\nBarium enema (BE) is the established radiological method to investigate\npatients with symptoms suggestive of CRC or large polyps in clinical\npractice although its utilisation is declining. Recent advent of virtual colonoscopy (VC) has shown to have a higher\nsensitivity than BE and patients prefer VC to BE. Detection rate of CRC\nor large polyps is significantly higher with VC than BE group (RR=1.31,\n95% CI 1.01 to 1.68). The rate is higher in large polyps (p=0.0098).64, level I\nc. Computed Tomographic Colonography/Virtual Colonoscopy\nAn evidence showed that CTC or VC is effective and safe in identifying\ncarcinoma and polyps >10 mm when compared with CC with high\nsensitivity and specificity.65, level II-2\nHowever, a more recent and larger evidence showed that CTC required\nadditional colonic investigation compared with colonoscopy (RR=3.65,\n95% CI 2.87 to 4.65). Almost half of the referrals after CTC were for\nsmall (<10 mm) polyps or clinical uncertainty. Detection rates of CRC or\nlarge polyps were 11% for both procedures. CTC missed 1 of 29 CRC\nand colonoscopy missed none (of 55). Serious adverse events were\nrare.66, level I\nAdvantages for CTC over CC are the ability to evaluate the whole\ncolon, particularly in the presence of a stenosing lesion, detect and\nstage CRC, and identify incidental pathology which may have a bearing\nupon management. \u2022 CTC is an alternative modality in diagnosing CRC in symptomatic\npatients at high risk of the disease. \u2022 Radiation exposure from CTC is approximately 20% lower than the\ntypical dose for double-contrast BE. \u2022 CTC is a more sensitive test than BE. It can be the preferred\nradiological test for patients with symptoms suggestive of CRC. Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\nd. Carcinoembryonic Antigen\nCEA is a glycoprotein present in normal mucosal cells and elevated\namount of CEA is associated with adenocarcinoma, especially in CRC. Therefore, it has a role as a tumour marker. However, normal level of\nCEA does not indicate absence of CRC. \u2022 The use of CEA is exclusively confined for monitoring and followup.

Computed Tomography\nComputed tomography (CT) is routinely used and remains the mainstay\ntechnique for primary staging and disease surveillance in patients with\nCRC. It is used for identification of the location and size of the lesion,\ndemonstration of local extension, and detection of distant metastases\nor complications such as perforation, obstruction or pericolic abscess\nformation.67, level III\nAlthough CT shows only 75% accuracy in identifying both T1 and T2\ncarcinoma, it has poor agreement between pre-operative CT staging\nwith the histopathology for individual T stages (\u03ba=0.208).67, level III\nFor T3 or more, the accuracy is higher at 86%. The accuracy for N stage\nhas been reported as high as 80%. Overall, CT scan has a sensitivity\nof 70.2% and specificity of 79.2% for T- and N-staging when compared\nwith histopathology staging.67, level III\n\u2022 CT accuracy in identifying CRC and nodal metastases depends on\nthe stages of the tumour. It is not the best modality for the assessment\nof early CRC. \u2022 Radiological staging for CRC must include contrasted CT thorax. \u2022 Radiological report must include pertinent findings for patient's\noptimal management including TNM classification. Management of Colorectal Carcinoma\nb. Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nThe optimal management of rectal carcinoma requires detailed preoperative planning that includes the assessment of the relation of\ntumour to the mesorectal fascia. Normal anatomy of rectum on magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) is as shown in Appendix 3. The presence\nor absence of tumour within 1 mm of the surgical circumferential\nresection margins (CRM) of the excised surgical specimen strongly\ninfluences outcome and is an independent predictor of survival and\nlocal recurrence.68, level III\nHigh resolution MRI consistently shows the mesorectal fascia. It could\npredict tumour at the potential CRM with an accuracy of 94% (95%\nCI 91 to 96) if the tumour is within 1 mm of the mesorectal fascia on\nthe scan. Thus, pre-operatively, MRI accurately predicts whether the\nsurgical resection margins will be clear or affected by tumour. It is also\nfeasible, reproducible and reliable for pre-operative staging.68, level III\nMRI also provides an accurate assessment of cancer local spread preoperatively. \u2022 MRI staging provides an accurate assessment of rectal carcinoma\nlocal spread pre-operatively.", "chunk_order": 18}

MRI predicts whether the surgical\nresection margins will be clear or affected by the carcinoma. MRI in Colorectal Carcinoma with Liver Metastasis\nAccurate assessment of the size, location and segmental distribution\nof liver metastases is critical for selection of patients to undergo\nradical surgery or minimally invasive therapy such as radiofrequency\nablation (RFA), cryoablation, chemoembolisation or radioembolisation. Although practice varies between treatment centres, the best methods\nfor detection of liver metastases from CRC are CT and MRI. MRI can\nbe used for characterisation of focal liver lesions. For small metastases\nto the liver, MRI with hepatocyte-specific contrast medium will facilitate\ndetection because of the high contrast between the avidly enhancing\nnormal liver parenchyma and the non-enhancing metastases in the\nhepatocellular phase of contrast uptake.69, level II-2\nIn performing the study, combined reading of images from both\ntechniques i.e. diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) with hepatocyte-\nspecific MR contrast medium such as gadolinium-ethoxybenzyldiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of colorectal liver metastasis\ndetection compared with parenchymal phase Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced\nManagement of Colorectal Carcinoma\nimaging or DW-MRI images alone. Combining DW-MRI with Gd-EOBDTPA-enhanced imaging set significantly improves the identification\nof liver metastases (AUC=0.96, 0.97) compared with reading of the\nGd-EOB-DTPA image set (AUC=0.86, 0.89) or the DW-MRI image set\nalone (p<0.016) (AUC=0.93, 0.92).69, level II-2\n\u2022 In MRI study, combined reading of DW-MRI images with hepatocytespecific contrast medium in the hepatocellular phase images are\nhighly suggested in detecting liver metastasis. c. Endorectal Ultrasound\nTwo meta-analyses showed that endorectal ultrasound is comparable\nto MRI in rectal carcinoma on:\n\u2022 T-staging (sensitivity of 0.88 vs 0.89, specificity of 0.79 vs 0.76)70, level I\n\u2022 N-staging (sensitivity of 0.63 vs 0.76, specificity of 0.80 vs 0.77)71, level I\nEndorectal ultrasound has high accuracy (pooled sensitivity of 0.97\nand specificity of 0.96) in assessing early rectal carcinoma and may be\nused with MRI in identifying patients who may benefit from endoscopic\nresection.72, level II-2\nHowever, endorectal ultrasound use is limited to non-stenosing tumours\nand its accuracy is significantly reduced in T- and N-staging among\npatients who have had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy\n(RT). Thus, MRI of pelvis is still the preferred choice of staging\ninvestigation of rectal carcinoma.70-71, level I\nd. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography CT\nFor detection of extrahepatic metastases and local recurrence of CRC,\nCT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT\n(FDG PET-CT) are commonly used.", "chunk_order": 19}

The aim is to\nachieve complete resection (R0) of the cancer. a. Colon Carcinoma\nA thorough surgical exploration of the abdomen should be performed\nat the time of resection. This is to exclude any possible synchronous\nlesion, assess the extent of primary disease and if there are any distant\nmetastases and to exclude any other coexisting pathology. The extent of bowel resection for colon carcinoma depends on the\nsite of the primary lesion, blood supply and lymphatics to the affected\nsegment. Complete mesocolic excision and flush ligation of the colonic\nvessels has demonstrated reduced risk of local recurrence (6.5% vs\n3.6%) and improved five-year survival rate (89.1% vs 82.1%) compared\nwith earlier techniques.87, level II-2\nTotal number of lymph nodes evaluated at the time of resection has\nbeen associated with survival.88, level I It is recommended that at least\n12 lymph nodes to be evaluated to assign N0 stage.89 Thus, surgery\nperformed should ensure at least 12 lymph nodes are harvested.

CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY\nWhile surgery remained the primary treatment for CRC, the roles\nof chemotherapy and RT are mainly as neoadjuvant, adjuvant and\npalliative options. The treatments for colon and rectal carcinoma are\noutlined in Algorithm C and Algorithm D. 6.1 Colon Carcinoma\na. Stage I and II Colon Carcinoma\nIn colon carcinoma without lymph node involvement (stage I and II),\nthe prognosis is good with surgical intervention alone. Stage II colon\ncarcinoma patients have a relatively favourable prognosis. However,\nsome patients with high risk stage II disease have a relapse rate\napproaching that of stage III colon carcinoma patients.108, level I\nIn a Cochrane systematic review of adjuvant therapy for completely\nresected stage II colon carcinoma, there was no improvement in OS\n(RRR=0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05). However, the DFS in patients who\nreceived adjuvant therapy was significantly better than without adjuvant\ntherapy (RRR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92). Most trials included in the\nreview used the combination of fluorouracil (5-FU) plus folinic acid, with\nor without levamisole.108, level I\nPrognostic indicators correlated with high risk for subsequent failure\nin stage II colon carcinoma include obstruction, poorly differentiated\ntumour, perforation, venous invasion, inadequate lymph node sampling\n(<12) or T4 disease. The benefit of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in\npatients with high risk features is not well established. The co-morbidities\nand likelihood of tolerating adjuvant systemic chemotherapy should be\nconsidered as well.108, level I Patients should be counselled carefully on\nthe risk of chemotherapy vs a potential small benefit of treatment.

Stage III Colon Carcinoma\nFor stage III disease, the recurrence rate can exceed 50% and adjuvant\nchemotherapy may have a role to reduce the risk of recurrence. The role of 5-FU based chemotherapy in stage III colon carcinoma is\nwell established in improving OS. Several 5-FU regimens are available\neither as infusion or bolus regimes, with different side effect profile but\nsimilar efficacy. QUASAR was a large trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for CRC using a\nstandard adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen, 5-FU and folinic\nacid with or without levamisole, in either a once-weekly or five-day\ncourse at four-weekly intervals. Both schedules were for six months\nduration. There was no difference in recurrence rates and survival at\nthree years as well as mortality rate between the weekly and four-weekly\nschedules.

Local recurrence rates were reported to\nbe as high as 50% for patients with T3-T4 and/or node positive rectal\ncarcinoma before the advent of standard CCRT and TME.114-116, level III\nRT to pelvis with or without chemotherapy plays an important role in\nthe management of rectal carcinoma. It may be given as short or long\ncourse schedule. TME has led to improvements in morbidity and survival in rectal\ncarcinoma. Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group investigated the value of\npre-operative short course RT of 25 Gy in five fractions in combination\nwith TME in rectal carcinoma. The 10-year cumulative incidence of\nlocal recurrence was 5% in RT and TME group compared with 11%\nin the TME alone group (p<0.0001). However, there was no difference\nin OS. For patients with TNM stage III cancer with negative CRM, the\n10-year survival was 50% in the pre-operative RT group vs 40% in the\nsurgery alone group (p=0.032).117, level I\n\u2022 A short course pre-operative RT is a treatment option for rectal\ncarcinoma.

Patients with good performance status,\nmarrow reserve and organ functions have a potential for benefits from\nchemotherapy. Patients with poor performance status and significant\nco-morbidities should be considered for supportive care only.127, level III\nPalliative chemotherapy to mCRC patients is effective in prolonging\ntime to disease progression (TTP) at 12 months (RR=0.86, 95% CI 0.77\nto 0.96) and OS at 18 months (RR=0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96).128, level I\n5-FU/LV is used clinically since 1957 and is the standard cytostatic\nagents in CRC.

FOLLOW-UP AND SURVEILLANCE\nSurveillance should be guided by presumed risk of recurrence and\nfunctional status of the patient (important within the first two to four\nyears). Any new, persistent or worsening symptoms warrant the\nconsideration of a recurrence. \u2022 Follow-up strategies in post-surgery and/or adjuvant treatment\nare:142, level III\ni. History, physical examination and CEA levels every three to six\nmonths for five years. ii. Surveillance colonoscopy at year one and every three to five years\nthereafter, dictated by the findings of the previous investigation. \u25cb If a colonoscopy has not been performed before diagnosis, it\nshould be done after completion of adjuvant therapy (before\none year). iii. CT scan of thorax, abdomen and pelvis is performed annually for\nthree years. For high-risk patients, it is reasonable to consider\nimaging every six to 12 months for the first three years.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of CPG is important as it helps in providing quality\nhealthcare services based on best available evidence applied to local\nscenario and expertise. Various factors and resource implications should\nbe considered for the success of the uptake in the CPG recommendations. 9.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe facilitating factors in implementing the CPG are:\n1. availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and softcopies)\n2. conferences and updates on management of CRC involving\nprofessional societies or bodies (Malaysian Society of Colorectal\nSurgeons, Malaysian Society of Gastroenterology & Hepatology,\nMalaysian Oncological Society)\n3. public awareness CRC campaign such as World Digestive Day, etc. Limiting factors in the CPG implementation include:\n1. limited awareness and knowledge in management of CRC among\nhealthcare providers\n2. different levels of CRC care due to expertise, facilities and financial\nconstraints\n9.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitments to:\n1. ensure widespread distribution of CPG to healthcare providers via\nprinted copies and online accessibility\n2. reinforce training of healthcare providers via regular seminars and\nworkshops\n3. involve multidisciplinary team at all levels of health care\n4. improve the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities\n5. train more experts in the field of CRC\n6. strengthen the cancer registry\nTo assist in the implementation of the CPG, the following is proposed as\nthe clinical audit indicator for quality management:\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of\nthe CPG by MoH which include Quick Reference and Training Module. =\nX 100%\nPercentage of\npatients with\npositive iFOBT or\nwith symptoms of\nCRC undergoing\nurgent colonoscopy\nwithin 2 weeks\nTotal number of patients with positive iFOBT\nor with symptoms of CRC\nreferred for urgent colonoscopy in\nthe same period\nNumber of patients with positive iFOBT\nor with symptoms of CRC undergoing\nurgent colonoscopy\nwithin 2 weeks in a period\nManagement of Colorectal Carcinoma\nREFERENCES\n1.
