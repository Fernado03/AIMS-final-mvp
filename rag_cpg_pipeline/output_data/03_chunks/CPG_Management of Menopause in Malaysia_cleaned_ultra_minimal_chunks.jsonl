This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on Management of Menopause in Malaysia, a\ncollaboration between the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Malaysia, the\nMalaysian Menopause Society along with the College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,\nAcademy of Medicine, Malaysia is an excellent start on what we can do for our aging\nwomen. Awareness of problems that menopause can bring, preventive strategies, early\ndetection, and menopause management are essential. We need to take away the\nmenopause \u201cvacuums\u2019 that have been created over the years and talk more openly about\nmenopausal health. Menopausal hormone therapy remains an effective option for menopausal symptoms. Robust clinical data has indicated the effectiveness and safety of these therapies in early\nmenopause. It is therefore important to reappraise the current evidence available and the\nproduction of this guideline is timely to encourage healthcare professionals to play an\nimportant role in promoting, counseling, and providing health education regarding\nmenopausal hormonal therapy. Thank you to the members of the expert panel, the review committee, HTA at MOH, and\nthe external reviewers for producing this clear and concise guideline. It is my fervent hope\nthat this CPG will help educate our healthcare workers to be proactive in managing\nmenopausal health, as preventive and early detection strategies can be implemented as\na woman goes through menopause\nKHAIRY JAMALUDDIN\nMINISTER OF HEALTH MALAYSIA\nFOREWARD\nM A N A G E M E N T O F M E N O PA U S E I N M A L AY S I A\nVIII\nLevels of Evidence\nDefinitions of levels of evidence by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health\nCare 2001\nFORMULATION OF RECOMMENDATION\nIn line with the new development in CPG methodology, the CPG unit of MaHTAS\nis adapting GRADING RECOMMENDATIONS, ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT\nand EVALUATION (GRADE) in its work process.

The Perimenopause\n1. \u0007Women\nexperiencing\nabnormal\nuterine\nbleeding\nin\nthe\nperimenopause should always be investigated based on the FIGO\nclassification system of PALM-COEIN (polyps, adenomyosis,\nleiomyoma, malignancy, coagulation disorders, ovulatory disorders,\nendometrial causes, iatrogenic causes and not otherwise classified). 15 (Level III)\n2. \u0007Clinical investigations for a woman with abnormal uterine bleeding\ninclude a vaginal examination, pap smear (in sexually active\nwomen) and a pelvic ultrasound to rule out local pelvic pathology. If a vaginal examination cannot be carried out, a pelvic ultrasound\non a full bladder would suffice. \u0007Blood investigations for anemia, thyroid dysfunction and\ncoagulation disorders (if necessary) are advised.15 (Level III)\n3. Women with perimenopausal symptoms are advised either the\n\u2022 \u0007low dose oral contraceptive pill as it acts as a contraceptive,\ngives better cycle control and treats perimenopausal symptoms. 14 (Level I)\n\u2022 \u0007menopausal hormone therapy which gives better cycle control\nand treats perimenopausal symptoms but is inadequate as\na contraceptive. Non-hormonal contraception is advised, if\nnecessary.15 (Level I)\n4. \u0007The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is an alternative\ntreatment for perimenopausal women with heavy menstrual\nbleeding. It acts as a contraceptive and provides endometrial\nprotection. Women requiring menopausal hormone therapy can\ncontinue using the LNG-IUS and add estrogen either orally or via\nthe transdermal route.16 (Level I)\nM A N A G E M E N T O F M E N O PA U S E I N M A L AY S I A\nX\nPremature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)\n1.", "chunk_order": 4}

DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this CPG comprised of\ngynaecologists (both from the Ministry of Education and the private sector)\nwho have been actively involved in the management of menopause in Malaysia,\nhaving run menopause clinics in their hospitals and published local papers\non menopause health in Malaysia. They were aided by an endocrinologist\nfrom the private sector who specialises in post-menopausal osteoporosis and\nmetabolic problems. There was active involvement of allied health care professionals in the\nmultidisciplinary review committee (RC) comprising of a family physician, an\noccupational health doctor, a pharmacist, a staff nurse and a doctor from East\nMalaysia so as to make this CPG as far reaching as possible. As this CPG is a\ncombined effort with the Ministry of Health and Academy of Medicine, the\nrepresentatives of each were present. Various ideas and suggestions were\nincorporated to complete this CPG. There were 10 meetings carried out in the offices of the Obstetrical and\nGynaecological Society of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. Two subsequent meetings\nwere in the meeting rooms of Pantai Hospital Kuala Lumpur. As the pandemic\nstruck, subsequent collaborations were through zoom. A review of current and past literature was made using electronic databases\nincluding Medscape, OVID, PubMed and the Cochrane Data base of Systemic\nReviews and Guidelines International Network (refer to Appendix 1 for\nExample of Search Strategy). Due to evolvement of hormone replacement\ntherapy since 1990, the search covered literature published from 1990 \u2013 April\n2021 on humans, specifically women and in English. In addition, the reference\nlists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in\nthe field contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom 12th August 2018 to 23rd Feb 2020. Literature search was repeated for\nall clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31st May 2021 to be included.

We looked into the national figures on prevalence and incidence of\ncardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and other long-term health issues. An indepth review of all local data pertaining to menopause, its long-term effects\nand the use of conventional hormone therapy and alternative therapy was\ncarried out.

Continuation of treatment can be carried\nout in the district hospital setting using the algorithm set in this CPG. Blood investigations, physical examinations including a pelvic examination\nand pap smear (if necessary), can be carried out at all levels of health care\nwith the guidelines set in this CPG. Mammograms and bone mineral density\nexaminations can be arranged periodically at district level hospitals or any\nhealth care facility. The availability of various menopausal hormone therapy is also scarce and\noften unavailable at the peripheral health centres. With clear guidelines drawn\nwith regards initiation, continuation and follow up of a woman whilst on MHT,\nit is hoped that the varied types of MHT become available for use. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS GUIDELINE\nThe successful implementation of this CPG is part of good clinical governance. \u2022\n\u0007Increasing public awareness towards menopause and its implications,\nmanagement strategies and the use of MHT if necessary. This could be\ncarried out by public forums in the various states of the countries. This\ncould also be carried out by appropriate sites in face book, in various\nmagazines, news and media. In view of the multi ethnicity of Malaysia,\ndispersing this message in the 3 main languages would reach a bigger\nfraction of the population. \u2022\n\u0007Making this CPG readily available in various medical society-based websites\nas listed above. This could be assessed by both the medical and public\nsector. \u2022\n\u0007Continuous medical educations (CME) programs either through workshops,\nmeetings or seminars. The Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Malaysia, the Malaysian\nMenopause Society and the Academy of Medicine (Chapter of Obstetrics\nand Gynaecology) would be working together towards implementing a\nMenopause Care Programme. This programme would involve an annually\nheld weekend structured course with post course assessment test and a\nsubsequent certificate as a \u201cMenopause Care Practitioner\u201d.

The diagnosis of menopause is made only after a woman has not\nhad a period for twelve full months.

It also marks the end of\nher fertility. The diagnosis of menopause is made only after a woman has not\nhad a period for twelve full months. As estrogen carries a protective effect on\nher organs, menopause then subjects a woman to various health problems\nand long-term morbidities. In 2021, the average life expectancy of a Malaysian woman was 78.3 years. 1 (Level II-3) As the average age of menopause in Malaysia is 50.7 years, one third\nor more of her life is now going to be spent in the post-menopause, a state of\nestrogen deficiency.2 (Level II-3)\nWhile many women tend to be worried about the vasomotor symptoms and\nskin changes that are associated with the menopausal change, the longterm effects of menopause are more alarming. Estrogen protects a woman\nagainst metabolic diseases. Malaysian statistics show a high incidence of\ndiabetes, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels in the local postmenopausal cohort. The increased abdominal fat layer that occurs in women\nafter menopause aggravates these medical health issues.3 (Level II-3)\nEstrogen protects the heart and with menopause, the risk of cardiovascular\ndisease increases. After the age of 55 years, the incidence of cardiovascular\ndisease in both Malaysian men and women are on par, with coronary heart\ndisease (CHD) being the leading cause of death for both sexes. Women\nunfortunately have an atypical presentation of CHD, which is usually\nprecipitated by microvascular heart disease. This is further exacerbated by\nmental and emotional stress rather than with exertion, as in the man. The risk of osteoporosis is doubled in post-menopausal women as compared\nto a man. By 2050, more than 50% of the world\u2019s hip fractures is projected to\noccur in Asia. Unfortunately, local data reveals a 20% mortality rate after a hip\nfracture with more than 40% of men and women always needing support or a\nwalking frame for the rest of their lives.4 (Level III)\nMalaysian women seldom talk of their symptoms related to the genitourinary\nsyndrome of menopause (GSM) such as bladder incontinence, vaginal\ndryness, painful intercourse and bleeding during sex (sexual health issues).

It is a retrospective\ndiagnosis. A woman is said to be in the menopause, when she has not\nhad any form of vaginal bleeding for 12 months after her last period, once\npathological or physiological causes have been ruled out.

It is also advised for women to prevent or manage\nchronic conditions that may occur with menopause. Benefits of MHT outweigh risks when given to healthy symptomatic women\nwho are less than 60 years or within 10 years of onset of menopause.97 (Level I)\nMHT is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM. It is the only known\ntreatment that has been shown to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures.97 (Level I)\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) study was a large double blinded,\nplacebo controlled, randomised study that assessed the effect of hormones\non the health of 160,000 women between the ages of 50 \u2013 79 years. The study\nhad two arms; one arm assessed the effect of conjugated equine estrogen\n(CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in women with a uterus whilst\nthe other arm assessed the effect of CEE alone in women without a uterus. In 2002 and 2004, both arms of the (WHI) study was prematurely stopped. The study with women on the combined therapy of CEE and MPA was halted\nat 5.6 years due to an increased risk of breast cancer and when other overall\nrisks exceeded benefits.", "chunk_order": 33}

The study with women on the combined therapy of CEE and MPA was halted\nat 5.6 years due to an increased risk of breast cancer and when other overall\nrisks exceeded benefits. The study with women on the estrogen only arm was\nhalted at 7.2 years due to an increased risk of stroke.98 (Level I)\nPost WHI, further breakdown of the data has shown that the benefits and risks\nof MHT vary with the woman\u2019s age, time since menopause, underlying health\nconditions, type of MHT used and delivery methods. The \u201ctiming hypothesis\u201d\nshowed that the risks with MHT use was lower in women closer to menopause\nonset than in those distant from the transition. In 2017, a cumulative observational follow of the WHI study revealed that\nwomen on hormone therapy, either CEE and MPA (non-hysterectomised\nwomen) or CEE alone (hysterectomised women), showed no increased risk of\nall-cause, cardiovascular or cancer mortality when compared to the women on\nthe placebo arm when followed up for 18 years.99 (Level I)\nWomen between 50 -59 years on the CEE and MPA combination showed a\nnon-significant lowered mortality trend towards CVD, cancer and other causes\nM A N A G E M E N T O F M E N O PA U S E I N M A L AY S I A\n28\nwhilst those on CEE alone showed a significant age-related lowered mortality\ntrend towards CVD, cancer and other causes.99 (Level I)\nThe use of MHT in healthy young menopausal women is safe.

The risks and benefits of MHT to the potential user is discussed\nand a well-informed decision is then made. (Appendix 5)\nMHT is approved for four indications97, 101 (Level I)\n\u2022\n\u0007Vasomotor symptoms (VMS): MHT reduces hot flushes and night sweats\nand is recommended as first line-therapy for women with moderate to\nsevere VMS.102 (Level I)\n\u2022\n\u0007Prevention of bone loss: MHT prevents bone loss and reduces fractures\nin menopausal women. MHT decreases the incidence of all fractures,\nincluding vertebral and hip fractures, even in women not at high risk\nof fracture. MHT is the only therapy available with proven efficacy of\nfracture reduction in patients with osteopenia.103,104 (Level I)\n\u2022\n\u0007Hypoestrogenism: For women with hypoestrogenism caused by\nhypogonadism, POI, or premature surgical menopause, hormonal\ntherapy either as the low dose COC or MHT is recommended at least until\nthe median age of menopause (50 years). Hormonal therapy relieves\nVMS, prevents bone loss, and improves cognition, mood disorders and\nimproves lipid profiles. A benefit- risk assessment is carried out annually\nif MHT is continued beyond 50 years.21 (Level II-3), 105, 106, 107, 108, 109 (Level I)\n\u2022\n\u0007Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM): In primary menopauserelated GSM issues, low-dose vaginal ET is recommended over systemic\nET as first-line hormonal therapy. MHT has been shown to effectively\nrestore genitourinary tract anatomy, increase superficial vaginal cells,\nreduce vaginal pH, and treat symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy\n(VVA).110 (Level I)\nContraindications to MHT include women with past or present history of the\nfollowing conditions:111 (Level I)\n\u2022\nBreast or endometrial cancer (any hormone related cancer). \u2022\nBlood clots, particularly in the lungs, eyes, or deep veins. \u2022\nHeart attack, stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA). \u2022\nLiver disease or liver problems.", "chunk_order": 35}

Hysterectomised women need estrogen therapy only (ET).101 (Level I)\nNon-hysterectomised women (intact uterus) require both estrogen and\nprogestogen (EPT). This can be given as a cyclical preparation (in perimenopausal women and up to the first year of the last period) or as continuous\ncombined preparation in postmenopausal women (one year after the last\nperiod).101 (Level I) (Appendix 6)\nCyclical therapy\nWomen in the perimenopause and up to one year from their last period are\nadvised the cyclical therapy; estrogen is administered daily while progestogen\nis added for at least 12-14 days of the cycle to provide endometrial protection. Women would experience regular monthly bleeds.112 (Level I). Continuous combined therapy\nWomen one year or more from their last period are advised the continuous\ncombined therapy, also called the \u201cno bleed therapy\u201d; estrogen and progestogen\nis taken daily. Initial spotting or staining (break through bleeding) is common\nup to six months, after which there should not be any bleeding 112 (Level I)\n\u2022\nUndiagnosed uterine or vaginal bleeding. \u2022\nPorphyria. \u2022\nPregnancy. Menopausal hormone therapy is approved for use in women\nexperiencing vasomotor symptoms, for prevention of bone loss and\nreduction of fractures, genitourinary syndrome of menopause and for\nwomen with hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism and premature\novarian insufficiency. 97, 101 (Level I)\nM A N A G E M E N T O F M E N O PA U S E I N M A L AY S I A\n31\nThe use of continuous combined preparations in perimenopausal women is not\nencouraged due to the increased risk of irregular bleeding. Perimenopausal\nwomen who are further away from their last menstrual period have lesser\nbreak through bleeding than those closer to their last period. Missing a pill or being non-compliant with the prescribed dosage may also\ncause irregular bleeding. Unscheduled bleeding beyond 6 months of use\nshould always be investigated.112 (Level I). Estrogen\nThe most commonly prescribed estrogen is estradiol valerate, estradiol\nhemihydrate, 17 beta estradiol and conjugated equine estrogen (CEE). Different\ntypes of estrogen have different effects on the brain, cardiovascular system,\nstroke and venous thromboembolism.113,114 (Level II-3) Please see Section 5.9.", "chunk_order": 36}

Many ethnic groups in\nMalaysia maintain separate cultural identities. This section will briefly deal with\nIslam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. All religions welcome menopause\npositively and this section is to share the views of the various religions with\nregards to menopause. Christianity\nChristianity understands that the process of menopause is part of God\u2019s\ndesign and that the postmenopausal woman should emerge stronger, more\nassured, and content. Being older allows time for freedom for service. During\nthe menopause transition period (which can be challenging), the Christian\nwoman can turn to God\u2019s words for wisdom to help her and her family. The\nChristian woman can be assured that God will never leave her or forsake her. If she is married, the Christian woman should confide in her husband and\ncommunicate about her menopausal symptoms especially if she is not able to\ncope. In God\u2019s teachings, husbands are to love their wives and to cherish them\nalways. Menopausal women should stay healthy and focus on overall health\nand not on body shape. She should exercise, not overeat, be in regular contact\nwith her doctor and consider treatment like hormone therapy if she so needs\nit.294 (Level II-3)\nHinduism\nHinduism views the begininng and the end of menstrual cycles positively. When a girl gets her first menses, a celebration would be held by worshipping\nthe Fertility Gods, and the girl be given gifts. Unfortunately the monthly\nmenses is considered a taboo and she is not allowed to enter temples and\nto participate in any religious acts.295 (Level II-3) Many women in the reproductive\nage group take hormones to delay their periods if they need to attend temple\nceremonies. Thus, menopause is a welcome sign for Hindu women. Women can\nnow enter temples and are able to perform religious rituals. The menopause is\ncelebrated as a period of freedom, experience, and wisdom. Taking MHT is not\na contraindication as overall health is paramount. Buddhism\nIn Buddhism, menopause represents a new phase of life. The menopausal\nwoman undergoes an energetic, psychological and spiritual shift and is born\nas a \u201cwise woman\u201d.

Menopause is much\nawaited for by the Buddhist woman.296 (Level II-3)\nIslam\nMenopause is welcomed by the Muslim woman. The lack of monthly menstrual\nbleeding gives them the freedom to perform religious activities (BAK). Aishah, the wife of the Prophet, once said that when women reached 50 years\nof age, they would be out of the menstrual age and would not deliver babies\nanymore. In the Al-Quran, from Surah An-Nur states, \u201cSuch elderly women are past the\nprospect of marriage, there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer)\ngarments, provided they make not wanton display of their beauty; but it is\nbest for them to be modest; and Allah is One Who sees and knows all things.\u201d\nThis verse from the Quran refers to the older woman and menopause. They\nare free to perform their religious responsibilities for Allah knows and sees\neverything. On 14th June 1998, the National Fatwa Council concluded on the following\nissues regarding MHT for menopausal women:297 (Level III)\nWhat is the Islamic perspective on menopause and HT? \u2022\n\u0007It is permissible to use MHT derived from the urine of pregnant horses. Characteristics of najis (colour, taste and smell) are removed after\nhormonal extraction. \u2022\n\u0007The transdermal method will prevent water from passing onto skin\nand must be removed before the bath cleaning from hadas (menstrual\nbleeding or after sex). \u2022\n\u0007Bleeding while on MHT is considered as hayd (menses) and thus all rules\nregarding menses apply. Can women pray (and/or perform other religious activities) when there is\nvaginal bleeding (due to MHT)? MHT is taken with the intention of taking care of their health so that they\ncan perform their duties towards the husbands and families.298 (Level III) Just like\nwomen with monthly menses before menopause, Muslim women cannot\nM A N A G E M E N T O F M E N O PA U S E I N M A L AY S I A\n102\nperform religious activities like the solat or read the Quran if they have cylical\nbleeds while on MHT.

This is to avoid\nsuspicion from the husband. During the perimenopausal period, women sometimes face the problem of\nprolonged periods due to dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). If a muslim\nwoman continues to bleed beyond two weeks (14 days), they are allowed\nto perform the solat. They have to clean the vaginal area and cover it with\na sanitary pad or cloth. They would then take the wudhuk (ablution) and\nperform the solat as soon as possible. They should do this everytime before\nsolat. The doctor should be consulted to determine the cause of the abnormal\nbleeding so that the woman may receive the appropriate treatment.
