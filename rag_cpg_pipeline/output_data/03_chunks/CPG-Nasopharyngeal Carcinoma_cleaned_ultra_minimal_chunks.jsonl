Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily\nguarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. These guidelines were issued in 2016 and will be reviewed in 2020 or\nsooner if new evidence becomes available. When it is due for updating,\nthe Chairman of the CPG or National Advisor of the related specialty\nwill be informed about it. A discussion will be done on the need for\na revision including the scope of the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary\nteam will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used\nby MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication. However, in the event of errors or\nomissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this\ndocument, which is the definitive version at all times. This version can\nbe found on the websites mentioned above.

There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review\nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platform: Guidelines International Network\n(G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews\n(CDSR) and Pubmed. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search\nStrategy). The inclusion criteria are all patients with nasopharyngeal\ncarcinoma (NPC) regardless of study design. The search was limited\nto literature published in the last 20 years and on humans and in\nEnglish. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify\nrelevant studies. All searches were conducted from 22 January 2015\nto 24 February 2016. Literature search was repeated for all clinical\nquestions at the end of the CPG development process allowing any\nrelevant papers published before 31 July 2016 to be included. Future\nCPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained upon request from\nthe CPG Secretariat. Reference was also made to other CPGs namely Nasopharyngeal\nCancer Treatment by Alberta Health Services published in 2013 and\nDiagnosis and Management of Head and Neck Cancer by Scottish\nIntercollegiate Guidelines Network published in 2006. The CPGs\nwere evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and\nEvaluation (AGREE) II prior to it being used as reference. A total of 10 clinical questions were developed under different\nsections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions\nwithin these sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The DG members met 23 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC.", "chunk_order": 2}

It is most common among Chinese but constitutes only\n0.7% of cancers worldwide.1, level I According to Global Cancer Statistic\n2008, the incidence rate of NPC is 1 per 100,000 people and it was\nestimated that men are two to three times more likely to develop NPC\nthan women.2, level III Geographically, Southeast Asia, Southern China,\nand North African countries have the highest prevalence of NPC\ncompared with other parts of the world. NPC is the fourth most common cancer among Malaysians (5.2%\nof all cancers).3, level III There are several risk factors associated with\nthe disease. NPC is usually diagnosed late due to trivial presentation\nof painless neck lump, blood stained saliva or nasal secretion and\nunilateral mild ear block.4-6, level III In view of late presentation, its\nsurvival outcome is poor. The optimal management of NPC involves\na multidisciplinary team. The main challenge for the team is for early\ndiagnosis to prompt access to treatment such as radiation therapy. For\nthose with intermediate or advanced disease, the aim is to minimise\ntreatment side effects without compromising the outcome. In view of high disease burden of NPC in Malaysia, variation in practice,\nresource implications as well as lack of local guidelines, the development\nof an evidence-based CPG for NPC is timely and essential to assist the\nhealthcare providers in managing the disease locally. 2.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND REFERRAL\n3.1 Clinical Presentation\nHealthcare providers need to be aware that NPC patients often present\nwith nonspecific symptoms and signs in the head and neck region. A proper clinical workup which begins with a detailed history of the\npresenting complaints is pertinent in diagnosing NPC. The most common presenting symptoms of NPC are:4-6, level III; 8, level III\n\u2022 neck lump/mass (42 - 80.8%) - always painless, can be unilateral or\nbilateral\n\u2022 nasal symptoms (26 - 49.8%) - blood-stained nasal discharge or\nsaliva, unilateral nose block, epistaxis or bad breath\n\u2022 ear symptoms (11 - 48.4%) - ear block, deafness, tinnitus or pain; the\nsymptoms are usually unilateral but can be bilateral as the disease\nprogresses\n\u2022 ophthalmo-neurologic symptoms (11 - 14.6%) - unilateral headache,\nfacial numbness, diplopia, ptosis, trismus, dysphagia or hoarseness\nof voice. The most common cranial nerve involvement is 5th followed\nby 6th, 3rd, 4th and others. The images of these symptoms can be viewed in Appendix 3. Majority of NPC patients in Malaysia present with advanced stage\n(Stages III/IV) at the time of diagnosis (75 - 85%). This is due to lack of\nawareness of NPC symptoms and signs among patients and doctors. 4, level III; 6, level III; 8, level III\n3.2 Referral\nThere is no evidence retrieved on referral criteria for patients with NPC. In view of delayed in diagnosis of NPC, the CPG DG uses consensus\nmethod to address the importance of referral to Otorhinolaryngology\nservices as soon as possible.

CPG Management of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma 2016\n6. TREATMENT\nMultidisciplinary team approach in the management of NPC cases is\nimportant to ensure optimum treatment planning. The main treatment\nfor NPC is radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. 6.1 Primary Cancer (Newly Diagnosed NPC)\nRadiation therapy (RT) is the main treatment modality for nondisseminated NPC. Chemotherapy plays a role as adjunct treatment\nto RT. It can be given as concurrent, adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. NPC is radiosensitive and thus radiation therapy is the mainstay of\ntreatment. Radical radiation therapy doses usually consist of 66 to 70Gy\nin 33-35 fractions, treated once daily over 6-7 weeks, usually 5 days a\nweek with two rest days. Conventional 2-dimensional radiation therapy\n(2D-CRT) used to be the main technique. With the understanding about\nbenefit of conformal radiation therapy and technological advancement,\nthe therapy has evolved to 3-dimensional radiation therapy (3D-CRT)\nand more recently intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). IMRT has the potential to deliver higher doses of radiation to tumour\ncells near critical structures such as salivary glands, optic apparatus,\nspinal cord, brain stem and pituitary gland. IMRT improves local control\nand progression free survival (PFS) for both early and advanced stage\nNPC.29, level II-2 A systematic review on IMRT to head and neck cancer\nshowed significant reduction in grade 2-4 xerostomia (HR=0.76, 95%CI\n0.66 to 0.87) without compromising loco-regional control and overall\nsurvival.30, level I\nThere is limited evidence on Stage II disease. In a cohort study of 362\npatients on RT alone, the 5-years overall survival (OS) was significantly\nlower at 73.1% in T2N1 compared with T1N0 (96.6%).31, level II-2 In a RCT\nconducted in 2011, concurrent chemotherapy improved the 5-year OS\ncompared with RT alone (94.5% vs 85.8%) with a reduction of death\nby 70% (HR of death=0.30, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.76).32, level I Guidelines by\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network 2013 and European Society\nfor Medical Oncology 2012 recommend CCRT in Stage II disease.33-34\nThere are strong evidences on chemotherapy added concurrently to\nRT in locoregionally advanced NPC (Stage III, IVA and IVB). Various\ncombinations of chemotherapy were used with platinum-based being\nthe commonest agent. \u2022 In a meta-analysis of 1500 patients, pooled data showed an\napproximate 20% improvement in 2- to 4-year survival with the\naddition of chemotherapy to standard external beam radiation\ntherapy.

The radiation dose\nthat might be given is 70.2-75.6 Gy.47, level III\nMultimodality treatment which include chemotherapy, radiotherapy with\nor without surgery increase survival rate significantly compared with best\nsupportive care or chemotherapy alone in metastatic NPC.48, level III\nPalliative care is very important in order to provide comfort and support\nto patients and families who are living with or dying from advanced NPC. These patients will have complex physical and psychosocial problems. A comprehensive approach of treatment such as surgery, radiotherapy,\nchemotherapy, psychological and social supports, pain control, nutritional\nand spiritual supports may alleviate some of the discomfort for a better\nquality of life.49 Palliative chemotherapy may be considered in patients\nwith good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance\nstatus of 0-2 as outlined in Appendix 7. For pain management in cancer patients, refer to CPG Management of\nCancer Pain.50\nRecommendation 6\n\u2022 Multimodality treatment including palliative care should be\nconsidered in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CPG Management of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma 2016\n7. SUPPORTIVE CARE\n7.1 Dental Care\nDental assessment prior to radiotherapy should be addressed early\nto allow sufficient healing time for any dental procedures.51, level III A\ncomprehensive dental assessment should include medical and dental\nhistory, extra- and intra-oral examination, necessary radiographs and\nany investigations required. Dental management in NPC emphasis on the importance of oral or\ndenture hygiene care, and use of ultra-soft toothbrush.52, level III Referral\nfor dental assessment is required and treated accordingly. 7.2 Treatment of Otitis Media with Effusion\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is common in NPC patients. The\ntreatment options for post-irradiation OME are:53, level I\n\u2022 Myringotomy plus grommet insertion\n\u2022 Simple aspiration (auripuncture)\n\u2022 Tympanic membrane fenestration with cauterization\nMyringotomy and grommet insertion has higher cure rate at the end of\n2-year follow-up compared with simple auripuncture plus aspiration (51%\nvs 38%, p=0.011) despite higher incidence of complications (28.9% vs\n15.6%).53, level I\n7.3 Contraception\nIdeally, highly effective reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine\nor implantable contraceptives, are recommended for women treated\nfor cancer including NPC. However, combined hormonal contraceptive\nmethods (containing oestrogen and progestin) should be avoided by\nwomen with active cancer or who have been treated for cancer in the\nlast six months due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism\n(VTE).", "chunk_order": 15}

Adequate nutrition is important for\nsupportive or palliative care to ease the treatment process and improve\nquality of life. Nutritional intake for NPC patients can be in the form of\noral, enteral and parenteral feed depending on patients\u2019 ability to tolerate\nCPG Management of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma 2016\nthe food and their requirements. Nutritional supplements may be used\nto maintain adequate calorie and nutrient intake which includes:49\n\u2022 Nutritionally complete supplements\n\u2022 Energy and protein supplements\n\u2022 Carbohydrate supplements\n\u2022 Protein supplements\n\u2022 Fat supplements\nCPG Management of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma 2016\n8. MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS\nPost-radiotherapy complications such as oral and aural complications,\nand cranial nerve palsies are common in the treatment of NPC. Other\nlate toxicities post-radiotherapy are listed in Appendix 8. 8.1 Oral Complications\nThe common oral complications post-radiotherapy are:\n\u2022 xerostomia (80% to 100%)55-57, level II-3\n\u2022 mucositis (60% from third to fourth week after the beginning of\nradiotherapy)55, level II-3\n\u2022 candidiasis (16% to 67%)55-57, level II-3\nIt is essential that NPC patients receive dental assessment prior to\nradiotherapy to minimise post-treatment oral complications. The oral\ncomplications among NPC survivors causes significant negative impact\nin functional, physical, social and handicap in oral health-related quality\nof life (Oral Health Impact Profile-subscale).58, level II-3\nAt present, there is no retrievable evidence on specific dental\nmanagement in NPC patients due to lack of clinical trials for such\ntreatment modality. However, some of the dental management for the\nhead and neck cancer includes:\n\u2022 fluoride therapy59, level I\n\u2022 chlorhexidine rinse59, level I (preferably alcohol-free)\n\u2022 dental extraction57, level II-3\nTreatment for xerostomia is limited. Locally, symptomatic relief such as\nfrequent sipping of plain water and the use of moisturising mouth gel\nor gargle has been offered to the affected patients. Although there is\nlimited evidence available, pilocarpine is an efficacious and safe option\nof treatment.60-62, level I\n8.2 Osteoradionecrosis\nDental diseases increase the risk of osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Therefore, dental assessment prior to radiotherapy is essential to\nreduce the risks of ORN. Osteoradionecrosis of the skull base post-radiotherapy can be\ncontrolled by sequestrectomy combined with hyperbaric oxygen in\nmajority of NPC patients. In extensive cases, radical sequestrectomy\nwith microvascular free flap reconstruction are justified.63, level III Longterm antibiotics can be used but may not be sufficient to treat an\nextensive disease.", "chunk_order": 16}

CPG Management of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma 2016\nRecommendation 7\n\u2022 All nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients should have dental\nassessment prior to radiotherapy and treated accordingly by\noral/dental specialists trained in dealing with patients receiving\nradiotherapy. \u2022 Pilocarpine may be offered for treatment of post-radiotherapy\nxerostomia in NPC patients, if it is available. 8.3 Cranial Nerve Palsy\nThere is no definite treatment for cranial nerve palsy post-radiotherapy\nin NPC patients. Symptomatic treatments such as nasogastric tube or\ngastrostomy tube feeding for dysphagia or aspiration may be offered. In intractable aspiration secondary to radiation encephalopathy or\nradiation damage of cranial nerve, closure of laryngotracheal cavity\nand tracheostomy is an option.64, level III Strabismus as a result of sixth\ncranial nerve palsy can be treated temporarily by Botulinum Toxin A\ninjection.65, level III\n8.4 Otitis Media with Effusion\nRefer to Subchapter 7.2 under Supportive Care. CPG Management of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma 2016\n9. PROGNOSIS AND FOLLOW-UP\n9.1 Prognosis\nDifferent prognostic categories (based on the difference in failure\npatterns) can be defined across different stages, as shown in Table 2. 66, level II-3; 67, level III These prognostic groupings have important\nimplications for the selection of appropriate treatment strategies. Table 2 : Prognosis of Different NPC Stages\nMales (p<0.05) and tumour with lymph nodes involvement (p<0.05)\nhave poorer prognosis as compared with females and tumour confined\nto the primary site in 5-year LRFS. The 5-year LRFS for male is 33.3%\nand for N1 patients is 35.0%.66, level II-3\nDistant metastasis is the most common mode of failure in NPC, followed\nby local recurrence. While a small percentage of locally recurrent NPC\ncan be salvaged, the vast majority of distant metastasis succumbs to\nthe disease. However, patients with non-disseminated NPC (6.88%)\nsurvive two years or more after distant metastasis is diagnosed.68, level II-3\n9.2 Follow-up\nRadiotherapy acute toxicities usually take about one to two months to\nresolve and tumour will regress maximally within two to three months. Hence, the patients need to be reviewed post-radiotherapy to assess\nacute toxicities and manage accordingly.", "chunk_order": 17}
