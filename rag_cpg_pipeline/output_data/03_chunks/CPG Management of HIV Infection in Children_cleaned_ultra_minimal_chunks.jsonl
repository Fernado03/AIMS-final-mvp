During\nthe process of development of this guideline, there was active involvement\nof a review committee which consisted of paediatricians from the public and\nprivate sector together with a public health specialist and a clinical virologist. This document is the first Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on the\nManagement of HIV infection in Children and Adolescents for Malaysia,\nupdating the 2nd Consensus Guideline (2001) and has been developed in\nparallel with the CPG on Management of HIV Infection in Pregnancy.

In Malaysia, the cumulative number of reported cases of HIV infection at end\n2006 was 76 389 with 5830 reported cases for 2006. While women constituted\nonly 1.16% of total new cases for 1990, this increased to 15.0% for 2006. Children below of age 12 years of age constituted 1.5% of total reported cases\nfor 2006, those aged 13-19 years 1.0% and those aged 20-29 years 2.7%.2\nThe vast majority of paediatric HIV infections are acquired vertically. Estimates from studies of prevention of mother-to-child transmission\n(PMTCT) suggest that in non-breastfeeding populations, about 50% of all\nHIV infections occur in the days before delivery and during labour and\nanother third occur during late labour and actual passage through the birth\ncanal. In breastfeeding populations, postnatal exposure could account for 40% of\nall transmissions. Studies suggest that transmission risk in infants who are\nexclusively breastfed is half that of infants who are given mixed feeding.3\nMalaysia introduced antenatal counselling and testing for HIV in 1998 and\nutilized the Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) 076 protocol for\nits PMTCT programme. From its introduction to the end of 2006, almost 3\nmillion pregnant women were screened, representing 99.5% coverage of all\nrecorded pregnancies. The prevalence of HIV-1 infection among pregnant\nwomen has remained an average of 0.036% over this time with an estimated\naverage perinatal transmission rate of 3.7% (median 3.95%)2. In developed countries, the number of children of HIV positive mothers\nnewly infected with HIV has decreased dramatically with a perinatal\ntransmission rate of <1% - a result of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and\nthe use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for pregnant HIV\ninfected mothers, the selection of lower risk delivery practices, neonatal\nARV prophylaxis, and lower risk approaches to infant feeding. Although studies and advances in the management of HIV infection among\nchildren and adolescents have lagged behind those in adults, there have\nbeen substantial advances in the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment and\nmonitoring of children exposed to and infected with HIV-1. MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nIn Malaysia, limited paediatric formulations have been made available by the\nMOH free of charge for patients and have enabled the provision of at least\nfirst and second line ARV drugs for children. Ongoing advances and research in PMTCT and the development of new\nARV drugs and improvements in strategies of ARV management are\noccurring at rapid pace. Major online references are provided and the\nreader is advised to look these up to obtain the latest data and information\non advances in HIV in children and adolescents.

MANAGEMENT OF THE PERINATALLY EXPOSED INFANT\n2.1\nHIV PROPHYLAXIS\nPREVENTION OF MOTHER -TO- CHILD TRANSMISSION (PMTCT)\nIn the absence of any intervention, the risk of MTCT is between 15 and 45%. However, several effective prevention measures have been identified that\ncan reduce the transmission rate to less than 2%. These interventions\ninclude ARV prophylaxis or HAART given to HIV-1 infected pregnant\nmothers, ARV prophylaxis for their newborn babies, safer approaches to\ndelivery (including elective caesarean section) and total substitution of\nbreastfeeding with infant formula. The Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG 076) protocol 4, Level 2 was the\nfirst major study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a 3-part (antenatal,\nintrapartum and neonatal) ZDV prophylactic regimen in reducing the MTCT\nby 68%. The protocol was rapidly adopted by many countries (including\nMalaysia in 1998), resulting in significant reduction in numbers of infected\ninfants. Over the years, many more trials have been conducted to evaluate\ndifferent ARV prophylactic regimens to reduce MTCT both in breastfeeding\nand non-breastfeeding populations. These trials have confirmed the efficacy\nof various regimens including ZDV alone, 5, Level 2; 6, Level 2; 7, Level 2; 8 Level 2; 9, Level 2; 10, Level\n6; 11, Level 1, ZDV + Lamivudine (3TC)12,Level 2; 13 Level 2;14, Level 2; 15, Level 6, single-dose\nnevirapine (sdNVP)16, Level 2; 17, Level 2 and more recently, combinations of ZDV +\nsdNVP 18, Level 2; 19, Level 6, ZDV + 3TC + sdNVP\n22, Level 9 and triple ART/HAART. 20, Level 6; 21, Level 6. Although several ARV regimens have been studied using different durations\nof either single or combined drugs, questions still remain regarding which\nregimen is the best in achieving the largest reduction in MTCT. Direct\ncomparisons between studies are often difficult as studies are done using\nvarious methodologies and are conducted in different study populations. MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\n3\nDespite these limitations, several conclusions can be drawn from the\nfindings of these studies:\nPREVENTION OF MOTHER TO CHILD TRANSMISSION (PMTCT)\nThree components of treatment or prophylaxis (i.e. antenatal, intrapartum\nand neonatal) are important as each component contributes towards\nreduction in the risk of mother- to-child transmission (MTCT). Longer courses of antenatal antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis or therapy\nbeginning earlier in pregnancy are more efficacious in reducing MTCT. Longer ARV prophylaxis for the infant is not a substitute for longer duration\nof the maternal antenatal component.", "chunk_order": 7}

However, regimens that provide\nlonger infant prophylaxis appear to be beneficial if the mother has\nreceived less than 4 weeks of HAART or ARV prophylaxis before delivery. Combination regimens are generally more efficacious than a single-drug\nregimen. Exposure to antiretroviral therapy or prophylaxis may induce development\nof viral resistance towards the drugs used (especially nevirapine, but\nalso lamivudine) in mothers and potentially also in their infants; this\nmay limit the choice or efficacy of antiretroviral therapies during the 6\nto 12 months following delivery. Adequate counselling, support and monitoring to ensure adherence to\nthe prescribed ARV regimen and chosen method of infant feeding are\nessential to PMTCT program success. Four commonly encountered perinatal scenarios and the recommended\napproaches to ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT are discussed below:\nAccording to the Malaysian CPG on Management of HIV Infection in\nPregnant Women (2008)23, Level 9, women with World Health Organisation\n(WHO) stage 3 or 4 disease or with CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 250\nper mm3 at diagnosis should be commenced on HAART, while those who are\nasymptomatic and with CD4 cell counts more than 250 per mm3 at diagnosis\nare given short term antiretroviral therapy (START). Scenario 1: HIV infected pregnant mother who is already on HAART\nThe risk of MTCT in this group is low but not negligible and depends on the\ndegree of viral suppression in the mother. The duration of ZDV for the infant\nis based on the data extrapolated from PACTG 076 study. As the evidence for the optimal duration of infant component of ZDV is still\ninconclusive, the current recommendations differ from country to country,\nranging from one week in some countries to four to six weeks in others.22, Level\n9; 24, Level 9;25, Level 9\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nScenario 1 - Recommendation for newborn infant whose mother is\non HAART\nThe newborn infant should receive zidovudine* syrup immediately after\nbirth and this is continued for a total duration of 6 weeks.

The HIVNET\n012 study\n16, Level 2; 27, Level 2 comparing sdNVP vs ZDV to mothers and infants\nshowed a 42% reduction in MTCT in the sdNVP group. The SAINT trial in\nSouth Africa 13, Level 2 which compared sdNVP with ZDV/3TC noted no significant\ndifference in transmission rate between the two regimens. Ameta-analysis 28, Level 1 of individual records of data fromAfrican MTCT prevention\ntrials indicated that a combination of ZDV and 3TC started during labour has\nsimilar efficacy to sd-NVP in preventing MTCT. MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\n5\nThe choice of ARV prophylaxis for the newborn infant will depend on the\nARV regimen received by the mother. The Malaysian CPG on Management\nof HIV Infection in Pregnant Women (2008)23, Level 9 recommends that an HIV\ninfected mother who presents in labour and who has not commenced\nHAART or ARV prophylaxis be given a combination of ZDV/3TC + sdNVP\nduring the intrapartum period. If Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS)\ncan be performed, the mother receives intravenous (IV) ZDV only. The\nnewborn infant receives sdNVP as soon as possible after birth and six\nweeks of ZDV.

Three studies have examined the situation where HIV infected mothers\nwere diagnosed late and had not received antenatal or intrapartum ART. A\ncohort study in New York 29, Level 6 found that administration of ZDV to a newborn\ninfant for 6 weeks was associated with a reduction in transmission, compared\nwith no intervention, provided that it was given within 48 hours of delivery\n(transmission rate 9.3% vs. 26.6%). A South African trial\n30, Level 2 in mixed\nfeeding infants comparing sdNVP with six weeks of ZDV showed no\ndifference in transmission rate at 12 weeks.

In such situations there may be concerns about\npossible adverse effects of maternal ART on the foetus. In addition, mothers\nmay have co-existing infections, in particular sexually transmissible\ninfections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB) thus exposing the foetus and\nneonate to such infections. A Swiss study reported a possible association between multiple ART and\npreterm labour,\n32, Level 6 although this was not observed in another study\ninvolving a larger number of HIV infected mothers.33, Level 6 The latter study\nhowever, seems to suggest a significant difference in the rate of very low\nbirth weight (VLBW) infants in those mothers who received a protease\ninhibitor (PI) compared to those who did not. The European Collaborative\nStudy\n34, Level 6, in its analysis of 3740 mother-infant pairs with 1973 infants\nexposed to ART (including 602 exposed to HAART) enrolled between 1986\nand 2003 identified 1.6% (31 of 1973) as having various congenital\nabnormalities. Congenital abnormalities were also noted in 1.4% (24 of\n1767) unexposed children. Concerns have been noted regarding an association\nbetween first trimester efavirenz exposure and neural tube defects based on\na study in monkeys and case reports in humans. 23, Level 9\nThus to date, current evidence suggests that there is no apparent increase\nin any particular abnormality with the use of ART or HAART during pregnancy.

In the absence of evidence from RCTs, recommendations on when to start\ncombination therapy in children (and adults) are based on cohort data that\nprovide an estimate of the risk of progression to AIDS or death based on\nsurrogate markers of infection (i.e. the child's CD4 % and pVL). An important meta-analysis,145, Level 1 of individual data of 3941 children from\n17 studies in Europe and US demonstrated short-term risks (12 months) of\nprogression to AIDS or death at different ages based on child's presenting\nCD4% and pVL, with the former being the stronger predictor (Appendix 3).

Poor adherence is likely to result in subtherapeutic ARV levels with risk for\nvirologic failure and emergence of drug resistance, thus not only affecting\ncurrent regimen but also limiting future drug options. Adherence is a major issue in paediatric treatment and there is evidence\nthat adherence problems are common in children. In one study, 43% of\npeople caring for a child receiving HAART reported at least one missed dose\nin the past week.207, Level 8 A number of factors could contribute to adherence\nproblems: high pill/medication burden; refusal of young infants to take\nsyrups due to unpleasant taste; unwillingness among caregivers to inform\nschools and care-centres that their child is infected, which could result in\nmissing out on doses during the day; dietary restrictions; and toxic side\neffects of drugs. l) Adherence assessment and monitoring\nA comprehensive assessment for adherence should be carried out prior to\ninitiation of therapy and should include social, behavioural, family and financial\nfactors that may affect adherence by the child and family and to identify\nareas for intervention.

In a\nprospective cohort study from Thailand,210, Level 6 the incidence of IRIS was\n19% and median time of onset 4 weeks after start of HAART (range, 2-31\nweeks). The majority were caused by mycobacterial organisms, followed by\nvaricella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus and by Cryptococcus neoformans. 1 episode of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was reported. Features included\nexacerbation (often with unusual manifestations) of a previously treated OI,\nor unmasking of a previously subclinical infection. Risk factors for IRIS have not been clearly defined. Factors associated with\nthis condition include lower baseline CD4 at initiation of therapy, higher\nbaseline VL, a rise in CD4 after 90 days and a rapid fall in HIV RNA level\nduring the first 3 months of therapy. Pathogenesis of IRIS is not fully understood but suggested mechanisms\ninclude recovery of antigen specific immune response, response to high\nantigen burden, dysregulation of the immune response and disease\nsusceptibility genes. Most cases of IRIS resolve after a few weeks, however some can be severe\nwith significant morbidity and occasional mortality. Treatment is directed to\nthe specific aetiology by initiating or continuing specific therapy. A course of\ncorticosteroids (prednisolone or methylprednisolone) for life threatening or\nunresponsive inflammatory responses may be necessary. ART should be\ncontinued but interruption may need to be considered in severe or\nunresponsive cases. Recommendation for Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome\nClinicians initiating HAART should remain vigilant for the occurrence of\nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome. (Grade C)\nTreatment is directed towards the specific aetiology though steroids\nmay need to be given in the severe cases. (Grade C)\nAntireroviral therapy should not be interrupted except in very severe or\nunresponsive cases. (Grade C)\n3.2.4 Special issues for adolescents\nAdolescents diagnosed with HIV infection have either been infected by\nhorizontal transmission (sexual, injecting drug use) or are adolescent\nsurvivors of perinatal infection. Differences have been described in the natural history and progression of\nHIV infection in adolescents when compared with adults. Although\nadolescents may be more susceptible to HIV infection, they have better\nthymic reserve, demonstrate less rapid disease progression and perhaps\nbetter immune reconstitution with treatment.211, Level 8\nAdolescence is a time of rapid physical, cognitive and social changes which\nmay influence disease progression and ongoing care. Combined management\nwith an adolescent physician is beneficial. Important elements of care\ninclude access to age-appropriate health care, mental health and substance\nabuse services, peer-to-peer support, sexual health, routine screening for\nsexually transmitted infections, risk reduction counselling and contraceptive\ncounselling.

In the PACTG 381 study, 212, Level 8only 24% of\nadolescents on HAART were completely adherent to their regimen. b) Dosing\nIt is recommended that prepubescent adolescents (Tanner stage I or II)\nshould be dosed according to paediatric guidelines while those in late puberty\n(Tanner stage V) should receive adult doses. Refer Appendix 5 for details on\nTanner staging\nc) Adolescent Females\nGynecological care is an important part of care for the HIV infected female\nadolescent. Adolescents with HIV infection may be sexually active, therefore\ncontraception and prevention of HIV transmission should be discussed,\nincluding the interaction of specific ARV drugs with hormonal contraceptive\nagents. The potential for pregnancy must be considered and this may alter\nchoices of antiretroviral therapy. For example, efavirenz should be used with\ncaution in females of child bearing age and should only be prescribed after\nintensive counselling and education about the potential effects on the\nfoetus. PMTCT strategies and regimens during pregnancy are described in\nthe relevant CPGs. 38\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nd) Barriers to ART Adherence\nBarriers to adherence among adolescents include those related to development\nsuch as denial, mistrust, rebellion, concrete thinking and other issues such\nas fear of disclosure, poor understanding, chaotic lifestyle, substance abuse\nand lack of family support. Low self- esteem, depression and feelings of\nhopelessness are other common factors. Efforts need to be focused on reinforcing adherence as described above\nand include pillboxes, timers, reminder systems, peer-to-peer adherence\ncounselling. A lower pill burden, (e.g. co- formulated fixed dose combinations\nand drugs with daily dosing (e.g. Tenofovir) and regimens with minimal\nadverse effects all facilitate adherence. e)Transition to Adult Care\nTransition is facilitated if adult clinics are in the same facility, and where one\nor more providers work in both settings with similar multidisciplinary support. 3.2.5 Treatment failure\nMost children can remain stable on HAART for many years.

MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\n4. COMMON OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS (OI) AND\nCOMPLICATIONS IN HIV INFECTED CHILDREN\n4.1\nPATTERN OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS\nThe pattern of opportunistic infections (OI) among HIV infected children\ndiffers from that of adults. Many OI in adults are secondary to reactivation of\npreviously acquired opportunistic pathogens, which were acquired when\nhost immunity was intact. However, OI among HIV infected children more\noften reflect primary infection with the pathogen. In addition, among children\nwith perinatal HIV infection, the primary infection with the opportunistic\npathogen is occurring after HIV infection is established when the child's\nimmune system might already be compromised. 218, Level 9\nIn general children with HIV infection are at increased risk of bacterial infections\nsuch as diarrhoeal disease and pneumonia. Common bacterial pathogens\ninclude Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, non-typhi Salmonellae and other\ngram-negative organisms.219, Level 5\nThe data for OI locally and globally are limited. A large multicentre prospective\ncohort study from the USA (2767 enrolled) has shown the incidence of OI\nhas decreased in the HAART era.219, Level 5 The most common OI in this study\nwas bacterial pneumonia with a Cumulative Incident Rate (CIR) of 2.15 per\n100 person-years(py). It accounted for 22.2% of all OI. The other OIs found\nwere\nHerpes\nzoster/varicella\n(CIR\n1.55/py),\ndermatophyte\ninfections (IR 0.88/py) and oral candiasis (CIR 0.93/py) Similar findings were\nseen in another prospective cohort study.225, Level 5\nIn descriptive studies from developing and less developed countries\nbacterial pneumonia and sepsis are also the most common OIs. However\nunlike data from the USA, PCP and pulmonary tuberculosis seem to be\nmore common.221,Level 8; 222, Level 8 In Thailand, disseminated infection with the\nfungus Penicillium marneffei is one of the most common opportunistic\ninfections.", "chunk_order": 45}

In this same study Chintu\net al 128 , Level 2\nalso showed a 23% reduction in hospital admission. MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nWHO recommends that TMP/SMX be offered to asymptomatic (WHO Stage\n1) children with CD4 <25% (<5 years of age), CD4 < 200/ \u00b5l (> 5 years of\nage) and all symptomatic (WHO Stage 2, 3 or 4) children older than 12\nmonths, regardless of CD4 percentage or count.129 , Level 9\nCommencing a patient on TMP/SMX prophylaxis also provides the opportunity\nto assess likely adherence when HAART is eventually commenced. 4.2 (a) Dosage and regimens of co-trimoxazole for OI prophylaxis\nVarious dosages have been used for the prophylaxis, these are usually\nbased on weight, surface area or age. WHO Expert Consultation on\nTMP/SMX prophylaxis in HIV infection report dated May 2005 recommends\ndaily doses according to age categories. 129 , Level 9\nThe Zambian RCT also used age categories for dosing (40mg TMP/200mg\nSMX daily for children less than 5 years and 80mg TMP/400mg SMX for\nmore than 5 years of age). 128, Level 2 A recommendation for dosage extrapolated\nfrom these studies is 3-6mg/kg TMP/15-18mg/kg SMX daily. 4.2 (b) Safety of PCP prophylaxis medications\nIn a large RCT among children there was no significant difference in the\nincidence of adverse effects between placebo and co-trimoxazole.128, Level 8\nMadhi reported that skin rash was the main side effect (2.8%) in infants\ngiven co-trimoxazole.124, Level 8 Other possible side effects include bone\nmarrow toxicity and hepatotoxicity.129, Level 9 These side effects may be\nmonitored on a clinical basis, using a symptomatic approach129, Level 9 Dapsone\nand aerosolized pentamidine are alternatives for a child who is intolerant to\nco-trimoxazole.", "chunk_order": 46}

NON INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS OF HIV\nIn addition to secondary infections, health care personnel managing HIV\ninfected children should be vigilant of the non-infectious complications of HIV. 5.1\nMALIGNANCY\nThere is an increased incidence of malignant disease in children with\nvertically acquired HIV infection.227, Level 8 However, the number of children with\nHIV infection who develop a malignancy is poorly defined. The tumours\nseen in HIV infected children are somewhat different than those in adults\nand the spectrum appears to be age-dependent. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is\nthe most common cancer in HIV infected children. Other significant\nmalignancies occurring in children withAIDS are Kaposi sarcoma, Hodgkin disease,\nprimary brain lymphomas and leiomyosarcoma.227, Level 8; 228, Level 8\n5.2\nNEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS\nNon-infectious neurologic manifestations of AIDS were reported to occur\namong 10% of patients less than 18 years of age. 229, Level 8 They presented\nwith a variety of neurological manifestations including focal motor signs,\naltered tonus, retarded neurodevelopment, cognitive disturbances, intractable\nheadache, seizures, and coma.

Other reported glomerular lesions in patients with HIV\ninclude IgA nephropathy and cryoglobulinemia.230, Level 8 ;231, Level 8\n5.4\nCARDIAC COMPLICATIONS\nHIV infected children developed cardiac complications ranging from clinically\nsilent lesions to fatal disease.232, Level 8 The reported complications include left\nventricular dysfunction, cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion.

Affected children tend to have a better\nprognosis than children without LIP but secondary bacterial pneumonias\nand eventual bronchiectasis are common. LIP is classified as non-AIDS and\nStage 3 (WHO Classification). Clinical features that are often associated with LIP include generalised and\nsymmetrical lymphadenopathy, bilateral chronic non-tender parotid swelling,\ndigital clubbing and hepatomegaly. Typical radiographic findings are diffuse\nbilateral reticulonodular infiltrates. ART improves symptoms and radiographic\nappearances of LIP and resolution of LIP has been reported among adults\nreceiving HAART 235, Level 9; 236, Level 9\n6. OTHER ISSUES\n6.1\nDISCLOSURE\nPerinatally acquired HIV infection has become a chronic illness due to\nadvances in medical treatment. As an increasing number of children infected\nwith HIV live to older ages, the question of disclosure of the diagnosis (to the\nchild and others) becomes more crucial. This maybe particularly challenging\nwhen children reach school going age. Their psychosocial needs are also\nchanging to more closely resemble the needs of the chronically ill individual,\nrather than the terminally ill. Disclosure of the child's HIV diagnosis is\ncontroversial and an emotionally laden issue. The importance of disclosure\nrelates directly to medication adherence, treatment compliance, child's\ndeveloping autonomy and avoids potential transmission to sexual partners.

MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\n6.1.1 Disclosure rates\nIn a Thai study involving primary caregivers of 96 HIV infected children aged\n5 years and older; disclosure was made to only one in 5 HIV infected\nchildren. Common reasons for non-disclosing were concerns that the child\nwas too young, that the child might be psychologically harmed, and that the\nchild could not keep the secret.237, Level 8 The fear of the negative impact on the\nfamily due to the stigma associated with HIV infection or 'AIDS' is also a\nreason for families to avoid disclosure.244,Level 9; 245,Level 9 However, Battles et al\nreported that disclosure was found to be positively related to social support,\nself-competence, and decreased problem behavior except in the case of\npublic disclosure.240, Level 9\n6.1.2 Disclosure and adherence\nAdherence to daily drug regimens is an important aspect of management. Among the factors that can influence adherence is the disclosure of\ndiagnosis to the child. Using in-depth interviews of 42 HIV infected children\non treatment and their care givers in a HIV clinic (Uganda) it was noted that\ncomplete disclosure by caregivers to children & strong parental relationships\nwere related to good adherence.241, Level 8 In Puerto Rico 70% HIV positive\nyouth had feelings of normalcy 6 months post-disclosure and most also\nimproved their adherence to therapy after disclosure. Eighty-five percent of\nyouth and 97% of caregivers considered disclosure a positive event for\nthemselves and their families.242, Level 8\n6.1.3 When and how\nIn a Thai cross-sectional study conducted among 103 care givers of HIV\ninfected children aged >6 years who were receiving HAART, disclosure\nrates were 30% and the average age for disclosure was 9.2 years.", "chunk_order": 49}

(Grade C)\nThis process should take into consideration the child's cognitive ability,\ndevelopmental stage, clinical status, social circumstances, knowledge\nand coping capacity. (Grade C)\nDisclosure of HIV infection status should be encouraged by schoolgoing age (7-10 years) and should be achieved by 15 years of age.

An HIV infected child's parent or guardian is not obliged to disclose the\nstudent's HIV status to school personnel. Realistically in a need to know\nsituation, no more than two staff need to know if a pupil is affected or infected\nby HIV. One would normally be the head teacher and the other a designated\nstaff member, ideally chosen by the pupil and parent, who can oversee the\nchild's education, care and well-being and provide supportive counselling\nwhen necessary. The majority of infected children spend their school career\nhealthy, but they may need time off for medical appointments and may\noccasionally have periods in hospital. The role of the head teacher will be to\nsupport the designated staff member, to discuss any issues with him or her\nand to instigate any discussion between parents and the school on issues\nthat arise concerning the pupil's education or well-being.247, Level 9\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\nMANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION IN CHILDREN\n51\n6.2\nAGE APPROPRIATE EDUCATIONAL & LIFESTYLE ADVICE FOR\nCHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\nHIV infected children, adolescents and their caregivers should be given\nappropriate advice regarding behaviour and lifestyle to minimize the risk of\nHIV transmission. The advice provided must be appropriate to the age and\nmaturity of the child. The risk of a young child infecting others is extremely small. Although HIV\nhas been isolated in the saliva, tears, urine and faeces, there is no evidence\nthat HIV can be acquired through casual contact with these sources.246, Level 9\nFamilies and caregivers should be assured that sharing of household\nutensils, linen, clothes, personal hygiene products and close daily interactions\n(including kissing) are safe and do not result in the transmission of HIV. Having an infected child in a day-care centre or school poses no risk to staff\nor other children. No case has ever been recorded of HIV transmission from\nchild to child by playing, fighting or any other normal childhood interaction. Although biting poses a theoretical risk of transmission, the risk is believed\nto be extremely low. 249, Level 9 ; 250, Level 9 If an infected child has a cut or graze, this\nshould be dealt with in the normal manner following first aid procedures and\nstandard hygiene practices. Schools should be assisted to develop a norm\nin which universal or standard precautions for infection control are routinely\nemployed by staff and students (see Appendix 9 for additional resources).
