After development, the guidelines were scrutinized by an internal review\ncommittee who gave feedback primarily on the comprehensiveness\nof the guidelines and accuracy of the interpretation of evidences\nsupporting the recommendations in the guidelines. A respected clinician and academic was invited as external reviewer\nand provided useful feedback on the guidelines. The previous edition of the CPG on Antibiotic Prophylaxis against\nWound Infection for Oral Surgical Procedures (August 2003) was used\nas a reference. Several changes have been made in these updated guidelines. Sections\non periodontal surgery, cancer surgery and surgery in previously\nirradiated bone have been included. The section on trauma has been\nsimplified. There are also some changes in the choice and regime of\nthe recommended antibiotics. In addition to the new and updated\ninformation, key messages are given where the available evidence is\ntoo weak to make a recommendation. Clinical audit indicators have been identified for the purpose of\nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes and are recommended for use in\nindividual centres. In reviewing these guidelines, publications from the year 2003 onwards\nwere retrieved and scrutinized.", "chunk_order": 0}

Clinical audit indicators have been identified for the purpose of\nmonitoring and evaluating outcomes and are recommended for use in\nindividual centres. In reviewing these guidelines, publications from the year 2003 onwards\nwere retrieved and scrutinized. A literature search was carried out using\nthe following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE; Cochrane\nDatabase of Systemic Reviews (CDSR); ISI Web of Knowledge and\nfull text journal articles via the OVID search engine. In addition, the\nreference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify\nfurther studies. Free text terms or MeSH terms were used either singly\nor in combination to retrieve the articles (Appendix 1). Only literature\nin English was retrieved. Each article retrieved was appraised by at\nleast two members. The selected articles were assigned their evidence\nlevel according to the U.S./Canadian Preventive Services Task Force\nguide and the key information in each article was presented in an\nevidence table. These were then discussed during group meetings. Recommendations made were graded according to the Scottish\nIntercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guide. All statements\nand recommendations formulated were agreed upon by both the\ndevelopment group and review committee. The recommendations in this CPG were made taking into consideration\nboth current scientific evidence as well as local circumstances. Where\nthere was lack of or weak evidence, recommendations were made\nbased on consensus of the group members. The draft guidelines were also posted on the Ministry of Health website\nfor comments and feedback. The final draft of the CPG was presented\nto the Technical Advisory Committee for CPGs, the Health Technology\nAssessment (HTA) division and the CPG Council of the Ministry of\nHealth, Malaysia for approval. OBJECTIVE\nThe main aim of these guidelines is to assist dental practitioners make\ninformed decisions on prophylactic antibiotic use in the prevention of\noral surgical site infections. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\n1. To identify the procedures in oral surgery that would benefit from\nsurgical antibiotic prophylaxis. 2. To assist in deciding which antibiotics to prescribe and what\nregime to follow if prophylactic antibiotics are indicated. CLINICAL QUESTIONS\nThe clinical questions addressed by the guidelines are:\ni. When are antibiotics indicated for the prevention of surgical site\ninfections in oral surgery? ii. What antibiotics are appropriate in surgical prophylaxis? iii. Could the inappropriate use of antibiotics in surgical prophylaxis\nbe reduced or eliminated? TARGET POPULATION\nThese guidelines are applicable to patients undergoing oral and\nmaxillofacial (OMF) surgical procedures. TARGET GROUP/USER\nThese guidelines will be useful for oral and maxillofacial surgeons as\nwell as dental practitioners involved in the surgical management of\npatients.

From these studies several important\nprinciples were established which remain valid to this day:\ni) Our body\u2019s defence against bacteria depends primarily on its\nown natural resistance. ii) The risk of infection can be decreased and sometimes\nprevented by supplementing the body\u2019s natural resistance\nwith antibiotics. iii) Antibiotics must be delivered before bacterial contamination\nof the tissue occurs. iv) Antibiotics serve no purpose if they are administered after the\nend of the period of active bacterial contamination. There are however significant risks associated with antibiotic use. When an antibiotic is administered, strains of bacteria sensitive\nto the antibiotic are killed allowing the proliferation of resistant\nstrains. Repeated \u2018selection\u2019 of resistant strains of bacteria would\neventually render the antibiotic ineffective for prophylaxis or\ntreatment of infections associated with these bacteria. Antibiotic\nchoice is becoming increasingly limited by antimicrobial\nresistance6, level III and new antibiotic discovery is not keeping pace\nwith the rates of this antimicrobial resistance.7, level III\nAlso, an antibiotic administered to a patient can act as an\nantigenic stimulus and hence produce an allergic reaction.", "chunk_order": 3}

Allergic reactions manifest either locally or systemically at\nvarying degrees of severity ranging from minor skin lesions to\nanaphylactic shock and death. Antibiotics in general should be used only when the benefits\noutweigh the risks to the patient and are therefore only indicated\nwhen the consequence of infection is severe or when the\nincidence of infection is high. 2.0 INDICATIONS FOR PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control\u2019s (CDC) National\nNosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) classification system\nfor the risk of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) which is based on a\nlarge multicentre study (Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial\nInfection Control - SENIC) lists multiple factors that increase the\nrisk of SSI.8, level II-2 These factors include:\n\u2022 Patients with underlying medical problems (ASA score)\n\u2022 Wound class\n\u2022 Duration of surgery\nOther factors such as previous exposure of the site of the surgery\nto radiotherapy may also increase the risk of SSI. 2.1 Patients with underlying medical problems\nA Swedish Systematic Review of the Literature did not find any\nclinical trials on antibiotic prophylaxis in medically compromised\npatients other than patients with heart disease. The authors noted\nthat despite the lack of evidence, recommendations in Sweden\ninclude many different medical conditions for which antibiotic\nprophylaxis should be used.9, level 1\nA Cochrane Review stated that though there is some evidence\nthat prophylactic antibiotics can reduce infection and dry sockets\nfollowing third molar extraction, it was unclear whether the\nevidence in the review is generalizable to those with concomitant\nillnesses or immunode\ufb01ciency. They however concluded that such\npatients are more likely to bene\ufb01t from prophylactic antibiotics,\nbecause infections in them are likely to be more frequently\nassociated with complications and be more dif\ufb01cult to treat.10, level 1\nThe French Health Products Safety Agency Recommendations\nstates that patients with certain medical conditions have\nan increased susceptibility to infection which would include\noncological patients, patients with congenital or immunological\nimmunodepression, patients with immunodepression due to\nmedication, patients with infectious immunodepression (AIDS),\npatients with metabolic disorders (diabetes), and patients with\nrenal and hepatic insufficiency. Such patients would require\nantibiotic prophylaxis. 11, level III\nThe large multicentre trial of CDC\u2019s SENIC Project showed that\npatients with ASA (Appendix 2) scores of 1 and 2 had lower\ninfection rates than patients with ASA scores of 3 or more.", "chunk_order": 4}

(Grade B)\n2.2 Clean surgery\nThis category of surgery refers to surgical procedures in the\nmaxillofacial region in which the incision and exposure does\nnot extend into the oral cavity and includes submandibular and\nparotid gland surgery and TMJ surgery. Johnson et al. 12, level III reported a very low infection rate of 0.6%\nfor clean surgery in the head and neck region (parotidectomy,\nthyroidectomy, or submandibular gland excision) without the use\nof prophylactic antibiotics. The CDC\u2019s SENIC Project had a low infection rate of 1% for clean\ngeneral surgery cases with no other risk factors. 8, level II-2\nKnight et al.13, level III presented a very low infection rate of 0.2 %\nfor clean general surgery cases in which antibiotic prophylaxis\nwere not given. It is important to note that this infection rate was\nsimilar to that of clean general surgery cases in which antibiotic\nprophylaxis was given (0.94%). In an attempt to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics Liu et\nal.14, level II-3 demonstrated that with continuing medical education\n100% of the surgeons at their hospital stopped using prophylactic\nantibiotics for clean surgery. Chattopadhyayl et al.15, level III and Knight et al.13, level III showed\nthat clean surgery of long duration (> 75th percentile for similar\nprocedures / > 2 hours) is not associated with higher infection\nrates. Current evidence therefore indicates that clean surgery is\nassociated with low infection rates with or without antibiotics. RECOMMENDATION 2\n\u2022\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for clean surgery in\nhealthy patients. (Grade B)\n2.3 Clean-contaminated surgery\nThis category of surgery refers to surgical procedures in the oral\nand maxillofacial region limited to the oral cavity or which extends\ninto the oral cavity. In this category fall a wide range of procedures. They range from\nminor soft tissue and dentoalveolar surgery to surgery to place\ndental implants to major oral and maxillofacial surgery. 2.3.1 Minor clean\u2014contaminated surgery\n2.3.1.1 Lower third molar surgery\nVarious randomised controlled trials found that prophylactic\nantibiotics did not have a statistically significant effect on postoperative infections in third molar surgery and concluded that\nantibiotics should not be routinely administered when third molars\nare removed in healthy individuals.16-20, level 1\nA local retrospective study by Royan et al.21, level III also showed\nno difference in infection rates between patients who were given\nprophylactic antibiotics and those who were not.", "chunk_order": 5}

A large multicentre prospective Malaysian study showed that the\ninfection rate in healthy patients given a single dose of antibiotics\n(0.6%) was lower than that in patients not given antibiotics (2%)\nor in patients given five days of antibiotics post-operatively\n(2%). All the infections were also noted to be mild and easily\ntreated. The study concluded that the low infection rate and mild\ninfections in patients not given antibiotics did not justify the use\nof prophylactic antibiotics. The authors commented that it was\nnot justifiable to give antibiotics to 100 patients to prevent mild\ninfections in two of them.2, level II-2\nA Cochrane Review stated that there is some evidence that\nprophylactic antibiotics can reduce infection and dry sockets\nfollowing third molar extraction. The authors however concluded\nthat due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria which are\nresistant to treatment by currently available antibiotics, clinicians\nshould consider the fact that because the infection rate is low,\ngiving antibiotics is likely to do more harm than good. 10, level I\nThere is no evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in\nsurgery to remove other impacted teeth. However, an inference\ncan be made from the evidence for third molar surgery that the\nuse of prophylactic antibiotics would similarly not be beneficial. RECOMMENDATION 3\n\u2022\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for lower third molar\nsurgery. (Grade A)\n2.3.1.2 Periodontal Surgery\nThe incidence of infection after periodontal surgery is low\n(0.55% - 2.09%).22-23, level III A retrospective study by Callis et\nal.22, level III showed that patients who received antibiotics as\npart of the surgical protocol (pre- and/or post- surgery) had an\ninfection rate of 2.85% compared to an infection rate of 1.81%\nwhen no antibiotics were used. This result was not statistically\nsignificant.23, level III Here again, because of the low infection rate,\ngiving antibiotics is likely to do more harm than good. RECOMMENDATION 4\n\u2022\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for routine\nperiodontal surgery. (Grade B)\n2.3.1.3 Minor clean-contaminated surgery with high degree\nof difficulty / long duration\nClean contaminated surgery of long duration (> 75th percentile\nfor similar procedures) is associated with higher infection rates. 8,\nlevel II-2; 13, level III\nThis higher infection rate is to be expected as the deeper tissues of\nthe surgical site are exposed to the oral cavity for a longer period\nof time.", "chunk_order": 6}

(Grade B)\n2.3.1.3 Minor clean-contaminated surgery with high degree\nof difficulty / long duration\nClean contaminated surgery of long duration (> 75th percentile\nfor similar procedures) is associated with higher infection rates. 8,\nlevel II-2; 13, level III\nThis higher infection rate is to be expected as the deeper tissues of\nthe surgical site are exposed to the oral cavity for a longer period\nof time. Also, surgery with a higher degree of difficulty causes\nmore injury to the tissues resulting in compromised healing and\nimmune responses. RECOMMENDATION 5\n\u2022\nAntibiotic prophylaxis may be indicated for minor surgery\nwith a high degree of difficulty in which the duration of the\nsurgery is predicted to be long. (Grade B)\n2.3.1.4 Surgery to place dental implants\nDespite the high success rates published in the literature, implant\nfailures do occur. Some of the early dental implant losses could\nbe due to bacterial contamination during implant insertion which\nmay lead to infections around the implant. Such infections when\nthey do occur are very difficult to manage. The financial loss of\nimplant failure is also great. In order to minimize early infection\nafter dental implant placement, systemic antibiotic prophylaxis\nregimes have been advocated. Two recent Cochrane systematic reviews concluded that there is\nsome evidence suggesting 2g of amoxicillin given orally 1 hour\npreoperatively significantly reduces failures of dental implants\nplaced in ordinary conditions.24-25, level 1\nRECOMMENDATION 6\n\u2022\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for surgery to place\ndental implants. (Grade A)\n2.3.1.5 Surgery associated with the use of bone grafts\nThere is a paucity of evidence on whether antibiotic prophylaxis\nis indicated when bone grafts are inserted intra-orally. The reason\nfor this lack of evidence is probably due to the fact that surgeons\nconsider the financial cost and morbidity too great if a bone graft\nis lost through infection and therefore prescribe antibiotics. A search of the literature found only one randomized controlled\ndouble blind study. The results of this study showed there was a\nstatistically significant increased risk of having an infection after\nan intra-oral bone grafting procedure when antibiotic prophylaxis\nwas not used. 26, level 1\nRECOMMENDATION 7\n\u2022\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for minor oral surgical\nprocedures in which a bone graft is inserted. (Grade A)\n2.3.2 Major clean-contaminated surgery\nOrthognathic surgery is the archetype of major clean contaminated\nmaxillofacial surgery. This category of surgery also includes\nsurgery for large benign tumours and cysts. In major maxillofacial surgery, the duration of the surgery is\nexpected to be long with the wound open into the mouth for the\nduration of the surgery. As discussed above in Section 2.3.1.3,\nclean-contaminated surgery of longer duration is associated with\nan increased incidence of SSI. 8, level II-2; 13, level III\nUsing proper surgical techniques and prophylactic antibiotics,\nPeterson 27, level III stated that it was possible to reduce infection\nrates to as low as 1.0%.

RECOMMENDATION 8\n\u2022\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for major clean\ncontaminated maxillofacial surgery. (Grade A)\n2.4 Cancer surgery\nPatients with head and neck cancer are usually older and are often\nmedically compromised. Simo and French 30, level III advocated the\nuse of prophylactic antibiotics for clean surgery associated with\nmalignancy as it has a significantly higher infection rate when\ncompared to surgery for benign disease. A prospective controlled\nstudy on antibiotic prophylaxis in clean neck dissections done by\nSeven et al. 31, level II-1 showed a significantly higher incidence of\ninfections in patients who were not given antibiotics. In clean-contaminated cancer surgery of the head and neck\ninvolving major resections and flap reconstruction, Hirakawa et\nal.32, level II-3 showed an infection rate 32% and Skitarelic et al.33,\nlevel II-3 found an infection rate of 22.0% even with prophylactic\nantibiotics.

(Grade B)\n\u2022\nAntibiotics should not be continued postoperatively. (Grade B)\n2.6 Site of surgery involving bone previously exposed to\nradiotherapy\nPatients who have had radiation for the treatment of head and\nneck malignancy are at risk of osteoradionecrosis following oral\nsurgical intervention to the jaws. While osteoradionecrosis itself\nis not considered an infection, surgical site infection involving the\nbone can cause osteoradionecrosis by means of inflammatory\nand infectious insult to the compromised bone. As a result of\nthe morbidity associated with osteoradionecrosis, antibiotics\nhave been widely used peri-operatively in association with\nsurgery involving bone to try and prevent the occurrence of\nosteoradionecrosis. No randomized controlled trial has been conducted to determine\nif prophylactic antibiotics are effective in preventing the onset\nof osteoradionecrosis. In one systematic review 38, level II-3 the\nincidence of osteoradionecrosis following tooth extraction was\nslightly lower when prophylactic antibiotic was used as compared\nto when no antibiotics was used (6% vs. 7%). The conclusions\nof this systematic review were, however, derived from weak\nevidence consisting mainly of retrospective and non-randomised\nprospective studies. Prophylactic antibiotics therefore do not\nappear to be effective in preventing osteoradionecrosis. There is no difference in the incidence of osteoradionecrosis\nfollowing tooth extraction whether antibiotics are administered\nor not. If osteoradionecrosis does occur, there appears to be a changing\ntrend in its management. There is evidence of the effectiveness\nof conservative medical management incorporating antioxidant\ntherapy (Pentoxyphyline and Tocopherol).39, level III The addition of\nlow dose doxycycline or biphophonates to this also shows some\npromise.40, level III\n3.0 ADMINISTRATION OF PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS\nOnce it has been decided that prophylactic antibiotics are\nindicated, Peterson 27, level III has suggested that several principles\nbe followed:\n\u2022 The correct antibiotic must be used. \u2022 The plasma antibiotic level must be high. \u2022 The timing of administration must be correct. \u2022 The shortest antibiotic exposure must be used. 3.1 Choice of antibiotic\n3.1.1 Surgery confined to the oral cavity\nOne of the principles followed in choosing antibiotics is their\neffectiveness against the likely organisms causing the infection.

Following this principle alone, the choice of antibiotics for\nodontogenic infections becomes complicated due to the\npolymicrobial nature of these infections. The bacteria involved in odontogenic infections include the\nfacultative anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (Streptococcus\nviridans), the strict anaerobic Gram-negative rods (Porphyromona,\nPrevotella and Fusobacterium spp.) and the strict anaerobic\nGram-positive cocci (Peptostreptococcus spp.)41, level III; 42, level II-1\nThere is agreement that facultative and strict anaerobes act\nsynergistically and not in isolation in causing infection.41, level III;\n42, level II-1; 43, level II-3 Gaetti-Jardim et al.43, level II-3 went on to suggest\nthat it may be sufficient just to break the established synergism\nbetween different bacteria, rather than to try and target every\nsingle potential organism that may be involved in the infection. Yuvaraj et al.42, level II-1 showed that in interdependent, synergistic\nmixed infections, one bacterial species sensitive to penicillin may\nrender the entire pathogenic complex non-pathogenic. Penicillin and amoxicillin are effective against the organisms\ncausing odontogenic infections and penicillin is still regarded by\nmany authorities as the drug of choice. 42, level II-1; 44, level II-3; 45, level II-3;\n46, level 1\nThere is emerging resistance to penicillin by the Streptococcus\nviridans group due to modifications of the penicillin binding\nproteins (PBP). This resistance however can be overcome\nby increasing the dose of the antibiotic. The resistance of the\nanaerobic gram negative rods to penicillin is however due to the\nproduction of beta lactamase. As a result of this, the use of the\namoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination is becoming increasingly\npopular. 41, level III\nThe amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination is a broad spectrum\nantibiotic. It should be avoided when other more narrow-spectrum\nantibiotics could be used. It increases the risk of Clostridium\ndifficile, MRSA and other resistant infections.47, level I This antibiotic\nshould therefore be prescribed only for appropriate indications\nso that it remains an effective antibiotic when needed. Clindamycin has been shown to be effective against the facultative\nand strict anaerobes involved in odontogenic infections and is\ntherefore often the drug of choice in patients allergic to penicillin. 43, level II-3\nThe choice of antibiotic however must be justified by the\nantibiotic susceptibility patterns in the population. Table 1\nrepresents the antibiotic resistance patterns of oral organisms\nisolated in Hospital Sungai Buloh for 2014. The results show that\nStreptococcus viridans is still very sensitive to penicillin G and\nclindamycin but resistant to ampicillin. It also appears that the\nanaerobic organisms are showing some resistance to penicillin G\nand clindamycin. Table 1.

It is important to emphasize that the appropriate use of antibiotics\nin patient care is of paramount importance and that antibiotic\nprophylaxis in surgery is an adjunct to and not a substitute\nfor good surgical technique. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be\nregarded as one component of an effective policy for control of\nsurgical site infection. 5.0 IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe first edition of these clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on\nantibiotic prophylaxis against wound infection for oral surgical\nprocedures was developed and published in 2003.

An audit\ncarried out in 2010 however found that more than half of the\nrespondents did not use the CPG. 1, level III It also found that the\nmost important sources of information that clinicians used were\ntheir own clinical experience and the opinions of their colleagues. A study done in 2012 by the IHSR 2, level III found a wide variation in\nthe use of antibiotics by doctors for patients undergoing dentoalveolar surgery. At the start of the study it was discovered that\ndoctors followed 3 patterns of prescribing, either i) they did not\nprescribe any antibiotics, ii) prescribed only a single dose of\nantibiotic pre-operatively or iii) prescribed 5 days of antibiotics\npost-operatively. For the doctors who prescribed antibiotics\npost-operatively, 77% prescribed one antibiotic while the rest\nprescribed two. There was also a wide range of the types of\nantibiotics prescribed which included amoxicillin, bacampicillin,\nco-amoxiclav, metronidazole, cloxacillin and cefuroxime. It is important to ensure that the use of prophylactic antibiotics\nin oral surgery is evidence-based. The rational use of antibiotics\nby all healthcare professionals will help to prevent the emergence\nof resistant organisms. Appropriate antibiotic use will assist in\nsuccessful treatment outcomes and reduce adverse reactions.

Existing barriers for application of the recommendations of the\nCPG include:\na) Non-standard teaching related to prophylactic antibiotic use\nb) Variation in treatment practice and preferences\n5.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:\na) Ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to healthcare\nprofessionals. b) Reinforce training of healthcare professionals to ensure\ninformation is up to date.
