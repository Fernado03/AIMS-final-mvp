Screening\n\u2022 Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus based on risk factors\nusing 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be done at\nbooking. \uf0a1 If the test is negative, it should be repeated at 24-28 weeks of\ngestation. \u2022 For women at the age of 25 or more with no other risk factors, OGTT\nshould be done at 24-28 weeks of gestation. \u2022 Overt diabetes in pregnancy should be managed as pre-existing\ndiabetes. Preconception Care\n\u2022 Preconception care of women with pre-existing diabetes which\ninvolve a multidisciplinary team should be fully implemented in all\nhealthcare facilities. Antenatal Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\n\u2022 Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be done in diabetes\nin pregnancy. The blood glucose targets should be as the following:\n\uf0a1 fasting or preprandial: \u22645.3 mmol/L\n\uf0a1 1-hour postprandial: \u22647.8 mmol/L\n\uf0a1 2-hour postprandial: \u22646.7 mmol/L\n\u2022 The frequency of SMBG in diabetes in pregnancy should be\nindividualised based on mode of treatment and glycaemic control. \u2022 Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes on multiple daily insulin\n(MDI) injection regimen should perform SMBG at least three times\ndaily. It can be done at fasting, preprandial, postprandial or bedtime. \u2022 Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on MDI injection\nregimen should perform SMBG two to three times daily, for two to\nthree days a week. \u2022 Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes mellitus or GDM on diet and exercise\ntherapy, oral antidiabetic agents (OAD), single-dose intermediate-acting\nor long-acting insulin should perform fasting and postprandial SMBG at\nleast once daily until blood glucose targets are reached. \u2022 Pregnant women who are on insulin or OAD should maintain their\ncapillary blood glucose level >4.0 mmol/L. Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\niii\n\u2022 Pregnant women with diabetes should be given individualised\nmedical nutrition therapy which includes carbohydrate-controlled\nmeal plan and monitoring of gestational weight gain. \u2022 In gestational diabetes mellitus, metformin should be offered when\nblood glucose targets are not met using changes in diet and exercise\nwithin 1-2 weeks. \uf0a1 It should be prescribed after consultation with specialists. \u2022 Metformin should be continued in women who are already on the\ntreatment before pregnancy. \u2022 Insulin therapy can be initiated at outpatient setting in pregnant\nwomen with diabetes. \u2022 The preferred choice of insulin regime in diabetes in pregnancy is\nmultiple daily injections. \u2022 Insulin analogues should be continued during pregnancy in women\nwith pre-existing diabetes who are already on the treatment and\nhave established good blood glucose control before pregnancy.", "chunk_order": 2}

Intrapartum Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\n\u2022 In women with diabetes, capillary blood glucose should be maintained\nbetween 4.0-7.0 mmol/L during labour and delivery. Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\niv\nPostpartum Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\n\u2022 In women with history of gestational diabetes mellitus, oral glucose\ntolerance test should be performed at six weeks after delivery to\ndetect diabetes and prediabetes. If negative, annual screening\nshould be performed. Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\nv\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT AND OBJECTIVES\nGUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for these CPG were\nfrom the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Higher Education\n(MoHE). There was active involvement of a multidisciplinary Review\nCommittee (RC) during the process of the CPG development. A systematic literature search was carried out using the following\nelectronic databases/platform: Guidelines International Network (G-I-N),\nMedline via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR)\nand Pubmed. Refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search Strategy. The inclusion criteria were all diabetes in pregnancy regardless of\nstudy design. The search was limited to literature published in the last\n10 years, on humans and in English. In addition, the reference lists of\nall retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in the\nfield contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted\nfrom 3 October 2015 to 21 March 2016. Literature search was repeated\nfor all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process\nallowing any relevant papers published before 30 June 2017 to be\nincluded. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after\nthis cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained\nupon request from the CPG Secretariat.", "chunk_order": 3}

A total of 13 clinical questions were developed under different sections. Members of the DG were assigned individual questions within\nthese sections. Refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions. The\nDG members met 22 times throughout the development of these\nguidelines. All literatures retrieved were appraised by at least two DG\nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented\nin evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All\nstatements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed\nupon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were made by consensus of the DG and RC. Any\nManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy\ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was\nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and\nclinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration. The literatures used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001)\nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of\nGRADE (refer to the preceding page). The writing of the CPG follows\nstrictly the requirement of AGREE II. On completion, the draft CPG was reviewed by external reviewers. It\nwas also posted on the MoH Malaysia official website for feedback from\nany interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical\nAdvisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MoH\nMalaysia for review and approval.

INTRODUCTION\nThe National Health Morbidity Survey 2015 showed that the prevalence\nof diabetes was 17.5%. Generally, the prevalence of diabetes increases\nwith age.1, level III This is a concern especially in the reproductive age\ngroup as this will adversely affect their fertility and pregnancy. Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with risks to the woman and her\ndeveloping fetus. National Obstetric Report involving 14 tertiary hospitals\nshowed the incidence of diabetes in pregnancy was 8.66% in 2011 and\n8.83% in 2012. The caesarean section rates in this group of patients\nwere around 13% in 2011 and 2012. In both years approximately 16%\nbabies born to diabetic mothers weighed 4 kg and more. There was\na 2-fold increase in macrosomia in diabetes patients in both years\nas compared to nondiabetes and this could have contributed to the\nincreased caesarean section rates. These figures were obtained from\nonly a few tertiary hospitals and the actual prevalence was expected to\nbe higher.2, level III\nThere are variations in local clinical practice management of diabetes\nin pregnancy at different levels of care. To date, there is no specific\nlocal CPG addressing this issue. This CPG, therefore, provides\na comprehensive evidence-based guideline in screening and\nmanagement of diabetes and its complications in pregnancy. This CPG\nwould assist healthcare providers in delivering high quality care. 2. SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS\nScreening for diabetes in pregnant women is important to identify\nasymptomatic patients who may have overt diabetes before they\nmanifest symptoms such as excessive thirst and urination, or fatigue. Two main screening strategies are \u2018universal\u2019 where all women undergo\na screening test for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and \u2018selective\u2019\nwhere only those women at high risk are screened. In a Cochrane systematic review, there was insufficient evidence to\ndetermine if screening for GDM and types of screening can improve\nmaternal and fetal health outcome in view of small studies and poor\nquality evidences. However, one of the included study showed that\nuniversal screening was better than selective screening at detecting\nGDM (RR=0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75).3, level I\nIdeally, universal screening should be adhered to.", "chunk_order": 8}

Based on consensus between RC and DG CPG, pregnant\nwomen \u226525 years old without other risk factors should have screening\nfor GDM at 24-28 weeks. Another Cochrane systematic review found that the evidence was\ninsufficient to conclude the best strategy to diagnose GDM.5, level I\nHowever, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) has been recommended\nby international guidelines on the issue.6, 7-8, level III It should be done at\nbooking for high risk women, and repeated at 24-28 weeks of gestation\nif the initial result was negative4, 6\nThere is insufficient evidence to suggest HbA1c alone as a useful\ndiagnostic test for GDM and thus, it is not a useful alternative to\nOGTT.9, level III\nIn a meta-analysis on screening for GDM, random blood sugar\nmeasurement was found to be an inadequate test to screen for GDM. 10, level II-2\n2.1 OVERT DIABETES IN PREGNANCY\nThere is no universally accepted definition of overt diabetes in\npregnancy.

Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\n3. MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANT WOMEN AT RISK OF\nDEVELOPING GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS\nThere are many adverse effects of obesity on maternal and perinatal\noutcomes. Obesity in pregnancy is associated with a significant risk of\nGDM and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including pre-eclampsia. Caesarean section rates are high and infants of obese mothers\nare at greater risk of large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia,\nshoulder dystocia, congenital malformation and stillbirth. Thus, lifestyle\nmodification strategies such as exercise, diet and weight management\nare important to prevent GDM. 3.1 MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY\nMedical nutrition therapy (MNT) consists of nutritional diagnosis and\ntherapy that include dietary intervention and counselling. It is crucial at\nany stage of pregnancy in women who are at risk of GDM. This can be\nachieved by choosing healthy food with appropriate gestational weight\ngain (GWG).14, level III\nWomen at risks of GDM should receive individualised MNT as needed,\npreferably by a dietitian. A small group counselling (2-4 women) may\nalso be provided. A nonrandomised trial has shown that small group\ncounselling produced similar improvement in nutrition knowledge\ncompared to individual counselling.15, level II-2\nIn a meta-analysis of RCTs among pregnant women (mostly with BMI\n>25 kg/m2), combined dietary intervention and physical activity reduced\nthe risk of GDM by 18% (p=0.0091) compared with standard care.", "chunk_order": 10}

However, no significant difference was observed between\ndifferent types of dietary intervention to prevent GDM. There were no\nadverse events reported in all of the included studies.17, level I\nGWG rate which is higher than the recommended range especially\nin early pregnancy may increase the risk of GDM. Excessive GWG\nincreases the risk of postpartum weight retention and maternal obesity\nlater in life.

However, targeting\nGWG to the lower range in Table 1 may be recommended to improve\npregnancy outcomes. GWG is the major determinant of incremental energy needs during\npregnancy. Energy prescription should be individualised based on\npre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain, fetal growth pattern, physical activity,\nfood and blood glucose records. \u2022 For women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI, energy prescriptions\n(approximately ranges from 30-35 kcal/kg body weight depending on\nactivity level) should be given as per normal pregnancy based on the\nRecommended Nutrient Intakes for Malaysia.4\n\u2022 For obese women, a 30-33% of calorie restriction of their estimated\nenergy needs (approximately 25 kcal/kg body weight) can be\nprescribed to reduce the rate of GWG without inducing maternal\nketosis and compromising fetal growth or birth weight.

The aim is to achieve and maintain\noptimum glycaemic levels and appropriate GWG, while meeting\nessential nutrients to promote positive maternal and fetal outcomes.4\nEvidence on the ideal amount of CHO for pregnant women with diabetes\nto achieve good glycaemic control is limited, but a minimum of 175 g\nCHO daily has been recommended.37, level III In a meta-analysis of RCTs\non GDM, lower CHO diets [40-45% of total energy intake (TEI)] showed\nno significant difference in maternal and neonatal outcomes compared\nwith CHO intake of 55-60% TEI. This could be due to the small number\nof studies included.38, level I\nThe ideal macronutrients distribution for pregnant women with diabetes\nis not known. Macronutrient distribution should be individualised. A\ngeneral recommendation to promote a balance diet would be 45-60%\nCHO, 15-20% protein and 25-35% fat of total energy requirement.4\nBoth the amount and type of CHO influence glycaemic control. The type\nof CHO is best described using glycaemic index (GI) concept.

Recommendation 7\n\u2022 In gestational diabetes mellitus, metformin should be offered when\nblood glucose targets are not met by modification in diet and exercise\nwithin 1-2 weeks. \uf0a1 It should be prescribed after consultation with specialists. \u2022 Metformin should be continued in women who are already on the\ntreatment before pregnancy. 5.4 INSULIN\n5.4.1\nInitiating Insulin Therapy\nCommon current practice involves hospital admissions for initiation\nof insulin therapy in insulin-na\u00efve pregnant women and GDM. There\nis no evidence to support inpatient or outpatient settings for more\neffective treatment. However, local expert opinion recommends that\ninsulin therapy could be initiated in the outpatient setting if the patient\nis agreeable, able to equip herself with adequate SMBG and able to\ntitrate the required insulin doses to achieve glycaemic targets without\nhypoglycaemia. This may provide a more practical real-life experience\nin the comfort of her home as she attempts to make the necessary diet\nand lifestyle changes. However, specialists may opt for hospital admission if deemed necessary\ndue to logistic reasons, the need for referral to other multidisciplinary\nteams, closer monitoring for hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and\nother factors. Insulin should be initiated when MNT and/or metformin therapy failed to\nachieve optimum glycaemic control. There are multiple insulin regimes\navailable in managing diabetes in pregnancy. However, the preferred\nchoice of insulin regime is MDI.4 Initiation and optimisation of insulin\ntherapy is illustrated in Appendix 4.

Adequate glucose\nmust be provided during labour to meet its high requirement.33, level III\nA small RCT among pregnant women with diabetes requiring insulin,\ntitrated insulin infusion versus alternating intravenous fluid regime\nwith insulin as needed showed no difference in intrapartum maternal\nglycaemic control and neonatal hypoglycaemia.69, level I There is no\nother evidence on the optimal method of maintaining glycaemic control\nduring delivery. Current recommendations for intrapartum glycaemic control are:6; 33, level III\n\u2022 monitor CBG every hour during labour and delivery, and ensure that\nit is maintained at 4.0-7.0 mmol/L\n\u2022 use IV dextrose and insulin for women with\n\uf0a1 T1DM from the onset of established labour\n\uf0a1 CBG >7.0 mmol/L\nFor intrapartum glycaemic management in women with pre-existing\ndiabetes and GDM, refer to Algorithm B and C. Recommendation 13\n\u2022 In women with diabetes, capillary blood glucose should be\nmaintained at 4.0-7.0 mmol/L during labour and delivery. \u2022 Monitoring of capillary blood glucose during labour and delivery in\nwomen with diabetes should be done:\n\uf0a1 1- to 2-hourly in women on insulin treatment\n\uf0a1 4-hourly in women not on insulin treatment\nManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy\n7. POSTPARTUM MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES IN PREGNANCY\nPostpartum management is important in both GDM and pre-existing\ndiabetes. This section covers aspects in glucose monitoring, diabetes\nprevention, pharmacotherapy, contraception, breastfeeding and lifestyle\nmodification in the postnatal period. 7.1 POSTPARTUM GLUCOSE MONITORING\n\u2022 Women with insulin-treated pre-existing diabetes should reduce\ntheir insulin immediately after birth and monitor their blood glucose\nlevels carefully to establish the appropriate dose.6\n\u2022 Most women diagnosed with GDM should be able to discontinue\ntheir insulin immediately after delivery.4\n\u2022 Explain to women with insulin-treated pre-existing diabetes that\nthey are at increased risk of hypoglycaemia in the postnatal period,\nespecially when breastfeeding, and advise them to have a meal or\nsnack available before or during feeds.6\nIn women with history of GDM,\n\u2022 postpartum 75 g OGTT within one year of delivery yields higher\ndetection rate of diabetes and pre-diabetes compared with FPG\nalone.70, level III\n\u2022 FPG (\u22656.1 mmol/L) has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 91%\nfor detection of diabetes.", "chunk_order": 24}

Breastfeeding\nfor at least three months is recommended and longer duration is\nencouraged to reduce the risk of diabetes. 7.4 POSTPARTUM CONTRACEPTION\nIn pre-existing diabetes, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate\nany significant difference in contraceptive efficacy and diabetes control\nbetween hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptions.80, level I\nThere is limited data to demonstrate that Levonorgestrel-intrauterine\nsystem does not negatively affect glucose tolerance, i.e. IFG and IGT,\ncompared with copper intrauterine device or tubal sterilisation in women\nwith history of GDM.81, level III\n7.5 POSTPARTUM LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION\nPostpartum lifestyle intervention includes MNT, physical activity and\nbehavioural modification. It has been shown to be effective in reducing\nweight and insulin resistance, and development of T2DM among\nwomen with history of GDM.82, level I\nIntensive lifestyle intervention (addition of moderate physical activity,\n50-60 minutes, four days per week) is effective in reducing cumulative\nincidence of diabetes during a 3-year study compared with conventional\ncare (p=0.003).83, level I It is also effective in reducing postpartum weight\nretention, waist circumference, insulin resistance, LDL-cholesterol\nand triglycerides, and increase intensity of vigorous physical activity\nlevel.83-84, level I\nPostpartum weight loss of more than 2 kg is significantly associated\nwith smaller increase in FPG and reduction in 2-hour glucose levels\npost glucose challenge.85, level I\nIn an RCT, intensive lifestyle intervention delivered via educational\nprogramme showed no significant differences in waist circumference,\nfasting blood glucose and lipids.", "chunk_order": 25}

MANAGEMENT OF NEONATES OF MOTHERS WITH DIABETES\nOptimal glycaemic control during pregnancy reduces the incidence of\nperinatal morbidity and mortality. Recognised neonatal complications\nof mothers with diabetes include macrosomia, traumatic birth injuries,\nneonatal hypoglycaemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Women with diabetes\nshould deliver in hospitals where neonatal resuscitation services are\navailable. Management of neonates of mothers with diabetes are listed below:6\n\u2022 The neonates should stay with their mothers unless there are clinical\ncomplications or signs that warrant admission for special or intensive\ncare. \u2022 Perform blood glucose testing routinely in neonates at 2-4 hours after\nbirth to detect hypoglycaemia. Perform blood tests for polycythaemia,\nhyperbilirubinaemia, hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia if\nclinical signs present. \u2022 Only discharge neonates after 24 hours of delivery, provided that\nthey are maintaining satisfactory CBG levels and feeding well. Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\n9. MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL CONDITIONS IN DIABETES IN\nPREGNANCY\n9.1 CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION\nInsulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)\nis a small device that is used to administer subcutaneous insulin\ncontinuously. It has been used in non-pregnant diabetes patients\nespecially in T1DM. In a Cochrane systematic review, there is no evidence to support the\nuse of CSII over multiple doses insulin for pregnant women with preexisting diabetes and GDM. The RCTs used in the review were small\nand of low quality.87, level I\n\u2022 CSII does not confer additional maternal or fetal benefits compared\nwith MDI. However, those who are already using the device can\ncontinue it throughout pregnancy. 9.2 CORTICOSTEROIDS\nCorticosteroids are administered during pregnancy to accelerate fetal\nlung maturation. It is known to elevate plasma glucose levels and\nworsen glycaemic control of diabetes in pregnancy. In two observational studies, both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose\nwere elevated after corticosteroids administration in pregnant women with\ndiabetes.88-89, level III Most of them had to increase the insulin doses to less\nthan double of their regular doses.88, level III\nThere is no evidence on the use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids for\nother indications in diabetes with pregnancy. \u2022 Women with diabetes who are given corticosteroids during\npregnancy need regular plasma glucose monitoring (at least four\ntimes a day, for 48 hours from the first dose) and adjustment of their\ninsulin dose accordingly. 9.3 FASTING\nPregnant women with diabetes should be strongly advised against\nfasting during Ramadhan.", "chunk_order": 26}

However, some of them might wish to\nobserve the religious obligation.90\nIn a local study on pregnant women with diabetes who fasted during\nRamadhan, most of them who were on NPH insulin (79.2%) were\nable to fast for more than 15 days without any hypoglycaemia or\nManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy\nfetal complications. Thus, once or twice daily NPH insulin is safe and\ntolerable for this group of pregnant women.91, level III\nWomen with pre-existing diabetes and GDM with good glycaemic\ncontrol prior to Ramadhan continue to have good control throughout\nand after Ramadhan.92, level II-2\nRecommendation 15\n\u2022 Pregnant diabetes women should consult their healthcare providers\nif they wish to observe fasting. 10. REFERRAL TO SECONDARY/TERTIARY CARE\nAll women with pre-existing diabetes should receive continuous\nspecialist care to detect complications, review medications and optimise\nglycaemic control.33, level III Similarly, women with GDM who have poor\nglycaemic control and fetal complications should receive specialist\ncare. Referral to a dietitian is necessary to ensure balanced diet and\nachievement of good glycaemic control. Assessment for retinopathy\nand nephropathy should be performed regularly during pregnancy.6\nAt postpartum, these women should be referred back to their health\nfacilities to continue with their diabetes care. Ophthalmology review\nshould be performed at least six months after delivery.6\nRecommendation 16\n\u2022 Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes and women with GDM\nwho have poor glycaemic control or fetal complications should be\nreferred to secondary or tertiary care. Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy\n11. IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nImplementation of CPG is important as it helps in providing quality\nhealthcare services based on best available evidence applied to local\nscenario and expertise. Various factors and resource implications\nshould be considered for the success of the uptake in the CPG\nrecommendations. 11.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nThe existing facilitating factors in implementing the recommendations\nin the CPG are:\n\u2022 availability of CPG to healthcare providers (hardcopies and\nsoftcopies)\n\u2022 regular conferences and updates on management of diabetes in\npregnancy involving professional societies or bodies (Malaysian\nEndocrine and Metabolic Society, Obstetrics and Gynaecology\nSociety of Malaysia, Family Medicine Specialist Association, Academy\nof Family Physician Malaysia, National Diabetes Institute, etc.)\n\u2022 public awareness campaigns on diabetes in pregnancy during World\nDiabetes Day, etc.", "chunk_order": 27}

Insulin is administered\nintravenously at a variable rate. CBG is checked hourly and insulin\ninfusion rate adjusted accordingly to maintain target CBG range. Women with T1DM need to have some insulin in their system at all\ntimes to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis. Those with T2DM or GDM may\nor may not require insulin infusion. Insulin requirements decrease after\ndelivery of the placenta. Intravenous insulin infusion protocol\nDilute insulin to a concentration of 1 unit/mL. Use either 20 units shortacting human insulin (actrapid) made up to 20 mL with 0.9% saline\nsolution in a 20 mL syringe or 50 units short-acting human insulin made\nup to 50 mL with 0.9% saline solution in a 50 mL syringe. Administer\ninsulin infusion via a syringe pump. Based on serum potassium (K+) result, prepare a separate dextrosepotassium chloride (KCl) mixture as below:\nNote: One ampoule of 10 mL KCl 10% contains 13.4 mmol of K+. \u2022 Initiate IV insulin infusion as detailed in Algorithm C. \u2022 Maintain a constant infusion of dextrose-KCl over six hours, at a rate\nof 83 mL/hour. \u2022 The patient would require one dedicated IV cannula with both\ninfusions administered concurrently through infusion pumps,\nconnected via a 3-way stopcock to the IV cannula.", "chunk_order": 41}
