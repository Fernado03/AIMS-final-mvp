Adherence to these guidelines may not necessarily guarantee the best outcome in every case. Every healthcare provider is\nresponsible for the management of his/her unique patient based on the\nclinical picture presented by the patient and the management options\navailable locally. Management of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\nUPDATING THE CPG\nThese guidelines were issued in 2019 and will be reviewed in a minimum period of four years (2023) or sooner if new evidence becomes\navailable. When it is due for updating, the Chairman of the CPG or\nNational Advisor of the related specialty will be informed about it. A\ndiscussion will be done on the need for a revision including the scope\nof the revised CPG. A multidisciplinary team will be formed and the latest systematic review methodology used by MaHTAS will be employed. Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every\ndetail at the time of publication.

ASSESSMENT\n\u2022 The severity of major depressive disorder should be assessed to\ndetermine the mode of treatment. TREATMENT\nPSYCHOEDUCATION\n\u2022 Psychoeducation should be offered early and continuously\nthroughout the management of major depressive disorder. ACUTE PHASE\n\u2022 MILD TO MODERATE\n\u2022 In mild to moderate major depressive disorder, psychosocial\nintervention and psychotherapy should be offered, based on resource\navailability, but not restricted to the following:\n\uf0a1 cognitive behavioural therapy\n\uf0a1 interpersonal therapy\n\uf0a1 problem-solving therapy\n\uf0a1 behavioural therapy\n\uf0a1 internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy\n\u2022 MODERATE TO SEVERE\n\u2022 In moderate to severe major depressive disorder, a combination of\npharmacotherapy and psychotherapy should be offered. \u2022 In moderate to severe major depressive disorder, exercise may be\noffered as an adjunct treatment. Management of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\n\u2022 In moderate to severe major depressive disorder, one of the secondgeneration antidepressants should be prescribed:\n\uf0a1 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n\uf0a1 serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors\n\uf0a1 noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants\n\uf0a1 melatonergic agonist and serotonergic antagonist\n\uf0a1 multimodal serotonin modulator\n\uf0a1 noradrenaline/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor\nMAINTENANCE AND CONTINUATION PHASE\n\u2022 Antidepressants should be continued for at least six to nine months\nafter remission, and at least two years if there is a high risk of relapse\nor recurrence. MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WITH PSYCHOSIS\n\u2022 Combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic should be\nconsidered in major depressive disorder with psychotic features. FAILED RESPONSE TO INITIAL TREATMENT\n\u2022 Optimisation of antidepressant should be considered in patients who\nfail to show response to initial treatment in major depressive disorder.", "chunk_order": 2}

TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION\n\u2022 In treatment-resistant depression, the following strategies may be\nconsidered:\n\uf0a1 switching antidepressants to a different class\n\uf0a1 combination of antidepressants\n\uf0a1 augmentation with atypical antipsychotics, lithium or antiepileptic\nagents\nManagement of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\nPHYSICAL TREATMENT\n\u2022 Electroconvulsive therapy may be considered in major depressive\ndisorder with:\n\uf0a1 life-threatening conditions e.g. refusal to eat and high suicidality\n\uf0a1 moderate to severe symptoms for rapid improvement in the acute\ntreatment\n\uf0a1 treatment-resistant depression\nCOLLABORATIVE CARE\n\u2022 Collaborative care may be considered in acute and continuation\nphase treatment of major depressive disorder. MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IN PERINATAL WOMEN\n\u2022 Screening for perinatal depression may be done in a two-stage\napproach. \uf0a1 Use brief screening tools e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire-2 or\nWhooley Questions in the first stage. \uf0a1 If there is positive response to the brief screening tools, Edinburgh\nPostnatal Depression Scale should be used for further screening\n\u2022 For mild to moderate perinatal depression, psychotherapy, e.g. interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy,\nshould be considered as initial treatment. \u2022 Psychosocial interventions, i.e. peer support and non-directive\ncounselling, may be considered in mild to moderate postpartum\ndepression. \u2022 For severe perinatal depression, pharmacotherapy should be\nconsidered and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the\npreferred choice. Once medications have become effective,\npsychotherapy may be offered as an adjunct. MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IN THE ELDERLY\n\u2022 Antidepressants should be considered with caution on tolerability\nissues for major depressive disorder in the elderly. \u2022 Psychotherapy should be offered for major depressive disorder in\nthe elderly. \u2022 Electroconvulsive therapy may be offered in elderly with major\ndepressive disorder after assessment of possible co-morbidities. Management of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\nMAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC\nMEDICAL ILLNESS\n\u2022 Screening for depression should be done in patients with chronic\nmedical illness (CMI) with related functional impairment. \u2022 Psychosocial intervention and psychotherapy should be considered\nin patients with major depressive disorder and CMI. \u2022 If pharmacotherapy is required for patients with major depressive\ndisorder and CMI, consider antidepressants with the least drug-drug\ninteractions.

The inclusion criteria are all adult patients with major\ndepressive disorder (MDD) regardless of study design. The search\nwas limited to literature published from 2006 and on humans and in\nEnglish. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and\nguidelines were searched further to look for relevant studies. Experts in\nthe field were also contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches\nwere conducted from 6 March 2016 to 15 August 2018. Literature\nsearches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG\ndevelopment process allowing any relevant papers published before\n22 February 2019 to be included.

INTRODUCTION\nMental health is a state of well-being in which every individual realises\nhis or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can\nwork productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to the\ncommunity.1 It includes emotional, psychological and social well-being. However, unhealthy mental health can lead someone to develop mental\ndisorder including MDD. Mental disorder is defined as \u201ca syndrome\ncharacterised by clinically significant disturbance in an individual\u2019s\ncognition, emotion regulation or behaviour that reflects a dysfunction\nin the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying\nmental functioning\u201d.2\nMDD, a common but complex illness, can present with a variety of\nunique symptom combinations. This disorder is characterised by\npersistent low mood, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, sleep\ndisturbances, fatigue and in more severe form, functional impairment\nand suicidal ideations. Functional impairment is defined as loss of\nfunctional capacity affecting a person\u2019s ability to work resulting from the\nperson\u2019s medical condition.3\nIt is estimated that MDD will contribute to highest burden of disease in\n2030.4 The adverse outcomes related to MDD varies from significant\ndifficulties in role transitions, decreased role functioning, increased\nrisk of onset, severity and persistence of several secondary disorders.", "chunk_order": 8}

There is higher risk of early mortality resulting from physical disorders\nand suicide.5, level III The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that\nsuicide is the second leading cause of death among the 15 to 29 years\nage group.6\nA review of depression studies in Malaysia showed the prevalence of\nMDD in Malaysia to be between 8 - 12%.7, level III A meta-analysis showed\na global prevalence of MDD at 4.7% (95% CI 4.4 to 5.0%).8, level III\nA systematic review of 27 studies showed that MDD (especially in\nspecialised mental health care) often has a chronic and/or recurrent\ncourse with consequences over the entire lifespan.9, level III WHO Global\nHealth Estimates 2015 found that depressive disorders contribute to\n7.5% of total Years Living with Disability (YLD) worldwide and this\ntranslates as the single largest contributor to global disability. According\nto this report, MDD contributes to 6.9% of total YLD in Malaysia.10\nTo ensure full functional recovery and prevention of relapse, the targeted\noutcome for treatment of MDD is treatment to remission. Remission can\nbe defined as a minimum of 80% reduction in symptoms of MDD or\nas an absolute cut-off score in any one validated rating scales.11, level\nIII Non-remission of depressive symptoms in MDD has implications on\nfunctionality12, level II-2 and can add to the economic burden of the illness. Management of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\nThis CPG is a full review of the previous edition of guidelines on the\nManagement of MDD published in 2007. In order to preserve the\nvalidity of these guidelines, new evidence in the management of MDD\nwas searched and critically appraised prior to being accepted. This\nCPG also minimises variation in clinical practices to adapt appropriate\nmanagement in MDD. Management of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\n3\n2. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS\n2.1 Screening\nIn a systematic review of local studies in Malaysia, prevalence of\ndepression in primary care ranged from 6.7% to 14.4%. Among the\nelderly in the general community, the prevalence was between 6.3%\nand 18%. In most of the studies, women had higher rates of depression\nthan men. Studies in a clinical setting found a prevalence of depression\nto be 20.7% in post-partum women, 36% in post-stroke patients and\n19.1% in breast cancer patients.

It should be implemented when there are adequate systems in\nplace to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment and appropriate\nfollow-up.14 However, in the absence of benefit in screening and\npresence of potential harms, the Canadian Preventive Task Force\nguidelines do not recommend routine screening for depression in\nprimary care settings, either in adults at average risk or in those with\ncharacteristics that may increase their risk of depression.15\nThe CPG DG suggests screening for depression in high risk individuals\nwith following history:16, level III\n\u2022 first-degree relative with a history of depression\n\u2022 chronic diseases\n\u2022 obesity\n\u2022 chronic pain (e.g. backache, headache)\n\u2022 impoverished home environment\n\u2022 financial constraint\n\u2022 experiencing major life changes\n\u2022 pregnant or postpartum period\n\u2022 socially-isolated\n\u2022 multiple vague symptoms\n\u2022 sleep disturbance\n\u2022 substance abuse (e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs)\n\u2022 loss of interest in sexual activity\n\u2022 old age\n\u2022 There is insufficient evidence to perform screening for depression in\nthe general population. The common tools used in Malaysia for screening of depression are\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI), Depression, Anxiety and Stress\nScale (DASS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Hospital\nManagement of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\nAnxiety Depression Scale (HADS).

Laboratory\ntests may be required, particularly if the presentation is atypical e.g. symptoms suggesting a medical cause, elderly patients, first major\ndepressive episode after the age of 40, absence of precipitating factors\nand depression not responding fully to the standard treatment.21\n2.3 Diagnosis and Assessment of Severity\nThe diagnosis of MDD is made using internationally accepted diagnostic\ncriteria i.e. either the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or\nthe ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorder: Clinical\nDescription & Diagnostic Guidelines. Based on the DSM-5 criteria, a minimum of five symptoms is required\nto diagnose MDD (refer to Appendix 3). Assessment of MDD severity is important to determine the mode of\ntreatment. The assessment is determined by the total number of\nsymptoms criteria, the severity of symptoms and the extent of functional\ndisability. According to DSM-5, the severity of MDD can be divided into mild,\nmoderate and severe. For mild depression, five or more symptoms\nare present which cause distress but they are manageable and result\nin minor impairment in social or occupational functioning. For severe\ndepression, most of the symptoms are present with marked impairment\nin functioning. It can present with or without psychotic symptoms. For moderate depression, both symptom presentation and functional\nimpairment lies between the above two severities. Another classification of the depression severity is based on ICD-10\ncriteria (refer to Appendix 4). The DSM-5 is widely used in clinical practice and research in local\nsetting.

Locally, the Malaysian Guidelines\non Suicide Prevention & Management and Guidelines on Suicide Risk\nManagement in Hospitals were developed to assist practitioners in\nsuicide preventive measures. A systematic review of 21 studies evaluating 15 suicide risk assessment\ninstruments on a group of suicide attempters, showed that none\nfulfilled requirements for diagnostic accuracy and there was insufficient\nevidence to support its use in predicting suicidal acts.23, level II-2 A recent\nmulticentre, population-level cohort study on individuals with self-harm\nepisodes, suggested that suicide risk assessment scales should not\nbe used alone to determine treatment options or predict future risk of\nfurther self-harm or suicide.24, level II-2 Therefore, suicide risk assessment\ninstruments should only be used to complement a detailed clinical\nassessment and a structured follow-up management plan, while\nbuilding a good therapeutic alliance with the patients. Assessment of suicide intent is a vital measurement to evaluate\nfuture suicide risk among patients who self-harm.25, level II-2 Hence,\nmeasurement of this risk should be included during the risk assessment\nand can be done using specific tools (e.g. Beck Suicide Intent Scale). The suicide risk factors are:21\n\u2022 loss of relationship\n\u2022 financial or occupational difficulties\n\u2022 poor social support\n\u2022 past suicide attempt\n\u2022 family history of suicide\n\u2022 alcohol abuse/dependence\n\u2022 other medical co-mordibities\n\u2022 suicidal ideations\n\u2022 severity of depression\n\u2022 psychomotor agitation\n\u2022 low self-esteem\n\u2022 hopelessness\nManagement of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\n7\n2.5 Referral and Admission\n2.5.1 Criteria for referral to psychiatric services\nThere is no new retrievable primary paper on referral of MDD.

PHASES OF TREATMENT\nGeneral principles of MDD treatment are:\n\u2022 to relieve symptoms\n\u2022 to reduce the morbidity and disability\n\u2022 to limit risks of self-harm and fatality\nTreatment of MDD can be divided into three phases - acute,\ncontinuation and maintenance (refer to Figure 1). For the purpose of\ndiscussion in this CPG, the continuation phase is considered as part of\nthe maintenance phase. Figure 1. Phases of treatment of major depression\nAdapted: Kupfer DJ.

Psychosocial Interventions and Psychotherapy\nEvidence on the effectiveness of psychological and psychosocial\ninterventions have mainly been found in the acute treatment of MDD,\nand mostly between mild to moderate severity. The general aim of\nthese interventions is to alleviate core depressive symptoms or prevent\nsymptoms recurring. There are psychological and psychosocial interventions of lower\nintensity that are less dependent on trained professionals and can\nbe self-guided (e.g. internet- and mobile-based intervention, exercise\nprogramme, etc.).20, 29\nThe types of interventions offered depends on patient\u2019s preferences and\nattitudes, therapist competence, therapeutic alliance and availability of\nthe intervention.20, 30\nPsychosocial Interventions\ni. Psychoeducation\nPsychoeducation is given by delivering information on pharmacotherapy\nand psychological measures which consist of topics on:\n\u2022 symptoms and course of depression\n\u2022 the biopsychosocial model of aetiology\n\u2022 pharmacotherapy for acute phase and maintenance\n\u2022 drug side effects and complications\n\u2022 importance of medication adherence\n\u2022 early signs of recurrence\n\u2022 management of relapse and recurrence\nPsychoeducation is an important component in the treatment of\ndepression. It is provided early and continuously throughout the\nmanagement of the condition. Management of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\nIn patients with <5 episodes, there was no difference between\nmanualised psychoeducation as an adjunct to an antidepressant in\npreventing relapse than maintenance cognitive behavioural therapy\n(CBT). However, in those with \u22655 previous major depressive episodes,\nmanualised psychoeducation is significantly less effective in similar\ncomparison.31, level I\nA randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that adding a family\nintervention to inpatient treatment of MDD over TAU improved BDI\nscores (p<0.005).

Psychospiritual Intervention\nIt is crucial to be culturally sensitive in providing mental health care. WHO has declared that spirituality is an important dimension of quality\nof life.40 The biopsychosocial and spiritual model41 is currently being\nwidely used. Definition of spirituality refers to \u2018a dimension of human experience\nrelated to the transcendent, the sacred, or to ultimate reality and is\nclosely related to values, meaning and purpose in life\u2019.

In a systematic review, all included studies were significantly in\nfavour of faith-adapted CBT in depression outcomes compared with\ncontrol (range of SMD= -1.20 to -3.07). Faith-adapted CBT is defined\nas 'integrated faith into established evidence-based treatments by\ncomponents of discussion of religious or scriptural teachings as\nsupportive evidence to counter irrational thoughts or to support\ncognitive or behavioural change; use of positive religious and spiritual\ncoping techniques; promotion of helpful belief or value systems or use\nof shared value systems to strengthen therapeutic relationships and\nincorporation of religious practices e.g. prayer\u2019.43, level I\nAnother systematic review showed beneficial effects of religious and\nspiritual interventions in reduction of depressive symptoms between\none and six months compared with control (SMD= -0.24 95% CI -0.48\nto 0.00).

B. Pharmacotherapy\nThere are four meta-analyses with moderate risk of bias of primary\npapers and one RCT on the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating\ndepression in elderly population. In a Cochrane systematic review on depression in elderly, TCAs, SSRIs\n(fluoxetine) and MAOIs were significantly more effective in preventing\npersistence of symptoms compared with placebo with NNT of 3.97\n(95% CI 3.88 to 4.05), 8.45 (95% CI 8.38 to 8.53) and 3.14 (95% CI 2.99\nto 3.29) respectively.185, level I However, in a recent meta-analysis using\ndifferent RCTs on several SSRIs (fluoxetine, escitalopram, citalopram)\nin depressed elderly, there was no significant difference in effectiveness\nbetween the SSRIs and placebo in both response and remission. On\nthe other hand, duloxetine was more effective than placebo in response\n(OR=2.83, 95% CI 1.96 to 4.08) and remission (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.20\nto 2.65).186, level I\nIn another Cochrane review, there was no difference in effectiveness\nbetween TCAs and SSRIs, MAOIs and \u2018atypical antidepressants\u2019\n(buspirone, buproprion, milnacipran, venlafaxine, reboxetine and\nmirtazapine) on depression in elderly.187, level I\nA recent Cochrane systematic review on three RCTs showed that\nantidepressants (SSRIs and TCAs) in continuation and maintenance\nphase in elderly with MDD reduced recurrence at 12 months compared\nwith placebo (RR=0.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.82; NNTB=5). However, the\ntrials included were of low quality with marked heterogeneity among\nthem.188, level I\nAn RCT showed no significant difference between sertraline and\nnortriptyline in response and remission rates of older adults with\nmelancholia or non-melancholia depression.189, level I\nSSRIs were less likely to cause withdrawal due to side effects compared\nwith TCAs (RR=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70) in elderly with depression. There was no significant difference in other comparison i.e. between\nTCAs and MAOIs or \u2018atypical antidepressants\u2019.187, level I\nCitalopram had larger proportion of adverse events (fatigue, sweating\nand tremors) compared with placebo in depressed elderly. There was\nManagement of Major Depressive Disorder (Second Edition)\n51\nno significant difference in frequency of AEs between other SSRIs in\nsimilar comparison. On the other hand, duloxetine was significantly\nassociated with increased risk of dry mouth, constipation, diarrhoea\nand dizziness compared with placebo.186, level I\nA cohort study of 60,746 elderly patients diagnosed with MDD showed\nthat SSRIs were associated with the highest risk for falls (HR=1.66, 95%\nCI 1.58 to 1.73) and hyponatraemia (HR=1.52, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.75)\ncompared with when the antidepressants were not being used.

There was no significant difference between unilateral and\nbilateral ECT in reduction of depression symptoms after five treatments\nor three weeks of treatment. Three-times weekly ECT was shown to\nhave lower depressive symptoms compared with once-weekly ECT at\nweek 4 (p<0.001).

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of MDD should be guided by evidence-based\napproach in order to provide quality care to the patients. Several factors\nmay affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG. 10.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG\ninclude:\na. wide dissemination of the CPG to healthcare providers (hard- and\nsoft-copies)\nb. regular topic update for healthcare providers via continuous\nmedical education (seminar/conference/course)\nc. involvement of governmental/NGOs e.g. World Mental Health Day,\nSuicide Prevention Day etc. d. accessibility to relevant multidisciplinary teams\nExisting barriers for application are:\na. low mental health literacy\nb. insufficient resources in terms of budget, expertise, medications,\naccess to psychotherapy\nc. no national registry\nd. variation in clinical management and preferences\ne. low priority on the issue by the stakeholders\n10.2 Potential Resource Implications\nTo implement the CPG, there must be strong commitment to:\na. ensure widespread distribution of the CPG to health care personnel\nvia printed copies, electronic websites, etc. b. reinforce training of health care personnel by regular seminars or\nworkshops to ensure information is made available\nc. develop multidisciplinary teams at hospital and community level\nto include involvement of specialists, medical/dental officers,\npharmacists, allied health professional and nurses\nThe following is proposed as a clinical audit indicator for quality\nmanagement of MDD:\nImplementation strategies will be developed following the approval of\nthe CPG by MoH which include launching of the CPG, Quick Reference\nand Training Module.
