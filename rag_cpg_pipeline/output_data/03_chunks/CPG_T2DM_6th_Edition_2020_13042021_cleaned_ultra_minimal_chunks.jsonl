MOH/P/PAK/447.20(GU)-e\nFOREWORD\nby Tan Sri Dato' Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah,\nDirector General of Health, Malaysia\nManagement of any chronic disease requires a concerted effort with the\nparticipation of all stake holders starting with the patients themselves and,\nclinical healthcare professionals as well as public health policymakers. This is\neven more important in the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An optimum result can only be achieved with a holistic approach and active\npatient participation with the support of appropriate diabetes education\nand lifestyle modification. In addition to its negative impact on the quality\nof life and health care costs, diabetes also increases the economic burden of\nindividuals, families and communities and, affects national productivity. I note that there has been a recent explosion of advances made in the\nmanagement of diabetic complications. The use of new technology and findings\nfrom landmark trials have changed clinical pathways and recommendations in\nthe way T2DM is managed. This has been reflected in the latest Clinical Practice\nGuidelines (CPG) for the Management of T2DM (6th Edition). These guidelines\nalso focus on preventing and reducing diabetes-related complications,\nthereby improving clinical outcomes. This CPG will form a valuable resource\nfor healthcare professionals from primary to tertiary care levels, to deliver the\nbest possible care for their patients, from disease prevention to treatment of\ncomplications. In this networked age, we should no longer be working in silos and I would\nlike to reaffirm the importance and recognition of a multidisciplinary approach\nin managing T2DM. I have been a champion for embracing technology and\ninnovation \u2013 and note that there is emphasis on the potential to use mobile\napps and other forms of technological advances / telemedicine to improve\ndiabetes self-management.", "chunk_order": 0}

Tan Sri Dato' Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nFOREWORD\nby Chairpersons of T2DM Clinical Practice Guidelines,\n6th edition taskforce\nThese are exciting times for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)\nand a time for concern. The past 5 years have seen amazing breakthroughs that\ngive hope for people with T2DM. Several Cardiovascular Outcome trials (CVOTs)\nfrom 2 new classes of glucose-lowering agents have shown cardiovascular (CV)\nprotection, beyond glucose. On the other hand, prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia continues to rise unabated. The 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) shows a prevalence\nof 18.3% (for adults >18 years of age), a 4% increase from 2015; 48.6% were\nundiagnosed. In addition, ~5.0% of our young Malaysians between 18-29 years\nare also diabetic. It is worrying to see this trend. The frequent co-existence with\nother well-known comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, dyslipidaemia, overweight/\nobesity further complicates the situation. The 5th edition of our Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of\nT2DM 2015, was detailed and comprehensive. Our aspiration was to build on\nthe previous CPG. Since then, there have been major advances; in therapeutics,\nnutrition, technology as well as, digital health. The landmark CVOTs have consistently demonstrated positive beneficial CV\noutcomes in those with either established or at high risk for cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD). Another exciting advance has been the discovery of a 2nd\ntherapeutic class of agent, apart from the renin-angiotensin system blockers,\nto directly reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD remains\nthe largest contributor of new patients requiring dialysis in Malaysia and,\nrecent renal outcome trials definitively show positive outcomes for prevention\nof progression to end-stage renal failure and reduction of albuminuria. More\nexciting data may be forthcoming with ongoing dedicated trials investigating\neffects of these glucose-lowering agents, on heart failure and prevention\nof kidney disease not only in people with diabetes but also, in nondiabetic\nindividuals.", "chunk_order": 1}

These results have led to paradigm shifts, changing practices as we move\nforward. The objective of these guidelines is to reflect the uptake of this\nnew data in clinical decision making and therefore, provide evidence-based\nrecommendations to assist healthcare providers in identifying, diagnosing and\nmanaging our patients with T2DM. Some of the other notable updates, include\nadditional sections on current hot topics; e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n(NAFLD) and periodontal disease. The landmark CVOTs have been consolidated\nand summarised in Appendix 8. T2DM is not a stand-alone disease instead reaching across a spectrum of other\nnon-communicable diseases. Hence, in this updated guideline, we expanded our\ntaskforce to include colleagues from other specialities; including nephrology,\nneurology, gastroenterology-hepatology, cardiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry\nand dental surgery. The committee hopes that this combination of expertise\nhas enhanced the recommendations in this CPG to further improve clinical\ndecision making. The development of these guidelines extended into an extraordinary situation\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through it, the hardworking committee\nmembers of the taskforce, including our reviewers, persevered with continuous\nand timely discussions to reach consensus where required through use of\ntechnology/remote communication, enabling its completion. To this, we extend\nour appreciation and gratitude, and commend their unwavering commitment\nto deliver the best evidence-based standard of care to our patients with T2DM.

These updated guidelines also include the latest cardiovascular outcome trials\n(CVOTs) and findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses in literature,\nall whilst taking into consideration local practices. Clinical questions were divided into major subgroups and members of\nthe task force were assigned individual topics within these subgroups. All\nliterature retrieved were critically appraised, presented and discussed during\ngroup meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated were\nagreed by the task force members. Where the evidence was insufficient, the\nrecommendations were derived by consensus of the task force members. The articles were graded using the criteria used by the Canadian Task Force\non the Periodic Health Examination, while the grading of recommendation in\nthis guideline was standardised with the previous edition of the T2DM CPG\n(5th edition) i.e. following the American Heart Association system, for easy\ncomparison. The rationale for the committee to do so is that the format for\nboth are familiar to our healthcare professionals and facilitates the CPG\u2019s ease\nof use.

Prediabetes is an important risk factor for future diabetes and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD). It is a potentially reversible condition with\nlifestyle modification. \u2022 T2DM is the most common form of diabetes mellitus, accounting for >90% of\nall cases of adult-onset diabetes mellitus in Malaysia. Both prediabetes and\ndiabetes commonly coexist with other non-communicable diseases namely\nhypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. \u2022 With a high and increasing global, and local prevalence, T2DM represents a\nhuge socio-economic burden due to increased morbidity from accelerated\nvascular complications and premature death. \u2022 T2DM is characterised by progressive decline in beta-cell function associated\nwith insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue. \u203a The insulin resistant state results in increased hepatic glucose output and\nreduced utilisation of glucose by various organs contributing to fasting\nhyperglycaemia and between meal hyperglycaemia. \u203a Impaired intestinal incretin secretion causes compromised meal-related\ninsulin secretion and glucagon suppression contributing to postprandial\nhyperglycaemia. \u203a Excessive renal tubular reabsorption of glucose further contributes to\nhyperglycaemia. \u2022 T2DM is an important risk factor for CVD and microvascular complications\nsuch as nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy. Other non-vascular\ncomplications include infective complications. SECTION 1\n\u2022 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obstructive sleep apnoea and an\nincreased risk of certain malignancies are common co-morbidities that are\nassociated with T2DM. \u2022 The main aim of management is directed at reducing acute and chronic\ndiabetes-related complications by targeting control of plasma glucose, BP,\nlipids and body weight concurrently. \u2022 Recently, there is evidence that reversal or remission of T2DM may be\npossible in some individuals with short duration of disease, following reversal\nof insulin resistance through significant and sustained weight loss by either\ncaloric restriction or bariatric surgery. 1.2 Prevalence and state of T2DM in Malaysia\n\u2022 The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 20191 (Level II-3) reported a\nprevalence of 23.6% for those with abnormal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in\nnon-diabetic range (FPG 5.6 mmol/L-6.9 mmol/L) at the time of the survey. This estimates approximately 5 million (5,019,359) adult individuals in\nMalaysia with probable prediabetes in 2019 and future risk of diabetes. \u2022 Prevalence of a known or established diagnosis of diabetes during the 2019\nNHMS was 9.4%, whilst in 2015 it was 8.3%.2 (level II-3) Hence in 2019, there\nwere almost 2 million (1,999,450) adult individuals with known diabetes in\nMalaysia. \u2022 Prevalence of unknown/undiagnosed diabetes (elevated fasting plasma\nglucose of \u22657.0 mmol/L during survey) for adults age \u226518 years; in NHMS\n2015 and 2019 were 5.1% and 8.9% respectively.1,2 (Level II-3)\n\u203a In 2019, there was an estimated 1,892,515 adult individuals with unknown/\nundiagnosed diabetes in Malaysia. \u203a 42% of those with unknown diabetes are between the age of 18-39 years,\nand 40% are between the age 40-59 years.", "chunk_order": 8}

The choice of insulin regimen should be individualised,\nbased on the patient\u2019s glycaemic profile, dietary\npattern and lifestyle. Grade C\n2. OGLDs may be continued. SU may need to be\nreduced/stopped when intensifying insulin. Grade A\n3. The biggest barrier is adherence, and this should\nbe adequately ascertained prior to any effort to\nintensify insulin therapy. Grade C\n4. Intensification of insulin therapy (i.e. increasing\nnumber of injections) should be considered if\nglycaemic targets are not met. Grade A\n5. Attention to weight gain, assessment for hunger/\ndefensive-eating behaviour and recognition of\npossibility of over-insulinisation is important.

They may be diffuse or focal.597\n\u2022 Diffuse neuropathies are:597\n\u203a distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN), and\n\u203a diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) particularly CV autonomic\nneuropathy. \u2022 Focal neuropathies include:597\n\u203a mononeuritis, and\n\u203a radiculopathies. Diabetic symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN)\n\u2022 The likelihood of having DSPN is higher in the presence of:598\n\u203a neuropathic symptoms,\n\u203a absent or decreased ankle reflex,\n\u203a decreased distal sensation,\n\u203a distal muscle weakness or atrophy, and\n\u203a abnormal nerve conduction study. SECTION 5\nMANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS\nA. Screening and diagnosis\n\u2022 DSPN should be assessed with a 10-g monofilament (starting from the\ndorsum of hallux, then moving proximally); and one other modality:\n\u203a pin prick,\n\u203a vibration sense using a 128-Hz tuning fork,\n\u203a ankle reflexes; or\n\u203a vibration perception threshold testing using a biothesiometer. These increase the sensitivity of detecting DSPN by 87%.599-602 (Level II-3)\n\u2022 These bedside tests should be performed at least annually.597 (Level III)\n\u2022 Consider screening for people with prediabetes/T2DM who have symptoms\nof peripheral neuropathy. \u2022 In most cases, DSPN can be diagnosed clinically and electrophysiological\ntests are rarely required. Electrophysiological tests can be considered if\nthere are atypical features:597 (Level III)\n\u203a rapid onset or progression of neuropathy,\n\u203a asymmetrical neuropathy,\n\u203a predominantly motor neuropathy,\n\u203a if other causes are considered; or\n\u203a in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. \u2022 Symptoms of neuropathic pain include:603\n\u203a burning pain,\n\u203a painful cold, electric shock-like pain\n\u203a tingling pain, or\n\u203a sensation of pins and needles, and\n\u203a may be associated with paraesthesia, dysesthesia, or allodynia. \u2022 Validated questionnaires are available to assess for neuropathic pain due to\nDSPN.

These CV benefits are seen irrespective of HbA1c level achieved. Paradigm shifts in management algorithm recommendations are\nemerging. \u2022 There is an emerging role of SGLT2-i to reduce heart failure\nhospitalisations in high risk ASCVD patients. \u2022 However, if these newer medications are not available, achieving\nHbA1c safely, remains an important target. \u2022 T2DM is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD),\nmanifesting as angina, MI, CCF and sudden death.

Those in high- and very high-risk\ncategories should abstain from fasting.890,891(Level III)\nSECTION 6\nT2DM IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS\nPreparation prior Ramadan\n\u2022 A pre-Ramadan medical assessment should be performed to categorise\npatients in terms of risks of fasting as well as to optimise their management. These include:\n\u203a general well-being,\n\u203a diabetes medications,\n\u203a glycaemic control,\n\u203a comorbidities; and\n\u203a complications. \u2022 Patients and caregivers should receive education concerning self-care\nregarding the following:892-894 (Level III)\n\u203a risks of adverse effect of fasting,\n\u203a SMBG,\n\u203a indications for termination of fasting,\n\u203a meal planning, food choices and fluid intake,\n\u203a exercise and physical activity; and\n\u203a modifications of glucose lowering medication (oral and in particular insulin). \u2022 Risks of adverse effect of fasting\n\u203a There are several potential risks associated with prolonged fasting. It\nis therefore important to increase patient awareness and to reduce\nrisks while, if possible, enabling patients to participate in their spiritual\nexperience of fasting during Ramadan. \u203a Adverse effects and risks associated with fasting include:\n- hypoglycaemia, especially during the late period of fasting before iftar,\n- severe hyperglycaemia after each of the main meals,\n- dehydration,\n- acute kidney injury in patients prone to dehydration, particularly elderly\npatients and those with impaired kidney function. \u2022 These diabetes-related risks can be minimised through education, appropriate\nfood choices and SMBG. During Ramadan\nA. Plasma glucose monitoring\n\u2022 Patients are advised to monitor their plasma glucose and most importantly\nwhen symptomatic of hypoglycaemia. \u2022 The frequency of SMBG depends on risk factors and current medications. \u203a For those at moderate or low risk, this may be once or twice a day. \u203a Those at high or very high risk should check their plasma glucose levels\nseveral times a day.

Note on acupuncture: Acupuncture has not been shown to improve glycaemic control in patients with\nT2DM. 8.2 Reporting adverse events\n\u2022 Healthcare professionals and consumers are encouraged to report any\nadverse events related to products intended to treat or cure diabetes to the\nMalaysian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (MADRAC) at www. npra.gov.my/index.php/en/health-professionals/reporting-adr 937\nRecommendations: Complementary and alternative therapy\n1.
